  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemistry of hydrogen.  For the physics of atomic hydrogen, see Hydrogen atom.  For other meanings, see Hydrogen (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Hydrogen</b> is a chemical element with chemical symbol&nbsp;<b>H</b> and atomic number&nbsp;1. With an atomic weight of 1.00794&nbsp;u (u for hydrogen-1), hydrogen is the lightest element and its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance, constituting roughly 75% of the Universe's baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state.</p>\n<p>At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H. Most of the hydrogen on Earth is in molecules such as water and organic compounds because hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base chemistry with many reactions exchanging protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, it can take a negative charge (an anion known as a hydride and written as H), or as a positively charged species H. The latter cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds always occur as more complex species.</p>\n<p>The most common isotope of hydrogen is <i>protium</i> (name rarely used, symbol H) with a single proton and no neutrons. As the simplest atom known, the hydrogen atom has been of theoretical use. For example, as the only neutral atom with an analytic solution to the Schrödinger equation, the study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century, via the mixing of metals with acids. In 1766–81, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name: in Greek, hydrogen means \"water-former\".</p>\n<p>Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.</p>\n\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<h3>Combustion</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Space Shuttle Main Engine burnt hydrogen with oxygen, producing a nearly invisible flame at full thrust.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hydrogen gas (dihydrogen or molecular hydrogen) is highly flammable and will burn in air at a very wide range of concentrations between 4% and 75% by volume. The enthalpy of combustion for hydrogen is −286&nbsp;kJ/mol:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 H(g) + O(g) → 2 HO(l) + 572&nbsp;kJ (286&nbsp;kJ/mol)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air if it is 4–74% concentrated and with chlorine if it is 5–95% concentrated. The mixtures may be ignited by spark, heat or sunlight. The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is 500 °C (932&nbsp;°F). Pure hydrogen-oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye, as illustrated by the faint plume of the Space Shuttle Main Engine compared to the highly visible plume of a Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster. The detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a flame detector; such leaks can be very dangerous. Hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue, resembling blue natural gas flames. The destruction of the Hindenburg airship was an infamous example of hydrogen combustion; the cause is debated, but the visible orange flames were the result of a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon compounds from the airship skin.</p>\n<p>H reacts with every oxidizing element. Hydrogen can react spontaneously and violently at room temperature with chlorine and fluorine to form the corresponding hydrogen halides, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, which are also potentially dangerous acids.</p>\n<h3>Electron energy levels</h3>\n<div>Main article: Hydrogen atom</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDepiction of a hydrogen atom with size of central proton shown, and the atomic diameter shown as about twice the Bohr model radius (image not to scale).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The ground state energy level of the electron in a hydrogen atom is −13.6&nbsp;eV, which is equivalent to an ultraviolet photon of roughly 92&nbsp;nm wavelength.</p>\n<p>The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the Bohr model of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as \"orbiting\" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the electromagnetic force attracts electrons and protons to one another, while planets and celestial objects are attracted to each other by gravity. Because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.</p>\n<p>A more accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a purely quantum mechanical treatment that uses the Schrödinger equation or the Feynman path integral formulation to calculate the probability density of the electron around the proton. The most complicated treatments allow for the small effects of special relativity and vacuum polarization. In the quantum mechanical treatment, the electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum at all— an illustration of how different the \"planetary orbit\" conception of electron motion differs from reality.</p>\n<h3>Elemental molecular forms</h3>\n<div>See also: Spin isomers of hydrogen</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFirst tracks observed in liquid hydrogen bubble chamber at the Bevatron</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>There exist two different spin isomers of hydrogen diatomic molecules that differ by the relative spin of their nuclei. In the orthohydrogen form, the spins of the two protons are parallel and form a triplet state with a molecular spin quantum number of 1 (½+½); in the parahydrogen form the spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular spin quantum number of 0 (½–½). At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form, also known as the \"normal form\". The equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature, but because the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form, it is unstable and cannot be purified. At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as discussed more fully in Spin isomers of hydrogen. The ortho/para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups, such as water and methylene, but is of little significance for their thermal properties.</p>\n<p>The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H increases with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H contains large quantities of the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly. The ortho/para ratio in condensed H is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.</p>\n<h3>Phases</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Compressed hydrogen</li>\n<li>Liquid hydrogen</li>\n<li>Slush hydrogen</li>\n<li>Solid hydrogen</li>\n<li>Metallic hydrogen</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>Further information: Hydrogen compounds</div>\n<h4>Covalent and organic compounds</h4>\n<p>While H is not very reactive under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements. Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative, such as halogens (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), or oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge. When bonded to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding called hydrogen bonding, which is critical to the stability of many biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as the metals and metalloids, in which it takes on a partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as hydrides.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon called the hydrocarbons, and an even vaster array with heteroatoms that, because of their general association with living things, are called organic compounds. The study of their properties is known as organic chemistry and their study in the context of living organisms is known as biochemistry. By some definitions, \"organic\" compounds are only required to contain carbon. However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word \"organic\" in chemistry. Millions of hydrocarbons are known, and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways, which seldom involve elementary hydrogen.</p>\n<h4>Hydrides</h4>\n<p>Compounds of hydrogen are often called hydrides, a term that is used fairly loosely. The term \"hydride\" suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element. The existence of the hydride anion, suggested by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916 for group I and II salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten lithium hydride (LiH), producing a stoichiometry quantity of hydrogen at the anode. For hydrides other than group I and II metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group II hydrides is BeH\n2, which is polymeric. In lithium aluminium hydride, the AlH−\n4 anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).</p>\n<p>Although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements, the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely; for example, there are over 100 binary borane hydrides known, but only one binary aluminium hydride. Binary indium hydride has not yet been identified, although larger complexes exist.</p>\n<p>In inorganic chemistry, hydrides can also serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex. This function is particularly common in group 13 elements, especially in boranes (boron hydrides) and aluminium complexes, as well as in clustered carboranes.</p>\n<h4>Protons and acids</h4>\n<div>Further information: Acid–base reaction</div>\n<p>Oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives H, which contains no electrons and a nucleus which is usually composed of one proton. That is why H+ is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of acids. Under the Bronsted-Lowry theory, acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.</p>\n<p>A bare proton, H+, cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals, because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from the electron clouds of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted \"H+\" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species.</p>\n<p>To avoid the implication of the naked \"solvated proton\" in solution, acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species, termed the \"hydronium ion\" (H\n3O+). However, even in this case, such solvated hydrogen cations are thought more realistically physically to be organized into clusters that form species closer to H\n9O+\n4. Other oxonium ions are found when water is in solution with other solvents.</p>\n<p>Although exotic on Earth, one of the most common ions in the universe is the H+\n3 ion, known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the trihydrogen cation.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of hydrogen</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHydrogen discharge (spectrum) tube</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDeuterium discharge (spectrum) tube</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nProtium, the most common isotope of hydrogen, has one proton and one electron. Unique among all stable isotopes, it has no neutrons (see diproton for a discussion of why others do not exist).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes, denoted 1H, 2H and 3H. Other, highly unstable nuclei (4H to 7H) have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1H</b> is the most common hydrogen isotope with an abundance of more than 99.98%. Because the nucleus of this isotope consists of only a single proton, it is given the descriptive but rarely used formal name <i>protium</i>.</li>\n<li><b>2H</b>, the other stable hydrogen isotope, is known as <i>deuterium</i> and contains one proton and one neutron in its nucleus. Essentially all deuterium in the universe is thought to have been produced at the time of the Big Bang, and has endured since that time. Deuterium is not radioactive, and does not represent a significant toxicity hazard. Water enriched in molecules that include deuterium instead of normal hydrogen is called heavy water. Deuterium and its compounds are used as a non-radioactive label in chemical experiments and in solvents for 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Heavy water is used as a neutron moderator and coolant for nuclear reactors. Deuterium is also a potential fuel for commercial nuclear fusion.</li>\n<li><b>3H</b> is known as <i>tritium</i> and contains one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus. It is radioactive, decaying into helium-3 through beta decay with a half-life of 12.32 years. It is so radioactive that it can be used in luminous paint, making it useful in such things as watches. The glass prevents the small amount of radiation from getting out. Small amounts of tritium occur naturally because of the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases; tritium has also been released during nuclear weapons tests. It is used in nuclear fusion reactions, as a tracer in isotope geochemistry, and specialized in self-powered lighting devices. Tritium has also been used in chemical and biological labeling experiments as a radiolabel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today. During the early study of radioactivity, various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names, but such names are no longer used, except for deuterium and tritium. The symbols D and T (instead of 2H and 3H) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the corresponding symbol for protium, P, is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not available for protium. In its nomenclatural guidelines, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry allows any of D, T, 2H, and 3H to be used, although 2H and 3H are preferred.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Discovery and use</h3>\n<div>Main article: Timeline of hydrogen technologies</div>\n<p>In 1671, Robert Boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids, which results in the production of hydrogen gas. In 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction \"flammable air\". He speculated that \"flammable air\" was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called \"phlogiston\" and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned. He is usually given credit for its discovery as an element. In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen (from the Greek <i>ὕδρω</i> <i>hydro</i> meaning water and <i>γενῆς</i> <i>genes</i> meaning creator) when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAntoine-Laurent de Lavoisier</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Lavoisier produced hydrogen for his famous experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic iron through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire. Anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fe + &nbsp;&nbsp; HO → FeO + H</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Fe + 3 HO → FeO + 3 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 Fe + 4 HO → FeO + 4 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Many metals such as zirconium undergo a similar reaction with water leading to the production of hydrogen.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.</p>\n<p>The first hydrogen-filled balloon was invented by Jacques Charles in 1783. Hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by Henri Giffard. German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called Zeppelins; the first of which had its maiden flight in 1900. Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.</p>\n<p>The first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the British airship <i>R34</i> in 1919. Regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of helium reserves in the United States promised increased safety, but the U.S. government refused to sell the gas for this purpose. Therefore, H was used in the Hindenburg airship, which was destroyed in a midair fire over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed. Ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause, but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the aluminized fabric coating by static electricity. But the damage to hydrogen's reputation as a lifting gas was already done.</p>\n<p>In the same year the first hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at Dayton, Ohio, by the Dayton Power &amp; Light Co, because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas this is the most common type in its field today.</p>\n<p>The nickel hydrogen battery was used for the first time in 1977 aboard the U.S. Navy's Navigation technology satellite-2 (NTS-2). For example, the ISS, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Global Surveyor are equipped with nickel-hydrogen batteries. In the dark part of its orbit, the Hubble Space Telescope is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries, which were finally replaced in May 2009, more than 19 years after launch, and 13 years over their design life.</p>\n<h3>Role in quantum theory</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHydrogen emission spectrum lines in the visible range. These are the four visible lines of the Balmer series</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Because of its relatively simple atomic structure, consisting only of a proton and an electron, the hydrogen atom, together with the spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it, has been central to the development of the theory of atomic structure. Furthermore, the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation H+\n2 allowed fuller understanding of the nature of the chemical bond, which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid-1920s.</p>\n<p>One of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.</p>\n<h2>Natural occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNGC 604, a giant region of ionized hydrogen in the Triangulum Galaxy</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hydrogen, as atomic H, is the most abundant chemical element in the universe, making up 75% of normal matter by mass and over 90% by number of atoms (most of the mass of the universe, however, is not in the form of chemical-element type matter, but rather is postulated to occur as yet-undetected forms of mass such as dark matter and dark energy). This element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets. Molecular clouds of H are associated with star formation. Hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through proton-proton reaction and CNO cycle nuclear fusion.</p>\n<p>Throughout the universe, hydrogen is mostly found in the atomic and plasma states whose properties are quite different from molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to redshift <i>z</i>=4.</p>\n<p>Under ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H (for data see table). However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (1 ppm by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from Earth's gravity more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface, mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water. Hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus, as is methane, itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance.</p>\n<p>A molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen (H+\n3) is found in the interstellar medium, where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays. This charged ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet Jupiter. The ion is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density. H+\n3 is one of the most abundant ions in the Universe, and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Neutral triatomic hydrogen H can only exist in an excited form and is unstable. By contrast, the positive hydrogen molecular ion (H+\n2) is a rare molecule in the universe.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>For more details on this topic, see Hydrogen production.</div>\n<p>H is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories, often as a by-product of other reactions; in industry for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates; and in nature as a means of expelling reducing equivalents in biochemical reactions.</p>\n<h3>Laboratory</h3>\n<p>In the laboratory, H is usually prepared by the reaction of dilute non-oxidizing acids on some reactive metals such as zinc with Kipp's apparatus.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Zn + 2 H+ → Zn2+ + H\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Aluminium can also produce H\n2 upon treatment with bases:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Al + 6 H\n2O + 2 OH− → 2 Al(OH)−\n4 + 3 H\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 H\n2O(l) → 2 H\n2(g) + O\n2(g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In 2007, it was discovered that an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet form added to water could be used to generate hydrogen. The process also creates alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported.</p>\n<h3>Industrial</h3>\n<div>Main article: Hydrogen production</div>\n<p>Hydrogen can be prepared in several different ways, but economically the most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons. Commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the steam reforming of natural gas. At high temperatures (1000–1400&nbsp;K, 700–1100&nbsp;°C or 1300–2000&nbsp;°F), steam (water vapor) reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and H\n2.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>CH\n4 + H\n2O → CO + 3 H\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures (2.0 &nbsp;MPa, 20&nbsp;atm or 600&nbsp;inHg). This is because high-pressure H\n2 is the most marketable product and Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) purification systems work better at higher pressures. The product mixture is known as \"synthesis gas\" because it is often used directly for the production of methanol and related compounds. Hydrocarbons other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios. One of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>CH\n4 → C + 2 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Consequently, steam reforming typically employs an excess of H\n2O. Additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the water gas shift reaction, especially with an iron oxide catalyst. This reaction is also a common industrial source of carbon dioxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>CO + H\n2O → CO\n2 + H\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Other important methods for H\n2 production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 CH\n4 + O\n2 → 2 CO + 4 H\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>and the coal reaction, which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>C + H\n2O → CO + H\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process, without being separated. In the Haber process for the production of ammonia, hydrogen is generated from natural gas. Electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co-product.</p>\n<h3>Thermochemical</h3>\n<p>There are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for water splitting, around a dozen of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle, cerium(IV) oxide-cerium(III) oxide cycle, zinc zinc-oxide cycle, sulfur-iodine cycle, copper-chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity. A number of laboratories (including in France, Germany, Greece, Japan, and the USA) are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water.</p>\n<h3>Anaerobic corrosion</h3>\n<p>Under anaerobic conditions, iron and steel alloys are slowly oxidized by the protons of water concomitantly reduced in molecular hydrogen (H). The anaerobic corrosion of iron leads first to the formation of ferrous hydroxide (green rust) and can be described by the following reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Fe + 2 HO → Fe(OH) + H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In its turn, under anaerobic conditions, the ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH) ) can be oxidized by the protons of water to form magnetite and molecular hydrogen. This process is described by the Schikorr reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 Fe(OH) → FeO + 2 HO + H</dd>\n<dd><i>ferrous hydroxide → magnetite + water + hydrogen</i></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The well crystallized magnetite (FeO) is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH) ).</p>\n<p>This process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of iron and steel in oxygen-free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table.</p>\n<h3>Geological occurrence: the serpentinization reaction</h3>\n<p>In the absence of atmospheric oxygen (O), in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from Earth atmosphere, hydrogen (H) is produced during the process of serpentinization by the anaerobic oxidation by the water protons (H) of the ferrous (Fe) silicate present in the crystal lattice of the fayalite (FeSiO, the olivine iron-endmember). The corresponding reaction leading to the formation of magnetite (FeO), quartz (SiO) and hydrogen (H) is the following:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 FeSiO + 2 HO → 2 FeO + 3 SiO + 3 H</dd>\n<dd><i>fayalite + water → magnetite + quartz + hydrogen</i></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction closely resembles the Schikorr reaction observed in the anaerobic oxidation of the ferrous hydroxide in contact with water.</p>\n<h3>Formation in transformers</h3>\n<p>From all the fault gases formed in power transformers, hydrogen is the most common and is generated under most fault conditions; thus, formation of hydrogen is an early indication of serious problems in the transformer's life cycle.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Consumption in processes</h3>\n<p>Large quantities of H\n2 are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries. The largest application of H\n2 is for the processing (\"upgrading\") of fossil fuels, and in the production of ammonia. The key consumers of H\n2 in the petrochemical plant include hydrodealkylation, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrocracking. H\n2 has several other important uses. H\n2 is used as a hydrogenating agent, particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and oils (found in items such as margarine), and in the production of methanol. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid. H\n2 is also used as a reducing agent of metallic ores.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.</p>\n<p>Apart from its use as a reactant, H\n2 has wide applications in physics and engineering. It is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding. H is used as the rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations, because it has the highest thermal conductivity of any gas. Liquid H is used in cryogenic research, including superconductivity studies. Because H\n2 is lighter than air, having a little more than ⁄ of the density of air, it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships.</p>\n<p>In more recent applications, hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen (sometimes called forming gas) as a tracer gas for minute leak detection. Applications can be found in the automotive, chemical, power generation, aerospace, and telecommunications industries. Hydrogen is an authorized food additive (E 949) that allows food package leak testing among other anti-oxidizing properties.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen's rarer isotopes also each have specific applications. Deuterium (hydrogen-2) is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow neutrons, and in nuclear fusion reactions. Deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of reaction isotope effects. Tritium (hydrogen-3), produced in nuclear reactors, is used in the production of hydrogen bombs, as an isotopic label in the biosciences, and as a radiation source in luminous paints.</p>\n<p>The triple point temperature of equilibrium hydrogen is a defining fixed point on the ITS-90 temperature scale at 13.8033&nbsp;kelvins.</p>\n<h3>Coolant</h3>\n<div>Main article: Hydrogen-cooled turbo generator</div>\n<p>Hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules. These include low density, low viscosity, and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases.</p>\n<h3>Energy carrier</h3>\n<div>See also: Hydrogen economy&nbsp;and Hydrogen infrastructure</div>\n<p>Hydrogen is not an energy resource, except in the hypothetical context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium, a technology presently far from development. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources require more energy to make it than is obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier, like a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable.</p>\n<p>The energy density per unit <i>volume</i> of both liquid hydrogen and compressed hydrogen gas at any practicable pressure is significantly less than that of traditional fuel sources, although the energy density per unit fuel <i>mass</i> is higher. Nevertheless, elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy, as a possible future <i>carrier</i> of energy on an economy-wide scale. For example, CO\n2 sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage could be conducted at the point of H\n2 production from fossil fuels. Hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly, with some NO emissions, but without carbon emissions. However, the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial.</p>\n<h3>Semiconductor industry</h3>\n<p>Hydrogen is employed to saturate broken (\"dangling\") bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties. It is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials, including ZnO, SnO, CdO, MgO, ZrO, HfO, LaO, YO, TiO, SrTiO, LaAlO, SiO, AlO, ZrSiO, HfSiO, and SrZrO.</p>\n<h2>Biological reactions</h2>\n<div>Further information: Biohydrogen&nbsp;and&nbsp;Biological hydrogen production</div>\n<p>H is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water.</p>\n<p>Water splitting, in which water is decomposed into its component protons, electrons, and oxygen, occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms. Some such organisms, including the alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> and cyanobacteria, have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form H gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast. Efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize H gas even in the presence of oxygen. Efforts have also been undertaken with genetically modified alga in a bioreactor.</p>\n<h2>Safety and precautions</h2>\n<div>Main article: Hydrogen safety</div>\n<p>Hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety, from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.</p>\n<p>Even interpreting the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded by a number of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.</p>"

For the uses of gases, and other meanings, see Gas (disambiguation).</div>\n<p><i>For the automotive fuel, see gasoline.</i></p>\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGas phase particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) move around freely in the absence of an applied electric field.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p><b>Gas</b> is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas or atomic gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image.</p>\n<p>The gaseous state of matter is found between the liquid and plasma states, the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases. Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention. High-density atomic gases super cooled to incredibly low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either a Bose gas or a Fermi gas. For a comprehensive listing of these exotic states of matter see list of states of matter.</p>\n\n<h2>Elemental gases</h2>\n<p>The only chemical elements which are stable multi atom homonuclear molecules at standard temperature and pressure (STP), are hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O); plus two halogens, fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl). These gases, when grouped together with the monatomic noble gases&nbsp;; which are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe) and radon (Rn)&nbsp;; are called \"elemental gases\". Alternatively they are sometimes known as \"molecular gases\" to distinguish them from molecules that are also chemical compounds.</p>\n<h2>Etymology</h2>\n<p>The word <i>gas</i> is a neologism first used by the early 17th century Flemish chemist J.B. Van Helmont. Van Helmont's word appears to have been simply a phonetic transcription of the Greek word χάος <i>Chaos</i> – the <i>g</i> in Dutch being pronounced like the English <i>ch</i> – in which case Van Helmont was simply following the established alchemical usage first attested in the works of Paracelsus. According to Paracelsus's terminology, <i>chaos</i> meant something like \"ultra-rarefied water\".</p>\n<h2>Physical characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDrifting smoke particles provide clues to the movement of the surrounding gas.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As most gases are difficult to observe directly, they are described through the use of four physical properties or macroscopic characteristics: pressure, volume, number of particles (chemists group them by moles) and temperature. These four characteristics were repeatedly observed by scientists such as Robert Boyle, Jacques Charles, John Dalton, Joseph Gay-Lussac and Amedeo Avogadro for a variety of gases in various settings. Their detailed studies ultimately led to a mathematical relationship among these properties expressed by the ideal gas law (see simplified models section below).</p>\n<p>Gas particles are widely separated from one another, and consequently have weaker intermolecular bonds than liquids or solids. These intermolecular forces result from electrostatic interactions between gas particles. Like-charged areas of different gas particles repel, while oppositely charged regions of different gas particles attract one another; gases that contain permanently charged ions are known as plasmas. Gaseous compounds with polar covalent bonds contain permanent charge imbalances and so experience relatively strong intermolecular forces, although the molecule while the compound's net charge remains neutral. Transient, randomly-induced charges exist across non-polar covalent bonds of molecules and electrostatic interactions caused by them are referred to as Van der Waals forces. The interaction of these intermolecular forces varies within a substance which determines many of the physical properties unique to each gas. A comparison of <i>boiling points</i> for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds leads us to this conclusion. The drifting smoke particles in the image provides some insight into low pressure gas behavior.</p>\n<p>Compared to the other states of matter, gases have low density and viscosity. Pressure and temperature influence the particles within a certain volume. This variation in particle separation and speed is referred to as <i>compressibility</i>. This particle separation and size influences optical properties of gases as can be found in the following list of refractive indices. Finally, gas particles spread apart or diffuse in order to homogeneously distribute themselves throughout any container.</p>\n<h2>Macroscopic</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nShuttle imagery of re-entry phase.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When observing a gas, it is typical to specify a frame of reference or length scale. A <i>larger</i> length scale corresponds to a macroscopic or global point of view of the gas. This region (referred to as a volume) must be sufficient in size to contain a large sampling of gas particles. The resulting statistical analysis of this sample size produces the <b>\"average\"</b> behavior (i.e. velocity, temperature or pressure) of all the gas particles within the region. In contrast, a <i>smaller</i> length scale corresponds to a microscopic or particle point of view.</p>\n<p>Macroscopically, the gas characteristics measured are either in terms of the gas particles themselves (velocity, pressure, or temperature) or their surroundings (volume). For example, Robert Boyle studied pneumatic chemistry for a small portion of his career. One of his experiments related the macroscopic properties of pressure and volume of a gas. His experiment used a J-tube manometer which looks like a test tube in the shape of the letter J. Boyle trapped an inert gas in the closed end of the test tube with a column of mercury, thereby making the number of particles and the temperature constant. He observed that when the pressure was increased in the gas, by adding more mercury to the column, the trapped gas' volume decreased (this is known as an inverse relationship). Furthermore, when Boyle multiplied the pressure and volume of each observation, the product was constant. This relationship held for every gas that Boyle observed leading to the law, (PV=k), named to honor his work in this field.</p>\n<p>There are many mathematical tools available for analyzing gas properties. As gases are subjected to extreme conditions, these tools become a bit more complex, from the Euler equations for inviscid flow to the Navier-Stokes equations that fully account for viscous effects. These equations are adapted to the conditions of the gas system in question. Boyle's lab equipment allowed the use of algebra to obtain his analytical results. His results were possible because he was studying gases in relatively low pressure situations where they behaved in an \"ideal\" manner. These ideal relationships apply to safety calculations for a variety of flight conditions on the materials in use. The high technology equipment in use today was designed to help us safely explore the more exotic operating environments where the gases no longer behave in an \"ideal\" manner. This advanced math, including statistics and multivariable calculus, makes possible the solution to such complex dynamic situations as space vehicle reentry. An example is the analysis of the space shuttle reentry pictured to ensure the material properties under this loading condition are appropriate. In this flight regime, the gas is no longer behaving ideally.</p>\n<h3>Pressure</h3>\n<div>Main article: Pressure</div>\n<p>The symbol used to represent <i>pressure</i> in equations is <b>\"p\"</b> or <b>\"P\"</b> with SI units of pascals.</p>\n<p>When describing a container of gas, the term pressure (or absolute pressure) refers to the average force per unit area that the gas exerts on the surface of the container. Within this volume, it is sometimes easier to visualize the gas particles moving in straight lines until they collide with the container (see diagram at top of the article). The force imparted by a gas particle into the container during this collision is the change in momentum of the particle. During a collision only the normal (geometry) component of velocity changes. A particle traveling parallel to the wall does not change its momentum. Therefore the average force on a surface must be the average change in linear momentum from all of these gas particle collisions.</p>\n<p>Pressure is the sum of all the normal components of force exerted by the particles impacting the walls of the container divided by the surface area of the wall.</p>\n<h3>Temperature</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-videopayload=\"&lt;div class=&quot;mediaContainer&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;width:320px&quot;&gt;&lt;video id=&quot;mwe_player_1&quot; style=&quot;width:320px;height:240px&quot; poster=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Nitrogen.ogg/320px--Nitrogen.ogg.jpg&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;kskin&quot; data-durationhint=&quot;14.931034482759&quot; data-startoffset=&quot;0&quot; data-mwtitle=&quot;Nitrogen.ogg&quot; data-mwprovider=&quot;wikimediacommons&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Nitrogen.ogg&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg; codecs=&amp;quot;theora&amp;quot;&quot; data-title=&quot;Original Ogg file, 320 × 240 (226 kbps)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;Ogg source&quot; data-width=&quot;320&quot; data-height=&quot;240&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;226105&quot; data-framerate=&quot;29&quot; /&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/b/b6/Nitrogen.ogg/Nitrogen.ogg.360p.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm; codecs=&amp;quot;vp8, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; transcodekey=&quot;360p.webm&quot; data-title=&quot;Web streamable WebM (360P)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;WebM 360P&quot; data-width=&quot;320&quot; data-height=&quot;240&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;518936&quot; data-framerate=&quot;29&quot; /&gt;Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.&lt;br /&gt;\nYou can &lt;a href=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Nitrogen.ogg&quot;&gt;download the clip&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TimedMediaHandler/Client_download&quot;&gt;download a player&lt;/a&gt; to play the clip in your browser.&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAir balloon shrinks after submersion in liquid nitrogen</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Thermodynamic temperature</div>\n<p>The symbol used to represent <i>temperature</i> in equations is <i>T</i> with SI units of kelvins.</p>\n<p>The speed of a gas particle is proportional to its absolute temperature. The volume of the balloon in the video shrinks when the trapped gas particles slow down with the addition of extremely cold nitrogen. The temperature of any physical system is related to the motions of the particles (molecules and atoms) which make up the [gas] system. In statistical mechanics, temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy stored in a particle. The methods of storing this energy are dictated by the degrees of freedom of the particle itself (energy modes). Kinetic energy added (endothermic process) to gas particles by way of collisions produces linear, rotational, and vibrational motion. In contrast, a molecule in a solid can only increase its vibrational modes with the addition of heat as the lattice crystal structure prevents both linear and rotational motions. These heated gas molecules have a greater speed range which constantly varies due to constant collisions with other particles. The speed range can be described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Use of this distribution implies ideal gases near thermodynamic equilibrium for the system of particles being considered.</p>\n<h3>Specific volume</h3>\n<div>Main article: Specific volume</div>\n<p>The symbol used to represent <i>specific volume</i> in equations is <b>\"v\"</b> with SI units of cubic meters per kilogram.</p>\n<div>See also: Gas volume</div>\n<p>The symbol used to represent <b>volume</b> in equations is <b>\"V\"</b> with SI units of cubic meters.</p>\n<p>When performing a thermodynamic analysis, it is typical to speak of intensive and extensive properties. Properties which depend on the amount of gas (either by mass or volume) are called <i>extensive</i> properties, while properties that do not depend on the amount of gas are called <i>intensive</i> properties. <b>Specific volume</b> is an example of an <i>intensive</i> property because it is the ratio of volume occupied by a <i>unit of mass</i> of a gas that is identical throughout a system at equilibrium. 1000 atoms a gas occupy the same space as any other 1000 atoms for any given temperature and pressure. This concept is easier to visualize for solids such as iron which are incompressible compared to gases. Since a gas fills any container in which it is placed, <b>volume</b> is an <i>extensive property</i>.</p>\n<h3>Density</h3>\n<div>Main article: Density</div>\n<p>The symbol used to represent <b>density</b> in equations is <b>ρ</b> (rho) with SI units of kilograms per cubic meter. This term is the reciprocal of specific volume.</p>\n<p>Since gas molecules can move freely within a container, their mass is normally characterized by <b>density</b>. Density is the amount of mass per unit volume of a substance, or the inverse of specific volume. For gases, the density can vary over a wide range because the particles are free to move closer together when constrained by pressure or volume. This variation of density is referred to as compressibility. Like pressure and temperature, density is a state variable of a gas and the change in density during any process is governed by the laws of thermodynamics. For a static gas, the density is the same throughout the entire container. Density is therefore a scalar quantity. It can be shown by <b>kinetic theory</b> that the density is <i>inversely</i> proportional to the size of the container in which a fixed mass of gas is confined. In this case of a fixed mass, the density decreases as the volume increases.</p>\n<h2>Microscopic</h2>\n<p>If one could observe a gas under a powerful microscope, one would see a collection of particles (molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, etc.) without any definite shape or volume that are in more or less random motion. These neutral gas particles only change direction when they collide with another particle or with the sides of the container. In an ideal gas, these collisions are perfectly elastic. This particle or microscopic view of a gas is described by the Kinetic-molecular theory. The assumptions behind this theory can be found in the postulates section of Kinetic Theory.</p>\n<h3>Kinetic theory</h3>\n<div>Main article: Kinetic theory</div>\n<p><b>Kinetic theory</b> provides insight into the macroscopic properties of gases by considering their molecular composition and motion. Starting with the definitions of momentum and kinetic energy, one can use the conservation of momentum and geometric relationships of a cube to relate macroscopic system properties of temperature and pressure to the microscopic property of kinetic energy per molecule. The theory provides averaged values for these two properties.</p>\n<p>The theory also explains how the gas system responds to change. For example, as a gas is heated from absolute zero, when it is (in theory) perfectly still, its internal energy (temperature) is increased. As a gas is heated, the particles speed up and its temperature rises. This results in greater numbers of collisions with the container per unit time due to the higher particle speeds associated with elevated temperatures. The pressure increases in proportion to the number of collisions per unit time.</p>\n<h3>Brownian motion</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRandom motion of gas particles results in diffusion.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Brownian motion</div>\n<p>Brownian motion is the mathematical model used to describe the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid. The gas particle animation, using pink and green particles, illustrates how this behavior results in the spreading out of gases (entropy). These events are also described by particle theory.</p>\n<p>Since it is at the limit of (or beyond) current technology to observe individual gas particles (atoms or molecules), only theoretical calculations give suggestions about how they move, but their motion is different from Brownian motion because Brownian motion involves a smooth drag due to the frictional force of many gas molecules, punctuated by violent collisions of an individual (or several) gas molecule(s) with the particle. The particle (generally consisting of millions or billions of atoms) thus moves in a jagged course, yet not so jagged as would be expected if an individual gas molecule were examined.</p>\n<h3>Intermolecular forces</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWhen gases are compressed, intermolecular forces like those shown here start to play a more active role.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main articles: van der Waals force and Intermolecular force</div>\n<p>As discussed earlier, momentary attractions (or repulsions) between particles have an effect on gas dynamics. In physical chemistry, the name given to these intermolecular forces is <i>van der Waals force</i>. These forces play a key role in determining physical properties of a gas such as viscosity and flow rate (see physical characteristics section). Ignoring these forces in certain conditions (see Kinetic-molecular theory) allows a real gas to be treated like an ideal gas. This assumption allows the use of ideal gas laws which greatly simplifies calculations.</p>\n<p>Proper use of these gas relationships requires the Kinetic-molecular theory (KMT). When gas particles possess a magnetic charge or Intermolecular force they gradually influence one another as the spacing between them is reduced (the hydrogen bond model illustrates one example). In the absence of any charge, at some point when the spacing between gas particles is greatly reduced they can no longer avoid collisions between themselves at normal gas temperatures. Another case for increased collisions among gas particles would include a fixed volume of gas, which upon heating would contain very fast particles. <i>This means that these ideal equations provide reasonable results</i> except <i>for extremely high pressure (compressible) or high temperature (ionized) conditions.</i> Notice that all of these excepted conditions allow energy transfer to take place within the gas system. The absence of these internal transfers is what is referred to as ideal conditions in which the energy exchange occurs only at the boundaries of the system. Real gases experience some of these collisions and intermolecular forces. When these collisions are statistically negligible (incompressible), results from these ideal equations are still meaningful. If the gas particles are compressed into close proximity they behave more like a liquid (see fluid dynamics).</p>\n<h2>Simplified models</h2>\n<div>Main article: Equation of state</div>\n<p>An <i>equation of state</i> (for gases) is a mathematical model used to roughly describe or predict the state properties of a gas. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all gases under all conditions. Therefore, a number of much more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases in specific temperature and pressure ranges. The \"gas models\" that are most widely discussed are \"perfect gas\", \"ideal gas\" and \"real gas\". Each of these models has its own set of assumptions to facilitate the analysis of a given thermodynamic system. Each successive model expands the temperature range of coverage to which it applies.</p>\n<h3>Ideal and perfect gas models</h3>\n<div>Main article: Perfect gas</div>\n<p>The equation of state for an ideal or perfect gas is the ideal gas law and reads</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>where <i>P</i> is the pressure, <i>V</i> is the volume, <i>n</i> is amount of gas (in mol units), <i>R</i> is the universal gas constant, 8.314&nbsp;J/(mol&nbsp;K), and <i>T</i> is the temperature. Written this way, it is sometimes called the \"chemist's version\", since it emphasizes the number of molecules <i>n</i>. It can also be written as</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>where  is the specific gas constant for a particular gas, in units J/(kg&nbsp;K), and ρ = m/V is density. This notation is the \"gas dynamicist's\" version, which is more practical in modeling of gas flows involving acceleration without chemical reactions.</p>\n<p>The ideal gas law does not make an assumption about the specific heat of a gas. In the most general case, the specific heat is a function of both temperature and pressure. If the pressure-dependence is neglected (and possibly the temperature-dependence as well) in a particular application, sometimes the gas is said to be a perfect gas, although the exact assumptions may vary depending on the author and/or field of science.</p>\n<p>For an ideal gas, the ideal gas law applies without restrictions on the specific heat. An ideal gas is a simplified \"real gas\" with the assumption that the compressibility factor <i>Z</i> is set to 1 meaning that this pneumatic ratio remains constant. A compressibility factor of one also requires the four state variables to follow the ideal gas law.</p>\n<p>This approximation is more suitable for applications in engineering although simpler models can be used to produce a \"ball-park\" range as to where the real solution should lie. An example where the \"ideal gas approximation\" would be suitable would be inside a combustion chamber of a jet engine. It may also be useful to keep the elementary reactions and chemical dissociations for calculating emissions.</p>\n<h3>Real gas</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n21 April 1990 eruption of Mount Redoubt, Alaska, illustrating real gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Real gas</div>\n<p>Each one of the assumptions listed below adds to the complexity of the problem's solution. As the density of a gas increases with rising pressure, the intermolecular forces play a more substantial role in gas behavior which results in the ideal gas law no longer providing \"reasonable\" results. At the upper end of the engine temperature ranges (e.g. combustor sections – 1300 K), the complex fuel particles absorb internal energy by means of rotations and vibrations that cause their specific heats to vary from those of diatomic molecules and noble gases. At more than double that temperature, electronic excitation and dissociation of the gas particles begins to occur causing the pressure to adjust to a greater number of particles (transition from gas to plasma). Finally, all of the thermodynamic processes were presumed to describe uniform gases whose velocities varied according to a fixed distribution. Using a non-equilibrium situation implies the flow field must be characterized in some manner to enable a solution. One of the first attempts to expand the boundaries of the ideal gas law was to include coverage for different thermodynamic processes by adjusting the equation to read <i>pV = constant</i> and then varying the <i>n</i> through different values such as the specific heat ratio, <i>γ</i>.</p>\n<p><b>Real gas effects</b> include those adjustments made to account for a greater range of gas behavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compressibility effects (<i>Z</i> allowed to vary from 1.0)</li>\n<li>Variable heat capacity (specific heats vary with temperature)</li>\n<li>Van der Waals forces (related to compressibility, can substitute other equations of state)</li>\n<li>Non-equilibrium thermodynamic effects</li>\n<li>Issues with molecular dissociation and elementary reactions with variable composition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For most applications, such a detailed analysis is excessive. Examples where \"Real Gas effects\" would have a significant impact would be on the Space Shuttle re-entry where extremely high temperatures and pressures are present or the gases produced during geological events as in the image of the 1990 eruption of Mount Redoubt.</p>\n<h2>Historical synthesis</h2>\n<div>See also: Gas laws</div>\n<h3>Boyle's law</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBoyle's equipment.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Boyle's law</div>\n<p>Boyle's Law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state. In 1662 Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was carefully measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. The image of Boyle's Equipment shows some of the exotic tools used by Boyle during his study of gases.</p>\n<p>Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the pressure exerted by a gas held at a constant temperature varies inversely with the volume of the gas. For example, if the volume is halved, the pressure is doubled; and if the volume is doubled, the pressure is halved. Given the inverse relationship between pressure and volume, the product of pressure (<i>P</i>) and volume (<i>V</i>) is a constant (<i>k</i>) for a given mass of confined gas as long as the temperature is constant. Stated as a formula, thus is:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Because the before and after volumes and pressures of the fixed amount of gas, where the before and after temperatures are the same both equal the constant <i>k</i>, they can be related by the equation:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Charles's Law</h3>\n<div>Main article: Charles's law</div>\n<p>In 1787, the French physicist and balloon pioneer, Jacques Charles, found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to the same extent over the same 80 kelvin interval. He noted that, for an ideal gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its temperature:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Gay-Lussac's Law</h3>\n<div>Main article: Gay-Lussac's Law</div>\n<p>In 1802, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac published results of similar, though more extensive experiments. Gay-Lussac credited Charle's earlier work by naming the law in his honor. Gay-Lussac himself is credited with the law describing pressure, which he found in 1809. It states that the pressure exerted on a container's sides by an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Avogadro's law</h3>\n<div>Main article: Avogadro's law</div>\n<p>In 1811, Amedeo Avogadro verified that equal volumes of pure gases contain the same number of particles. His theory was not generally accepted until 1858 when another Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro was able to explain non-ideal exceptions. For his work with gases a century prior, the number that bears his name Avogadro's constant represents the number of atoms found in 12&nbsp;grams of elemental carbon-12 (6.022×10 mol). This specific number of gas particles, at standard temperature and pressure (ideal gas law) occupies 22.40 liters, which is referred to as the molar volume.</p>\n<p>Avogadro's law states that the volume occupied by an ideal gas is proportional to the number of moles (or molecules) present in the container. This gives rise to the molar volume of a gas, which at STP is 22.4 dm (or litres).

Mathematically, this can be represented for <i>n</i> species as:</p>\n<p><i><b>Pressure = Pressure + Pressure + ... + Pressure</b></i></p>\n<p>The image of Dalton's journal depicts symbology he used as shorthand to record the path he followed. Among his key journal observations upon mixing unreactive \"elastic fluids\" (gases) were the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike liquids, heavier gases did not drift to the bottom upon mixing.</li>\n<li>Gas particle identity played no role in determining final pressure (they behaved as if their size was negligible).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Special topics</h2>\n<h3>Compressibility</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCompressibility factors for air.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Compressibility factor</div>\n<p>Thermodynamicists use this factor (<i>Z</i>) to alter the ideal gas equation to account for compressibility effects of real gases. This factor represents the ratio of actual to ideal specific volumes. It is sometimes referred to as a \"fudge-factor\" or correction to expand the useful range of the ideal gas law for design purposes. <i>Usually</i> this <i>Z</i> value is very close to unity. The compressibility factor image illustrates how Z varies over a range of very cold temperatures.</p>\n<h3>Reynolds number</h3>\n<div>Main article: Reynolds number</div>\n<p>In fluid mechanics, the Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces (<i>vρ</i>) to viscous forces (<i>μ/L</i>). It is one of the most important dimensionless numbers in fluid dynamics and is used, usually along with other dimensionless numbers, to provide a criterion for determining dynamic similitude. As such, the Reynolds number provides the link between modeling results (design) and the full-scale actual conditions. It can also be used to characterize the flow.</p>\n<h3>Viscosity</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSatellite view of weather pattern in vicinity of Robinson Crusoe Islands on 15 September 1999, shows a unique turbulent cloud pattern called a Kármán vortex street</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Viscosity</div>\n<p>Viscosity, a physical property, is a measure of how well adjacent molecules stick to one another. A solid can withstand a shearing force due to the strength of these sticky intermolecular forces. A fluid will continuously deform when subjected to a similar load. While a gas has a lower value of viscosity than a liquid, it is still an observable property. If gases had no viscosity, then they would not stick to the surface of a wing and form a boundary layer. A study of the delta wing in the Schlieren image reveals that the gas particles stick to one another (see Boundary layer section).</p>\n<h3>Turbulence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDelta wing in wind tunnel. The shadows form as the indices of refraction change within the gas as it compresses on the leading edge of this wing.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Turbulence</div>\n<p>In fluid dynamics, <b>turbulence</b> or turbulent flow is a flow regime characterized by chaotic, stochastic property changes. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time. The Satellite view of weather around Robinson Crusoe Islands illustrates just one example.</p>\n<h3>Boundary layer</h3>\n<div>Main article: Boundary layer</div>\n<p>Particles will, in effect, \"stick\" to the surface of an object moving through it. This layer of particles is called the <b>boundary layer</b>. At the surface of the object, it is essentially static due to the friction of the surface. The object, with its boundary layer is effectively the new shape of the object that the rest of the molecules \"see\" as the object approaches. This boundary layer <i>can</i> separate from the surface, essentially creating a new surface and completely changing the flow path. The classical example of this is a stalling airfoil. The delta wing image clearly shows the boundary layer thickening as the gas flows from right to left along the leading edge.</p>\n<h3>Maximum entropy principle</h3>\n<div>Main article: Principle of maximum entropy</div>\n<p>As the total number of degrees of freedom approaches infinity, the system will be found in the macrostate that corresponds to the highest multiplicity. In order to illustrate this principle, observe the skin temperature of a frozen metal bar. Using a thermal image of the skin temperature, note the temperature distribution on the surface. This initial observation of temperature represents a \"microstate.\" At some future time, a second observation of the skin temperature produces a second microstate. By continuing this observation process, it is possible to produce a series of microstates that illustrate the thermal history of the bar's surface. Characterization of this historical series of microstates is possible by choosing the macrostate that successfully classifies them all into a single grouping.</p>\n<h3>Thermodynamic equilibrium</h3>\n<div>Main article: Thermodynamic equilibrium</div>\n<p>When energy transfer ceases from a system, this condition is referred to as thermodynamic equilibrium. Usually this condition implies the system and surroundings are at the same temperature so that heat no longer transfers between them. It also implies that external forces are balanced (volume does not change), and all chemical reactions within the system are complete. The timeline varies for these events depending on the system in question. A container of ice allowed to melt at room temperature takes hours, while in semiconductors the heat transfer that occurs in the device transition from an on to off state could be on the order of a few nanoseconds.</p>"

It was also the color worn by monks of the Franciscan order, Cistercian Order and the Capucine Order as a symbol of their vows of humility and poverty. Franciscan monks in England and Scotland were commonly known as the Grey friars, and that name is now attached to many places in Great Britain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, a Cistercian monk, wore robes of undyed grey wool.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Portrait of Saint Francis, the founder of the Franciscan Order, by El Greco. He also chose grey as the color of humility.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Renaissance and the Baroque</h3>\n<p>During the Renaissance and the Baroque, grey began to play an important role in fashion and art. Black became the most popular color of the nobility, particularly in Italy, France and Spain, and grey and white were harmonious with it.</p>\n<p>Grey was also frequently used for the drawing of oil paintings, a technique called grisaille. The painting would first be composed in grey and white, and then the colors, made with thin transparent glazes, would be added on top. The grisaille beneath would provide the shading, visible through the layers of color. Sometimes the grisaille was simply left uncovered, giving the appearance of carved stone.</p>\n<p>Grey was a particularly good background color for gold and for skin tones. It became the most common background for the portraits of Rembrandt Van Rijn and for many of the paintings of El Greco. who used it to highlight the faces and constumes of the central figures. The palette of Rembrandt was composed almost entirely of somber colors. He composed his warm greys out of black pigments made from charcoal or burnt animal bones, mixed with lead white or a white made of lime, which he warmed with a little red lake color from cochineal or madder. In one painting, the portrait of Margaretha de Geer (1661), one part of a grey wall in the background is painted with a layer of dark brown over a layer of orange, red, and yellow earths, mixed with ivory black and some lead white. Over this he put an additional layer of glaze made of mixture of blue smalt, red ochre, and yellow lake. Using these ingredients and many others, he made greys which had, according to art historian Philip Ball, \"an incredible subtlety of pigmentation.\". The warm, dark and rich greys and browns served to emphasize the golden light on the faces in the paintings. .</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The <i>Burial of the Count of Orgaz</i> (1588) by El Greco is a swirling carousel of greys.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Rembrandt Van Rijn self-portrait, 1629.

It looked particularly luminous coloring the silk and satin fabrics worn by the nobility and wealthy.</p>\n<p>Women's fashion in the 19th century was dominated by Paris, while men's fashion was set by London. The grey business suit appeared in the mid-19th century in London; light grey in summer, dark grey in winter; replacing the more colorful palette of men's clothing early in the century.</p>\n<p>The clothing of women working in the factories and workshops of Paris in the 19th century was usually grey. This gave them the name of <i>grisettes</i>. \"Gris\" or grey also meant drunk, and the name \"grisette\" was also given to the lower class of Parisian prostitutes.</p>\n<p>Grey also became a common color for military uniforms; in an age of rifles with longer range, soldiers in grey were less visible as targets than those in blue or red. Grey was the color of the uniforms of the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, and of the Prussian Army during the Franco-German War of 1870.</p>\n<p>Several artists of the mid-19th century used different tones of grey to create memorable paintings; Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot used tones of green-grey and blue grey to give harmony to his landscapes, and James McNeill Whistler created a special grey for the background of the portrait of his mother, and for his own self-portrait.</p>\n<p>Whistler's arrangement of different tones of grey had an effect on the world of music, on the French composer Claude Debussy. In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist Eugène Ysaÿe describing his <i>Nocturnes</i> as \"an experiment in the different combinations that can be obtained from one color – what a study in grey would be in painting.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Portrait of Captain Augustus Keppel (1752) by Sir Joshua Reynolds.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><i>Portrait of Charlotte Walsingham, Lady Fitzgerald</i> by John Hoppner (18th century).

Small, fluffy white clouds in summer look white because the sunlight is being scattered by the tiny water droplets they contain, and that white light comes to the viewer's eye. However, as clouds become larger and thicker, the white light cannot penetrate through the cloud, and is reflected off the top. Clouds look darkest grey during thunderstorms, when they can be as much as 20,000 to 30,000 feet high.</p>\n<p>Stratiform clouds are a layer of clouds that covers the entire sky, and which have a depth of between a few hundred to a few thousand feet thick. The thicker the clouds, the darker they appear from below, because little of the sunlight is able to pass through. From above, in an airplane, the same clouds look perfectly white, but from the ground the sky looks gloomy and grey.</p>\n<h3>The greying of hair</h3>\n<p>The color of a person's hair is created by the pigment melanin, found in the core of each hair. Melanin is also responsible for the color of the skin and of the eyes. There are only two types of pigment; dark (eumelanin) or light (phaeomelanin). Combined in various combinations, these pigments create all natural hair colors.</p>\n<p>Melanin itself is the product of a specialized cell, the melanocyte, which is found in each hair follicle, from which the hair grows. As hair grows, the melanocyte injects melanin into the hair cells, which contain the protein keratin and which makes up our hair, skin, and nails. As long as the melanocytes continue injecting melanin into the hair cells, the hair retains its original color. At a certain age, however, which varies from person to person, the amount of melanin injected is reduced and eventually stops. The hair, without pigment, turns grey and eventually white. The reason for this decline of production of melanocytes is uncertain. In the February 2005 issue of <i>Science</i>, a team of Harvard scientists suggested that the cause was the failure of the melanocyte stem cells to maintain the production of the essential pigments, due to age or genetic factors, after a certain period of time. For some people, the breakdown comes in their twenties; for others, many years later. According to the site of the magazine <i>Scientific American</i>, \"Generally speaking, among Caucasians 50 percent are 50 percent gray by age 50.\" Adult male gorillas also develop silver hair but only on their backs, see Physical characteristics of gorillas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Actor Donald Sutherland</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Optics of grey</h3>\n<p>Over the centuries, artists have traditionally created grey by mixing black and white in various proportions. They added a little red to make a warmer grey, or a little blue for a cooler grey. Artists could also make a grey by mixing two complementary colors, such orange and blue.</p>\n<p>Today the grey on televisions, computer displays and telephones is usually created using the RGB color model. Red, green, and blue light combined at full intensity on the black screen makes white; by lowering the intensity, it is possible to create different shades of grey.</p>\n<p>In printing, grey is usually obtained with the CMYK color model, using cyan, magenta, yellow and black. Grey is produced either by using black and white, or by combining equal amounts of cyan, magenta and yellow. Most greys have a cool or warm cast to them, as the human eye can detect even a minute amount of color saturation. Yellow, orange, and red create a \"warm grey\". Green, blue, and violet create a \"cool grey\". When no color is added, the color is \"neutral grey\", \"achromatic grey\" or simply \"grey\". Images consisting wholly of black, white and greys are called monochrome, black-and-white or greyscale.</p>\n\n<dl>\n<dt>RGB model</dt>\n<dd>Grey values result when <i>r</i> = <i>g</i> = <i>b</i>, for the color (<i>r</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>b</i>)</dd>\n<dt>CMYK model</dt>\n<dd>Grey values are produced by <i>c</i> = <i>m</i> = <i>y</i> = 0, for the color (<i>c</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>k</i>). Lightness is adjusted by varying <i>k</i>. In theory, any mixture where <i>c</i> = <i>m</i> = <i>y</i> is neutral, but in practice such mixtures are often a muddy brown (see discussion on this topic).</dd>\n<dt>HSL and HSV model&nbsp;</dt>\n<dd>Achromatic greys have no hue, so the <i>h</i> code is marked as \"undefined\" using a dash: <i>--</i>&nbsp;; greys also result whenever <i>s</i> is 0 or undefined, as is the case when <i>v</i> is 0 or <i>l</i> is 0 or 1</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<h3>Web colors</h3>\n<p>There are several tones of grey available for use with HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as named colors, while 254 true greys are available by specification of a hex triplet for the RGB value. All are spelled <i>gray</i>, using the spelling <i>grey</i> can cause errors. This spelling was inherited from the X11 color list. Internet Explorer's Trident browser engine does not recognize <i>grey</i> and renders it green. Another anomaly is that <i>gray</i> is in fact much darker than the X11 color marked <i>darkgray</i>; this is because of a conflict with the original HTML gray and the X11 gray, which is closer to HTML's <i>silver</i>. The three <i>slategray</i> colors are not themselves on the greyscale, but are slightly saturated towards cyan (green + blue). Since there are an even (256, including black and white) number of unsaturated tones of grey, there are two grey tones straddling the midpoint in the 8-bit greyscale. The color name <i>gray</i> has been assigned the lighter of the two shades (128, also known as #808080), due to rounding up.</p>\n<h3>Grey pigments</h3>\n<p>Until the 19th century, artists traditionally created grey by simply combining black and white. Rembrandt Van Rijn, for instance, usually used lead white and either carbon black or ivory black, along with touches of either blues or reds to cool or warm the grey.</p>\n<p>In the early 19th century, a new grey, Payne's grey, appeared on the market. Payne's grey is a dark blue-grey, a mixture of ultramarine and black or of ultramarine and Sienna. It is named after William Payne, a British artist who painted watercolors in the late 18th century. The first recorded use of <i>Payne’s grey</i> as a color name in English was in 1835.</p>\n<h3>Animal color</h3>\n<p>Grey is a very common color for animals, birds and fish, ranging in size from whales to mice. It provides a natural camouflage and allows them to blend with their surroundings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>A grey whale travels as much as 11,000 kilometers annually between its breeding waters in the Gulf of California and its feeding grounds in the Bering Sea.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The grey wolf (canis lupus) is the largest wild member of the <i>Canidae</i> family.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The African elephant is the largest land animal.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The grey heron is a large bird found in Europe, Asia and Africa. A large colony of grey herons lives in the center of Amsterdam.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Grey matter of the brain</h3>\n<p>The substance that composes the brain is sometimes referred to as grey matter, or \"the little grey cells\", so the color grey is associated with things intellectual. However, the living human brain is actually pink in color; it only turns grey when dead.</p>\n<h3>Nanotechnology and grey goo</h3>\n<p>Grey goo is to a hypothetical end-of-the-world scenario, also known as ecophagy: out-of-control self-replicating nanobots consume all living matter on Earth while building more of themselves.</p>\n<h3>Grey noise</h3>\n<p>In sound engineering, grey noise is random noise subjected to a psychoacoustic equal loudness curve, such as an <i>inverted</i> A-weighting curve, over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies.</p>\n<h2>Grey in culture</h2>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>In the Christian religion, grey is the color of ashes, and so a biblical symbol of mourning and repentance, described as sackcloth and ashes. It can be used during Lent or on special days of fasting and prayer. As the color of humility and modesty, grey is worn by monks of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, Franciscan order and Cistercian order.</p>\n<p>Buddhist monks and priests in Japan and Korea will often wear a sleeved grey, brown, or black outer robe.</p>\n<p>Taoist priests in China also often wear grey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>A Franciscan monk in Israel</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Young Buddhist monks in Korea.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Taoist priest in Wudang, China</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Politics</h3>\n<p>Grey is rarely used as a color by political parties, largely because of its common association with conformity, boredom and indecision.</p>\n<p>The term \"grey power\" or \"the grey vote\" is sometimes used to describe the influence of older voters as a voting bloc. In the United States, older people are more likely to vote, and usually vote to protect certain social benefits, such as Social Security.</p>\n<p><i>Greys</i> is a term sometimes used pejoratively by environmentalists in the green movement to describe those who oppose environmental measures and supposedly prefer the grey of concrete and cement.</p>\n<h3>The grey uniform</h3>\n<p>During the American Civil War, the soldiers of the Confederate Army wore grey uniforms. At the beginning of the war, The armies of the North and of the South had very similar uniforms; some Confederate units wore blue, and some Union units wore grey. There naturally was confusion, and sometimes soldiers fired by mistake at soldiers of their own army. On June 6, 1861, the Confederate government issued regulations standarizing the army uniform and establishing cadet grey as the uniform color. This was (and still is) the color of the uniform of cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and cadets at the Virginia Military Institute, which produced many officers for the Confederacy.</p>\n<p>The new uniforms were designed by Nicola Marschall, a German-American artist, who also designed the original Confederate flag. He closely followed the design of contemporary French and Austrian military uniforms. Grey was not chosen for its camouflage value; this was not appreciated for several more decades; but because the South did not have a major dye industry and grey dyes were inexpensive and easy to manufacture. While some units had uniforms colored with good-quality dyes, which were a solid bluish-grey, others had uniforms colored with vegetable dyes made from sumac or logwood, which quickly faded in sunshine to the yellowish color of butternut squash.</p>\n<p>In the last twelve months of the war, the South was able to import uniforms made with good-quality blue-grey dye from Ireland, made especially for the Confederacy by a firm in Limerick, but by that time the war was on its way to being lost.</p>\n<p>The German Army, or <i>Wehrmacht</i>, wore grey uniforms from 1907 until 1945, during both the First World War and Second World War. The color chosen was a grey-green called field grey, or <i>feldgrau</i>, It was chosen because it was less visible at a distance than the previous German uniforms, which were Prussian blue. It was one of the first uniform colors to be chosen for its camouflage value, important in the new age of smokeless powder and more accurate rifles and machine guns. It gave the Germans a distinct advantage at the beginning of the First World War, when the French soldiers were dressed in blue jackets and red trousers.</p>\n<p>During World War II, most German soldiers wore the traditional field grey. The soldiers of the Afrika Korps of General Erwin Rommel wore a lighter grey uniform more suitable for the desert.</p>\n<p>Some of the more recent uniforms of the German Army and East German Army were field grey, as were some uniforms of the Swedish army. The Army of Chile wears field grey today.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Confederate General Stonewall Jackson at the Battle of Chancellorsville (1863).

The intent of a business suit was above all to show seriousness, and to show one's position in business and society. Over the course of the century, bright colors disappeared from men's fashion, and were largely replaced by a black or dark charcoal grey frock coat in winter, and lighter greys in summer. In the early 20th century, the frock coat was gradually replaced by the lounge suit, a less formal version of evening dress, which was also usually black or charcoal grey, In the 1930s the English suit style was called the drape suit, with wide shoulders and a nipped waist, usually dark or light grey. After World War II, the style changed to a slimmer fit called the continental cut, but the color remained grey.</p>\n<p>By the second half of the 20th century, men's fashions in suits were determined as much by Hollywood as by London tailors. The 1950s and 1960s were the age of glory for the grey suit; they were worn by movie stars, such as Cary Grant and Humphrey Bogart, and by President John F. Kennedy, who wore a two-button grey suit. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson was the first U.S. president to be inaugurated wearing an Oxford grey business suit; his predecessors had worn a formal cutaway coat with striped trousers for their inaugurations. Grey suits also became the unofficial uniform of Madison Avenue in New York City, the center of the advertising industry. This style is satirized in the recent U.S. television series Mad Men.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the 21st century, the style was beginning to change; grey was considered monotonous and without character. Gradually the dark blue suit gained supremacy. At recent meetings of the G-20 and other international organizations, nearly every head of state of the world was wearing a blue business suit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>William Holden and Humphrey Bogart in grey business suits in the 1954 film Sabrina.

Scandinavian folklore often depicts gnomes and nisser in grey clothing. This is partly because of their association with dusk, as well as because these creatures were said to be outside traditional moral standards of black and white.</p>\n<p>The writer J. R. R. Tolkien made use of this folkloric symbolism of grey in his works, which often draw upon Scandinavian folkloric names and themes. Gandalf is called the Grey Pilgrim; settings include the Grey Havensay and Ered Mithrin, the grey mountains; and characters include the Grey Elves.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Illustration of goblins by Goya</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sports</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In baseball, grey is the color typically used for road uniforms. This came about because in the 19th and early 20th century, away teams didn't normally have access to laundry facilities on the road, thus stains were not noticeable on the darker grey uniforms as opposed to the white uniforms worn by the home team.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Parapsychology</h3>\n<p>Believers in parapsychology say that those who are suffering from the mental illness of depression have grey auras.</p>\n<h3>Gay culture</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In gay slang, a <i>grey queen</i> is a gay person who works for the financial services industry (this term originates from the fact that in the 1950s, people who worked in this profession often wore grey flannel suits).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Associations and symbolism</h2>\n<p>In America and Europe, grey is one of the least popular colors; In a European survey, only one percent of men said it was their favorite color, and thirteen percent called it their least favorite color; the response from women was almost the same. According to color historian Eva Heller, \"grey is too weak to be considered masculine, but too menacing to be considered a feminine color. It is neither warm nor cold, neither material or spiritual. With grey, nothing seems to be decided.\" </p>\n<h3>Conformity</h3>\n<p>Grey is the color of conformity- not having any personality of its own, it adapts to any other color. It will look either dark or light, depending upon the color next to it.</p>\n<h3>Boredom</h3>\n<p>In Europe and America, grey is the color most associated with boredom, solitude and emptiness. It is associated with rainy days and winter. In the novel <i>Faust</i> by Goethe, the hero is pursued by four \"grey women\"; pain, necessity, guilt and misery, who follow him until his death.</p>\n<h3>Reflection and uncertainty</h3>\n<p>One of the rare positive associations of grey is with mental power and reflection; with the brain. In the novels by Agatha Christie, the detective Hercule Poirot refers frequently to the \"little grey cells\" of his brain which help him solve mysteries. Grey and blue, when put next to each other, have a positive association of reflection, while grey white and blue put together are associated with science.</p>\n<p>Grey is also the color most associated with uncertainty; a \"grey area\" is a subject covered by a law or policy where there is lack of clarity.</p>\n<h3>Shadows and secrecy</h3>\n<p>Grey is commonly associated with secrecy and shadows. An eminence grise in politics is a person who controls and manipulates people in power in a sinister way without his role being known to the public.The phrase originated as a description of François Leclerc du Tremblay, the French monk who served as advisor to Cardinal de Richelieu.</p>\n<h3>Old Age</h3>\n<p>Grey is the color most commonly associated in many cultures with the elderly and old age, because of the association with grey hair; it symbolizes the wisdom and dignity that come with experience and age. The New York Times is sometimes called <i>The Grey Lady</i> because of its long history and esteemed position in American journalism.</p>\n<h3>Poverty and modesty</h3>\n<p>Grey is the color most often associated in Europe and America with modesty. As the color of undyed wool, it was the color worn by peasants and the poor, and was reputed to be the color of the clothing of Jesus Christ, and for that reason is the color worn by monks of the Cistercian and Franciscan orders. As the color of modesty, it is also associated with fairy tales; the character Cinderella takes her name from the color of cinders or ashes. Hers is the story of a poor virtuous woman who suffers humiliations from those above her until she meets her prince. Griselda or Griseldis, a similar character with a name taken from the color grey, known for her patience despite her suffering, exists in Italian, French German folklore, and in Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>.</p>"

  "title": "Helium",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Helium (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Helium</b> is a chemical element with symbol <b>He</b> and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas that heads the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions.</p>\n<p>Helium is the second lightest element and is the second most abundant element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, and is believed to have been formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.</p>\n<p>Helium is named for the Greek God of the Sun, Helios. It was first detected as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse in 1868 by French astronomer Jules Janssen. Janssen is jointly credited with detecting the element along with Norman Lockyer. Jannsen observed during the solar eclipse of 1868 while Lockyer observed from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element, which he named. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by two Swedish chemists, Per Teodor Cleve and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite. In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas today.</p>\n<p>Helium is used in cryogenics (its largest single use, absorbing about a quarter of production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas with differing density from air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (helium&nbsp;I and helium&nbsp;II), is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, that temperatures near absolute zero produce in matter.</p>\n<p>On Earth it is relatively rare—0.00052% by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations up to 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Scientific discoveries</h3>\n<p>The first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868 as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49&nbsp;nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D Fraunhofer line because it was near the known D and D lines of sodium. He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (<i>helios</i>).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSpectral lines of helium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 1882, Italian physicist Luigi Palmieri detected helium on Earth, for the first time, through its D spectral line, when he analyzed the lava of Mount Vesuvius.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSir William Ramsay, the discoverer of terrestrial helium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth by treating the mineral cleveite (a variety of uraninite with at least 10% rare earth elements) with mineral acids. Ramsay was looking for argon but, after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated by sulfuric acid, he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D line observed in the spectrum of the Sun. These samples were identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes. It was independently isolated from cleveite in the same year by chemists Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet in Uppsala, Sweden, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight. Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist William Francis Hillebrand prior to Ramsay's discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen. His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near-discovery in science.</p>\n<p>In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds demonstrated that alpha particles are helium nuclei by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectra of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not have a triple point temperature at which the solid, liquid, and gas phases are at equilibrium. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1&nbsp;cm of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.</p>\n<p>In 1938, Russian physicist Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa discovered that helium-4 has almost no viscosity at temperatures near absolute zero, a phenomenon now called superfluidity. This phenomenon is related to Bose-Einstein condensation. In 1972, the same phenomenon was observed in helium-3, but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero, by American physicists Douglas D. Osheroff, David M. Lee, and Robert C. Richardson. The phenomenon in helium-3 is thought to be related to pairing of helium-3 fermions to make bosons, in analogy to Cooper pairs of electrons producing superconductivity.</p>\n<h3>Extraction and use</h3>\n<p>After an oil drilling operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.</p>\n<p>This enabled the United States to become the world's leading supplier of helium. Following a suggestion by Sir Richard Threlfall, the United States Navy sponsored three small experimental helium plants during World War I. The goal was to supply barrage balloons with the non-flammable, lighter-than-air gas. A total of 5,700&nbsp;m (200,000 cubic feet) of 92% helium was produced in the program even though less than a cubic meter of the gas had previously been obtained. Some of this gas was used in the world's first helium-filled airship, the U.S. Navy's C-7, which flew its maiden voyage from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Bolling Field in Washington, D.C., on December 1, 1921.</p>\n<p>Although the extraction process, using low-temperature gas liquefaction, was not developed in time to be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft. This use increased demand during World War II, as well as demands for shielded arc welding. The helium mass spectrometer was also vital in the atomic bomb Manhattan Project.</p>\n<p>The government of the United States set up the National Helium Reserve in 1925 at Amarillo, Texas, with the goal of supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime. Because of a US military embargo against Germany that restricted helium supplies, the Hindenburg, like all German Zeppelins, was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas. Helium use following World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel (among other uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.</p>\n<p>After the \"Helium Acts Amendments of 1960\" (Public Law 86–777), the U.S. Bureau of Mines arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas. For this <i>helium conservation</i> program, the Bureau built a 425-mile (684&nbsp;km) pipeline from Bushton, Kansas, to connect those plants with the government's partially depleted Cliffside gas field, near Amarillo, Texas. This helium-nitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the Cliffside gas field until needed, when it then was further purified.</p>\n<p>By 1995, a billion cubic meters of the gas had been collected and the reserve was US$1.4&nbsp;billion in debt, prompting the Congress of the United States in 1996 to phase out the reserve. The resulting \"Helium Privatization Act of 1996\" (Public Law 104–273) directed the United States Department of the Interior to empty the reserve, with sales starting by 2005.</p>\n<p>Helium produced between 1930 and 1945 was about 98.3% pure (2% nitrogen), which was adequate for airships. In 1945, a small amount of 99.9% helium was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% helium were available.</p>\n<p>For many years the United States produced over 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing 17&nbsp;million cubic meters (600&nbsp;million cubic feet) began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to above 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, two additional plants, one in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and the other in Skikda, Algeria, were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption and the costs of producing helium increased. In the 2002 to 2007 period helium prices doubled.</p>\n<p>As of 2012 the United States National Helium Reserve accounted for 30 percent of the world's helium. The reserve was expected to run out of helium in 2018. Despite that a proposed bill in the United States Senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia and the United States state of Wyoming but they were not expected to ease the shortage.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>The helium atom</h3>\n<div>Main article: Helium atom</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<b>The helium atom.</b> Depicted are the nucleus (pink) and the electron cloud distribution (black). The nucleus (upper right) in helium-4 is in reality spherically symmetric and closely resembles the electron cloud, although for more complicated nuclei this is not always the case.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Helium in quantum mechanics</h4>\n<p>In the perspective of quantum mechanics, helium is the second simplest atom to model, following the hydrogen atom. Helium is composed of two electrons in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons along with some neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system consisting of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach (see 3-body problem) and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons. Such computational chemistry methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within &lt; 2% of the correct value, in a few computational steps. In such models it is found that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge <i>Z</i> which each electron sees, is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a classic \"bare\" helium nucleus.</p>\n<h4>The related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell</h4>\n<p>The nucleus of the helium-4 atom is identical with an alpha particle. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy <b>1s</b> orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.</p>\n<p>For example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.</p>\n<p>In a similar way, the particular energetic stability of the helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions involving both heavy-particle emission, and fusion. Some stable helium-3 is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, but it is a very small fraction, compared with the highly favorable helium-4. The stability of helium-4 is the reason hydrogen is converted to helium-4 (not deuterium or helium-3 or heavier elements) in the Sun. It is also partly responsible for the fact that the alpha particle is by far the most common type of baryonic particle to be ejected from atomic nuclei; in other words, alpha decay is far more common than cluster decay.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBinding energy per nucleon of common isotopes. The binding energy per particle of helium-4 is significantly larger than all nearby nuclides.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically: it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, as the \"soup\" of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. So tight was helium-4 binding that helium-4 production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) and thus no energetic drive was available, once helium had been formed, to make elements 3, 4 and 5. It was barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon, carbon. However, due to lack of intermediate elements, this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see triple alpha process). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.</p>\n<p>All heavier elements (including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass of atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.</p>\n<h3>Gas and plasma phases</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHelium discharge tube shaped like the element's atomic symbol</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Helium is the second least reactive noble gas, after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For similar reasons, and also due to the small size of helium atoms, helium's diffusion rate through solids is three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.</p>\n<p>Helium is the least water soluble monatomic gas, and one of the least water soluble of any gas (CF, SF, and CF have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x/10, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x/10), and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule-Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule-Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50&nbsp;K at 1&nbsp;atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.</p>\n<p>Most extraterrestrial helium is found in a plasma state, with properties quite different from those of atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.</p>\n<h3>Solid, liquid, and superfluid phases</h3>\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLiquefied helium. This helium is not only liquid, but has been cooled to the point of superfluidity. The drop of liquid at the bottom of the glass represents helium spontaneously escaping from the container over the side, to empty out of the container. The energy to drive this process is supplied by the potential energy of the falling helium. See superfluid.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Liquid helium</div>\n<p>Unlike any other element, helium will remain liquid down to absolute zero at normal pressures. This is a direct effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy of the system is too high to allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5&nbsp;K (about −272&nbsp;°C or −457&nbsp;°F) and about 25&nbsp;bar (2.5&nbsp;MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.006&nbsp;g/cm at 1.15&nbsp;K and 66&nbsp;atm; the projected density at 0&nbsp;K and 25&nbsp;bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.009&nbsp;g/cm.</p>\n<h4>Helium I state</h4>\n<p>Below its boiling point of 4.22&nbsp;kelvins and above the lambda point of 2.1768&nbsp;kelvins, the isotope helium-4 exists in a normal colorless liquid state, called <i>helium&nbsp;I</i>. Like other cryogenic liquids, helium&nbsp;I boils when it is heated and contracts when its temperature is lowered. Below the lambda point, however, helium does not boil, and it expands as the temperature is lowered further.</p>\n<p>Helium&nbsp;I has a gas-like index of refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both types of liquid helium are called <i>quantum fluids</i>, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.</p>\n<h4>Helium II state</h4>\n<p>Liquid helium below its lambda point begins to exhibit very unusual characteristics, in a state called <i>helium&nbsp;II</i>. When helium&nbsp;II boils, due to its high thermal conductivity it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface. Helium-3 also has a superfluid phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less is known about such properties in the isotope.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUnlike ordinary liquids, helium&nbsp;II will creep along surfaces in order to reach an equal level; after a short while, the levels in the two containers will equalize. The Rollin film also covers the interior of the larger container; if it were not sealed, the helium&nbsp;II would creep out and escape.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Helium&nbsp;II is a superfluid, a quantum mechanical state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties . For example, when it flows through capillaries as thin as 10 to 10&nbsp;m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the <i>two-fluid model</i> for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.</p>\n<p>In the <i>fountain effect</i>, a chamber is constructed which is connected to a reservoir of helium&nbsp;II by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If the interior of the container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.</p>\n<p>The thermal conductivity of helium&nbsp;II is greater than that of any other known substance, a million times that of helium&nbsp;I and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. Helium&nbsp;II has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20&nbsp;meters per second at 1.8&nbsp;K through helium&nbsp;II as waves in a phenomenon known as <i>second sound</i>.</p>\n<p>Helium&nbsp;II also exhibits a creeping effect. When a surface extends past the level of helium&nbsp;II, the helium&nbsp;II moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. Helium&nbsp;II will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30&nbsp;nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As a result of this creeping behavior and helium&nbsp;II's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, it is very difficult to confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the helium&nbsp;II will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as <i>third sound</i>.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of helium</div>\n<p>There are eight known isotopes of helium, but only helium-3 and helium-4 are stable. In the Earth's atmosphere, there is one 3He atom for every million 4He atoms. Unlike most elements, helium's isotopic abundance varies greatly by origin, due to the different formation processes. The most common isotope, helium-4, is produced on Earth by alpha decay of heavier radioactive elements; the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized helium-4 nuclei. Helium-4 is an unusually stable nucleus because its nucleons are arranged into complete shells. It was also formed in enormous quantities during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.</p>\n<p>Helium-3 is present on Earth only in trace amounts; most of it since Earth's formation, though some falls to Earth trapped in cosmic dust. Trace amounts are also produced by the beta decay of tritium. Rocks from the Earth's crust have isotope ratios varying by as much as a factor of ten, and these ratios can be used to investigate the origin of rocks and the composition of the Earth's mantle. 3He is much more abundant in stars, as a product of nuclear fusion. Thus in the interstellar medium, the proportion of 3He to 4He is around 100 times higher than on Earth. Extraplanetary material, such as lunar and asteroid regolith, have trace amounts of helium-3 from being bombarded by solar winds. The Moon's surface contains helium-3 at concentrations on the order of 0.01&nbsp;ppm, much higher than the ca. 5 ppt found in the Earth's atmosphere. A number of people, starting with Gerald Kulcinski in 1986, have proposed to explore the moon, mine lunar regolith and use the helium-3 for fusion.</p>\n<p>Liquid helium-4 can be cooled to about 1&nbsp;kelvin using evaporative cooling in a 1-K pot. Similar cooling of helium-3, which has a lower boiling point, can achieve about 0.2&nbsp;kelvin in a helium-3 refrigerator. Equal mixtures of liquid 3He and 4He below 0.8&nbsp;K separate into two immiscible phases due to their dissimilarity (they follow different quantum statistics: helium-4 atoms are bosons while helium-3 atoms are fermions). Dilution refrigerators use this immiscibility to achieve temperatures of a few millikelvins.</p>\n<p>It is possible to produce exotic helium isotopes, which rapidly decay into other substances. The shortest-lived heavy helium isotope is helium-5 with a half-life of 7.6×10&nbsp;s. Helium-6 decays by emitting a beta particle and has a half-life of 0.8&nbsp;second. Helium-7 also emits a beta particle as well as a gamma ray. Helium-7 and helium-8 are created in certain nuclear reactions. Helium-6 and helium-8 are known to exhibit a nuclear halo.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also: Noble gas compound</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of the helium hydride ion, HHe.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of the suspected fluoroheliate anion, OHeF.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Helium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions. It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As with the other noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential. Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge, to electron bombardment, or else is a plasma for another reason. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe, and WHe, and the molecular ions He+\n2, He2+\n2, HeH+, and HeD+ have been created this way. HeH is also stable in its ground state, but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it comes into contact with. This technique has also allowed the production of the neutral molecule He, which has a large number of band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently held together only by polarization forces. Theoretically, other true compounds may also be possible, such as helium fluorohydride (HHeF) which would be analogous to HArF, discovered in 2000. Calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen bond could be stable. Two new molecular species, predicted using theory, CsFHeO and N(CH)FHeO, are derivatives of a metastable [F– HeO] anion first theorized in 2005 by a group from Taiwan. If confirmed by experiment, the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon.</p>\n<p>Helium has been put inside the hollow carbon cage molecules (the fullerenes) by heating under high pressure. The endohedral fullerene molecules formed are stable up to high temperatures. When chemical derivatives of these fullerenes are formed, the helium stays inside. If helium-3 is used, it can be readily observed by helium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Many fullerenes containing helium-3 have been reported. Although the helium atoms are not attached by covalent or ionic bonds, these substances have distinct properties and a definite composition, like all stoichiometric chemical compounds.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<h3>Natural abundance</h3>\n<p>Although it is rare on Earth, Helium is the second most abundant element in the known Universe (after hydrogen), constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton-proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.</p>\n<p>In the Earth's atmosphere, the concentration of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million. The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes. In the Earth's heterosphere, a part of the upper atmosphere, helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.</p>\n<p>Most helium on Earth is a result of radioactive decay. Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including cleveite, pitchblende, carnotite and monazite, because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000&nbsp;metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere. In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. The concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm up to over 7% in a small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.</p>\n<h3>Modern extraction and distribution</h3>\n<p>For large-scale use, helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain up to 7% helium. Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which almost all of the remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.</p>\n<p>In 2008, approximately 169 million standard cubic meters (SCM) of helium were extracted from natural gas or withdrawn from helium reserves with approximately 78% from the United States, 10% from Algeria, and most of the remainder from Russia, Poland and Qatar. In the United States, most helium is extracted from natural gas of the Hugoton and nearby gas fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Much of this gas was once sent by pipeline to the National Helium Reserve, but since 2005 this reserve is presently being depleted and sold off.</p>\n<p>Diffusion of crude natural gas through special semipermeable membranes and other barriers is another method to recover and purify helium. In 1996, the U.S. had <i>proven</i> helium reserves, in such gas well complexes, of about 147 billion standard cubic feet (4.2 billion SCM). At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM per year in the U.S.; see pie chart below) this is enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers. It is estimated that the resource base for <i>yet-unproven</i> helium in natural gas in the U.S. is 31–53 trillion SCM, about 1000 times the proven reserves.</p>\n<p>Helium must be extracted from natural gas because it is present in air at only a fraction of that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, that 0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants. Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, but this process is a completely uneconomic method of production.</p>\n<p>Helium is commercially available in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, it can be supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold up to 1,000&nbsp;liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42&nbsp;m (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding up to 8 m (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities of up to 4,860 m (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).</p>\n<h3>Conservation advocates</h3>\n<p>According to helium conservationists like Robert Coleman Richardson, the free market price of helium has contributed to \"wasteful\" usage (e.g. for helium balloons). Prices in the 2000s have been lowered by U.S. Congress' decision to sell off the country's large helium stockpile by 2015. According to Richardson, the current price needs to be multiplied by 20 to eliminate the excessive wasting of helium. In their book, the <i>Future of helium as a natural resource</i> (Routledge, 2012), Nuttall, Clarke &amp; Glowacki (2012) also proposed to create an International Helium Agency (IHA) to build a sustainable market for this precious commodity.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe largest single use of liquid helium is to cool the superconducting magnets in modern MRI scanners.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEstimated U.S. fractional helium use by category, by the United States Geological Survey, in 1996. Most of the cryogenic use is for superconducting MRI magnets.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>While balloons are perhaps the most well-known use of helium, they are a minor part of all helium use. Helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties, such as its low boiling point, low density, low solubility, high thermal conductivity, or inertness. Of the 2008 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (193 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 22% of the total in 2008) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners. Other major uses (totalling to about 78% of use in 1996) were pressurizing and purging systems, maintenance of controlled atmospheres, and welding. Other uses by category were relatively minor fractions.</p>\n<h3>Controlled atmospheres</h3>\n<p>Helium is used as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography, because it is inert. Because of its inertness, thermally and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities.</p>\n<h3>Gas tungsten arc welding</h3>\n<div>Main article: gas tungsten arc welding</div>\n<p>Helium is used as a shielding gas in arc welding processes on materials that at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by air or nitrogen. A number of inert shielding gases are used in gas tungsten arc welding, but helium is used instead of cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity, like aluminium or copper.</p>\n<h3>Minor uses</h3>\n<h4>Industrial leak detection</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA dual chamber helium leak detection machine</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>One industrial application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three times faster than air, it is used as a tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10 mbar·L/s (10 Pa·m/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.</p>\n<p>Helium leaks through cracks should not be confused with gas permeation through a bulk material. While helium has documented permeation constants (thus a calculable permeation rate) through glasses, ceramics, and synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals.</p>\n<h4>Flight</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBecause of its low density and incombustibility, helium is the gas of choice to fill airships such as the Goodyear blimp.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Because it is lighter than air, airships and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is approximately 7% more buoyant, helium has the advantage of being non-flammable (in addition to being fire retardant). Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V booster used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000&nbsp;m (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.</p>\n<h4>Minor commercial and recreational uses</h4>\n<p>For its low solubility in nervous tissue, helium mixtures such as trimix, heliox and heliair are used for deep diving to reduce the effects of narcosis. At depths below 150 metres (490&nbsp;ft) small amounts of hydrogen are added to a helium-oxygen mixture to counter the effects of high-pressure nervous syndrome. At these depths the low density of helium is found to considerably reduce the effort of breathing.</p>\n<p>Helium-neon lasers, a type of low-powered gas laser producing a red beam, had various practical applications which included barcode readers and laser pointers, before they were almost universally replaced by cheaper diode lasers.</p>\n<p>For its inertness and high thermal conductivity, neutron transparency, and because it does not form radioactive isotopes under reactor conditions, helium is used as a heat-transfer medium in some gas-cooled nuclear reactors.</p>\n<p>Helium, mixed with a heavier gas such as xenon, is useful for thermoacoustic refrigeration due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low Prandtl number. The inertness of helium has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming.</p>\n<h4>Scientific uses</h4>\n<p>The use of helium reduces the distorting effects of temperature variations in the space between lenses in some telescopes, due to its extremely low index of refraction. This method is especially used in solar telescopes where a vacuum tight telescope tube would be too heavy.</p>\n<p>Helium is a commonly used carrier gas for gas chromatography.</p>\n<p>The age of rocks and minerals that contain uranium and thorium can be estimated by measuring the level of helium with a process known as helium dating.</p>\n<p>Helium at low temperatures is used in cryogenics, and in certain cryogenics applications. As examples of applications, liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely low temperatures required for superconductivity, such as in superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN uses 96&nbsp;metric tons of liquid helium to maintain the temperature at 1.9&nbsp;kelvin.</p>\n<h2>Inhalation and safety</h2>\n<p>Neutral helium at standard conditions is non-toxic, plays no biological role and is found in trace amounts in human blood.</p>\n\n<p>The speed of sound in helium is nearly three times the speed of sound in air. Because the fundamental frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to the speed of sound in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.</p>\n<p>Inhaling helium can be dangerous if done to excess, since helium is a simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration. Breathing pure helium continuously causes death by asphyxiation within minutes. This fact is utilized in the design of suicide bags.</p>\n<p>Inhaling helium directly from pressurized cylinders is extremely dangerous, as the high flow rate can result in barotrauma, fatally rupturing lung tissue. However, death caused by helium is rare, with only two fatalities reported between 2000 and 2004 in the United States. However, there were two cases in 2010, one in the USA in January and another in Northern Ireland in November. An Oregon girl died in 2012 from barotrauma, and an another girl from hypoxia later in the year.</p>\n<p>The safety issues for cryogenic helium are similar to those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed to room temperature.</p>\n<p>At high pressures (more than about 20&nbsp;atm or two&nbsp;MPa), a mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox) can lead to high-pressure nervous syndrome, a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding a small amount of nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.</p>\n"

  "html": "\n<p>The <b>noble gases</b> make a group of chemical elements with similar properties: under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity. The six noble gases that occur naturally are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn).</p>\n<p>For the first six periods of the periodic table, the noble gases are exactly the members of <b>group&nbsp;18</b> of the periodic table. It is possible that due to relativistic effects, the group 14 element flerovium exhibits some noble-gas-like properties, instead of the group 18 element ununoctium.</p>\n<p>The properties of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of atomic structure: their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be \"full\", giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions, and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred noble gas compounds. The melting and boiling points for a given noble gas are close together, differing by less than 10 °C (18&nbsp;°F); that is, they are liquids over only a small temperature range.</p>\n<p>Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from air in an air separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation. Helium is sourced from natural gas fields which have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas, using cryogenic gas separation techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium compounds. Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A helium-oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over 55&nbsp;m (180&nbsp;ft) to keep the diver from experiencing oxygen toxemia, the lethal effect of high-pressure oxygen, and nitrogen narcosis, the distracting narcotic effect of the nitrogen in air beyond this partial-pressure threshold. After the risks caused by the flammability of hydrogen became apparent, it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p><i>Noble gas</i> is translated from the German noun Edelgas, first used in 1898 by Hugo Erdmann to indicate their extremely low level of reactivity. The name makes an analogy to the term \"noble metals\", which also have low reactivity. The noble gases have also been referred to as <i>inert gases</i>, but this label is deprecated as many noble gas compounds are now known. <i>Rare gases</i> is another term that was used, but this is also inaccurate because argon forms a fairly considerable part (0.94% by volume, 1.3% by mass) of the Earth's atmosphere.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHelium was first detected in the Sun due to its characteristic spectral lines.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Pierre Janssen and Joseph Norman Lockyer discovered a new element on August 18, 1868 while looking at the chromosphere of the Sun, and named it helium after the Greek word for the Sun, ήλιος (<i>ílios</i> or <i>helios</i>). No chemical analysis was possible at the time, but helium was later found to be a noble gas. Before them, in 1784, the English chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish had discovered that air contains a small proportion of a substance less reactive than nitrogen. A century later, in 1895, Lord Rayleigh discovered that samples of nitrogen from the air were of a different density than nitrogen resulting from chemical reactions. Along with Scottish scientist William Ramsay at University College, London, Lord Rayleigh theorized that the nitrogen extracted from air was mixed with another gas, leading to an experiment that successfully isolated a new element, argon, from the Greek word αργός (<i>argós</i>, \"inactive\"). With this discovery, they realized an entire class of gases was missing from the periodic table. During his search for argon, Ramsay also managed to isolate helium for the first time while heating cleveite, a mineral. In 1902, having accepted the evidence for the elements helium and argon, Dmitri Mendeleev included these noble gases as group&nbsp;0 in his arrangement of the elements, which would later become the periodic table.</p>\n<p>Ramsay continued to search for these gases using the method of fractional distillation to separate liquid air into several components. In 1898, he discovered the elements krypton, neon, and xenon, and named them after the Greek words κρυπτός (<i>kryptós</i>, \"hidden\"), νέος (<i>néos</i>, \"new\"), and ξένος (<i>xénos</i>, \"stranger\"), respectively. Radon was first identified in 1898 by Friedrich Ernst Dorn, and was named <i>radium emanation</i>, but was not considered a noble gas until 1904 when its characteristics were found to be similar to those of other noble gases. Rayleigh and Ramsay received the 1904 Nobel Prizes in Physics and in Chemistry, respectively, for their discovery of the noble gases; in the words of J. E. Cederblom, then president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, \"the discovery of an entirely new group of elements, of which no single representative had been known with any certainty, is something utterly unique in the history of chemistry, being intrinsically an advance in science of peculiar significance\".</p>\n<p>The discovery of the noble gases aided in the development of a general understanding of atomic structure. In 1895, French chemist Henri Moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine, the most electronegative element, and argon, one of the noble gases, but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure. Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed in 1913 that the electrons in atoms are arranged in shells surrounding the nucleus, and that for all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons. In 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis formulated the <i>octet rule</i>, which concluded an octet of electrons in the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom; this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell.</p>\n<p>In 1962 Neil Bartlett discovered the first chemical compound of a noble gas, xenon hexafluoroplatinate. Compounds of other noble gases were discovered soon after: in 1962 for radon, radon difluoride, and in 1963 for krypton, krypton difluoride (KrF\n2). The first stable compound of argon was reported in 2000 when argon fluorohydride (HArF) was formed at a temperature of 40 K (−233.2&nbsp;°C; −387.7&nbsp;°F).</p>\n<p>In December 1998, scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research working in Dubna, Russia bombarded plutonium (Pu) with calcium (Ca) to produce a single atom of element&nbsp;114, flerovium (Fl). Preliminary chemistry experiments have indicated this element may be the first superheavy element to show abnormal noble-gas-like properties, even though it is a member of group 14 on the periodic table. In October 2006, scientists from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory successfully created synthetically ununoctium (Uuo), the seventh element in group&nbsp;18, by bombarding californium (Cf) with calcium (Ca).</p>\n<h2>Physical and atomic properties</h2>\n<div>\n\nFor more data, see Noble gas (data page).</div>\n<p>The noble gases have weak interatomic force, and consequently have very low melting and boiling points. They are all monatomic gases under standard conditions, including the elements with larger atomic masses than many normally solid elements. Helium has several unique qualities when compared with other elements: its boiling and melting points are lower than those of any other known substance; it is the only element known to exhibit superfluidity; it is the only element that cannot be solidified by cooling under standard conditions—a pressure of 25 standard atmospheres (2,500&nbsp;kPa; 370&nbsp;psi) must be applied at a temperature of 0.95 K (−272.200&nbsp;°C; −457.960&nbsp;°F) to convert it to a solid. The noble gases up to xenon have multiple stable isotopes. Radon has no stable isotopes; its longest-lived isotope, Rn, has a half-life of 3.8&nbsp;days and decays to form helium and polonium, which ultimately decays to lead.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThis is a plot of ionization potential versus atomic number. The noble gases, which are labeled, have the largest ionization potential for each period.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The noble gas atoms, like atoms in most groups, increase steadily in atomic radius from one period to the next due to the increasing number of electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom. Noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity. Some of the heavier noble gases, however, have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules. It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential similar to that of the oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride, an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions; that is, they have a negative electron affinity.</p>\n<p>The macroscopic physical properties of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases with the size of the atom as a result of the increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group&nbsp;18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.</p>\n<p>The noble gases are nearly ideal gases under standard conditions, but their deviations from the ideal gas law provided important clues for the study of intermolecular interactions. The Lennard-Jones potential, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard-Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms spherical, which means that the interaction between the atoms is independent of direction, or isotropic.</p>\n<h2>Chemical properties</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNeon, like all noble gases, has a full valence shell. Noble gases have eight electrons in the outermost shell, except in the case of helium, which has two.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The noble gases are colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonflammable under standard conditions. They were once labeled <i>group&nbsp;0</i> in the periodic table because it was believed they had a valence of zero, meaning their atoms cannot combine with those of other elements to form compounds. However, it was later discovered some do indeed form compounds, causing this label to fall into disuse.</p>\n<p>Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration, especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior:</p>\n\n<p>The noble gases have full valence electron shells. Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding. Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. However, heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such as helium, making it easier to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases.</p>\n<h3>Noble gas notation</h3>\n<p>As a result of a full shell, the noble gases can be used in conjunction with the electron configuration notation to form the <i>noble gas notation</i>. To do this, the nearest noble gas that precedes the element in question is written first, and then the electron configuration is continued from that point forward. For example, the electron notation of carbon is 1s2s2p, and the noble gas notation is [He]2s2p. This notation makes it easier to identify elements, and is shorter than writing out the full notation of atomic orbitals.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: Noble gas compound</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of XeF\n4, one of the first noble gas compounds to be discovered</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The noble gases show extremely low chemical reactivity; consequently, only a few hundred noble gas compounds have been formed. Neutral compounds in which helium and neon are involved in chemical bonds have not been formed (although there is some theoretical evidence for a few helium compounds), while xenon, krypton, and argon have shown only minor reactivity. The reactivity follows the order Ne &lt; He &lt; Ar &lt; Kr &lt; Xe &lt; Rn.</p>\n<p>In 1933, Linus Pauling predicted that the heavier noble gases could form compounds with fluorine and oxygen. He predicted the existence of krypton hexafluoride (KrF\n6) and xenon hexafluoride (XeF\n6), speculated that XeF\n8 might exist as an unstable compound, and suggested xenic acid could form perxenate salts. These predictions were shown to be generally accurate, except that XeF\n8 is now thought to be both thermodynamically and kinetically unstable.</p>\n<p>Xenon compounds are the most numerous of the noble gas compounds that have been formed. Most of them have the xenon atom in the oxidation state of +2, +4, +6, or +8 bonded to highly electronegative atoms such as fluorine or oxygen, as in xenon difluoride (XeF\n2), xenon tetrafluoride (XeF\n4), xenon hexafluoride (XeF\n6), xenon tetroxide (XeO\n4), and sodium perxenate (Na\n4XeO\n6). Some of these compounds have found use in chemical synthesis as oxidizing agents; XeF\n2, in particular, is commercially available and can be used as a fluorinating agent. As of 2007, about five hundred compounds of xenon bonded to other elements have been identified, including organoxenon compounds (containing xenon bonded to carbon), and xenon bonded to nitrogen, chlorine, gold, mercury, and xenon itself. Compounds of xenon bound to boron, hydrogen, bromine, iodine, beryllium, sulphur, titanium, copper, and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in noble gas matrices, or in supersonic noble gas jets.</p>\n<p>In theory, radon is more reactive than xenon, and therefore should form chemical bonds more easily than xenon does. However, due to the high radioactivity and short half-life of radon isotopes, only a few fluorides and oxides of radon have been formed in practice.</p>\n<p>Krypton is less reactive than xenon, but several compounds have been reported with krypton in the oxidation state of +2. Krypton difluoride is the most notable and easily characterized. Compounds in which krypton forms a single bond to nitrogen and oxygen have also been characterized, but are only stable below −60 °C (−76&nbsp;°F) and −90 °C (−130&nbsp;°F) respectively.</p>\n<p>Krypton atoms chemically bound to other nonmetals (hydrogen, chlorine, carbon) as well as some late transition metals (copper, silver, gold) have also been observed, but only either at low temperatures in noble gas matrices, or in supersonic noble gas jets. Similar conditions were used to obtain the first few compounds of argon in 2000, such as argon fluorohydride (HArF), and some bound to the late transition metals copper, silver, and gold. As of 2007, no stable neutral molecules involving covalently bound helium or neon are known.</p>\n<p>The noble gases—including helium—can form stable molecular ions in the gas phase. The simplest is the helium hydride molecular ion, HeH, discovered in 1925. Because it is composed of the two most abundant elements in the universe, hydrogen and helium, it is believed to occur naturally in the interstellar medium, although it has not been detected yet. In addition to these ions, there are many known neutral excimers of the noble gases. These are compounds such as ArF and KrF that are stable only when in an excited electronic state; some of them find application in excimer lasers.</p>\n<p>In addition to the compounds where a noble gas atom is involved in a covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAn endohedral fullerene compound containing a noble gas atom</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Noble gases can form endohedral fullerene compounds, in which the noble gas atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. In 1993, it was discovered that when C\n60, a spherical molecule consisting of 60&nbsp;carbon&nbsp;atoms, is exposed to noble gases at high pressure, complexes such as He@C\n60 can be formed (the <i>@</i> notation indicates He is contained inside C\n60 but not covalently bound to it). As of 2008, endohedral complexes with helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon have been obtained. These compounds have found use in the study of the structure and reactivity of fullerenes by means of the nuclear magnetic resonance of the noble gas atom.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBonding in XeF\n2 according to the 3-center-4-electron bond model</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Noble gas compounds such as xenon difluoride (XeF\n2) are considered to be hypervalent because they violate the octet rule. Bonding in such compounds can be explained using a three-center four-electron bond model. This model, first proposed in 1951, considers bonding of three collinear atoms. For example, bonding in XeF\n2 is described by a set of three molecular orbitals (MOs) derived from p-orbitals on each atom. Bonding results from the combination of a filled p-orbital from Xe with one half-filled p-orbital from each F atom, resulting in a filled bonding orbital, a filled non-bonding orbital, and an empty antibonding orbital. The highest occupied molecular orbital is localized on the two terminal atoms. This represents a localization of charge which is facilitated by the high electronegativity of fluorine.</p>\n<p>The chemistry of heavier noble gases, krypton and xenon, are well established. The chemistry of the lighter ones, argon and helium, is still at an early stage, while a neon compound is still yet to be identified.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<p>The abundances of the noble gases in the universe decrease as their atomic numbers increase. Helium is the most common element in the universe after hydrogen, with a mass fraction of about 24%. Most of the helium in the universe was formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis, but the amount of helium is steadily increasing due to the fusion of hydrogen in stellar nucleosynthesis (and, to a very slight degree, the alpha decay of heavy elements). Abundances on Earth follow different trends; for example, helium is only the third most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere. The reason is that there is no primordial helium in the atmosphere; due to the small mass of the atom, helium cannot be retained by the Earth's gravitational field. Helium on Earth comes from the alpha decay of heavy elements such as uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust, and tends to accumulate in natural gas deposits. The abundance of argon, on the other hand, is increased as a result of the beta decay of potassium-40, also found in the Earth's crust, to form argon-40, which is the most abundant isotope of argon on Earth despite being relatively rare in the Solar System. This process is the base for the potassium-argon dating method. Xenon has an unexpectedly low abundance in the atmosphere, in what has been called the <i>missing xenon problem</i>; one theory is that the missing xenon may be trapped in minerals inside the Earth's crust. After the discovery of xenon dioxide, a research showed that Xe can substitute for Si in the quartz. Radon is formed in the lithosphere as from the alpha decay of radium. It can seep into buildings through cracks in their foundation and accumulate in areas that are not well ventilated. Due to its high radioactivity, radon presents a significant health hazard; it is implicated in an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States alone.</p>\n<center>\n\n</center>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from air using the methods of liquefaction of gases, to convert elements to a liquid state, and fractional distillation, to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The prices of the noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance, with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive. As an example, the table to the right lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLiquid helium is used to cool the superconducting magnets in modern MRI scanners.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Noble gases have very low boiling and melting points, which makes them useful as cryogenic refrigerants. In particular, liquid helium, which boils at 4.2 K (−268.95&nbsp;°C; −452.11&nbsp;°F), is used for superconducting magnets, such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium, also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40&nbsp;times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.</p>\n<p>Helium is used as a component of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or <i>the bends</i>. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGoodyear Blimp</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Since the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, helium has replaced hydrogen as a lifting gas in blimps and balloons due to its lightness and incombustibility, despite an 8.6% decrease in buoyancy.</p>\n<p>In many applications, the noble gases are used to provide an inert atmosphere. Argon is used in the synthesis of air-sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as reactive intermediates, by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography, as a filler gas for thermometers, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber. Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n15,000-watt xenon short-arc lamp used in IMAX projectors</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Noble gases are commonly used in lighting because of their lack of chemical reactivity. Argon, mixed with nitrogen, is used as a filler gas for incandescent light bulbs. Krypton is used in high-performance light bulbs, which have higher color temperatures and greater efficiency, because it reduces the rate of evaporation of the filament more than argon; halogen lamps, in particular, use krypton mixed with small amounts of compounds of iodine or bromine. The noble gases glow in distinctive colors when used inside gas-discharge lamps, such as \"neon lights\". These lights are called after neon but often contain other gases and phosphors, which add various hues to the orange-red color of neon. Xenon is commonly used in xenon arc lamps which, due to their nearly continuous spectrum that resembles daylight, find application in film projectors and as automobile headlamps.</p>\n<p>The noble gases are used in excimer lasers, which are based on short-lived electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar, Kr or Xe, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248&nbsp;nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser angioplasty and eye surgery.</p>\n<p>Some noble gases have direct application in medicine. Helium is sometimes used to improve the ease of breathing of asthma sufferers. Xenon is used as an anesthetic because of its high solubility in lipids, which makes it more potent than the usual nitrous oxide, and because it is readily eliminated from the body, resulting in faster recovery. Xenon finds application in medical imaging of the lungs through hyperpolarized MRI. Radon, which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts, is used in radiotherapy.</p>\n<h2>Discharge color</h2>\n<center>\n\n</center>\n<p>The color of gas discharge emission depends on several factors, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>discharge parameters (local value of current density and electric field, temperature, etc. – note the color variation along the discharge in the top row);</li>\n<li>gas purity (even small fraction of certain gases can affect color);</li>\n<li>material of the discharge tube envelope – note suppression of the UV and blue components in the bottom-row tubes made of thick household glass.</li>\n</ul>"

  "title": "Lithium",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For the use of lithium as a medication, see Lithium (medication).  For other uses, see Lithium (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Lithium</b> (from Greek <i>lithos</i> 'stone') is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Li</b> and atomic number&nbsp;3. It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard conditions it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, lithium exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, only appears in compounds, which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.</p>\n<p>The nuclei of lithium verge on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though the nuclei are very light in atomic weight. For related reasons, lithium has important links to nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium-6 deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, high strength-to-weight alloys used in aircraft, lithium batteries and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than half of lithium production.</p>\n<p>Trace amounts of lithium are present in all organisms. The element serves no apparent vital biological function, since animals and plants survive in good health without it. Non-vital functions have not been ruled out. The lithium ion Li administered as any of several lithium salts has proved to be useful as a mood-stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder, due to neurological effects of the ion in the human body.</p>\n\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<div>Main article: Alkali metal</div>\n<h3>Atomic and physical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>Lithium pellets covered in white lithium hydroxide (left) and ingots with a thin layer of black oxide tarnish (right)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Like the other alkali metals, lithium has a single valence electron that is easily given up to form a cation. Because of this, it is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well as a highly reactive element, though the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity compared to other alkali metals is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in lithium's 1s orbital and are much lower in energy, and therefore they do not participate in chemical bonds).</p>\n<p>Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife. When cut, it possesses a silvery-white color that quickly changes to gray due to oxidation. While it has one of the lowest melting points among all metals (180 °C), it has the highest melting and boiling points of the alkali metals.</p>\n<p>Lithium has a very low density of 0.534 g/cm, comparable with that of pine wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature, the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm) being more than 60% denser. Furthermore, apart from helium and hydrogen, it is less dense than any liquid element, being only 2/3 as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm). Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLithium floating in oil</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Lithium's coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron. It has the highest specific heat capacity of any solid element. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (&gt;20 GPa) At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is the most prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been reported for lithium at high pressures.</p>\n<p>Because of its specific heat capacity, the highest of all solids, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications.</p>\n<h3>Chemistry and compounds</h3>\n<p>Lithium reacts with water easily, but with noticeably less energy than other alkali metals do. The reaction forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually stored under cover of a hydrocarbon, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals can be stored in more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·HO), lithium nitride (LiN) and lithium carbonate (LiCO, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHexameric structure of the n-butyllithium fragment in a crystal</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When placed over a flame, lithium compounds give off a striking crimson color, but when it burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent, as the hydrogen produced will not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers, specifically the Class D type (see Types of extinguishing agents). Lithium is the only metal which reacts with nitrogen under normal conditions.</p>\n<p>Lithium has a diagonal relationship with magnesium, an element of similar atomic and ionic radius. Chemical resemblances between the two metals include the formation of a nitride by reaction with N, the formation of an oxide (Li\n2O) and peroxide (Li\n2O\n2) when burnt in O, salts with similar solubilities, and thermal instability of the carbonates and nitrides. The metal reacts with hydrogen gas at high temperatures to produce lithium hydride (LiH).</p>\n<p>Other known binary compounds include the halides (LiF, LiCl, LiBr, LiI), and the sulfide (Li\n2S), the superoxide (LiO\n2), carbide (Li\n2C\n2). Many other inorganic compounds are known, where lithium combines with anions to form various salts: borates, amides, carbonate, nitrate, or borohydride (LiBH\n4). Multiple organolithium reagents are known where there is a direct bond between carbon and lithium atoms effectively creating a carbanion. These are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. In many of these organolithium compounds, the lithium ions tend to aggregate into high-symmetry clusters by themselves, which is relatively common for alkali cations. LiHe, a very weakly interacting van der Waals compound, has been detected at very low temperatures. </p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of lithium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, Li and Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon compared to the next lighter and heavier elements, helium and beryllium, which means that alone among stable light elements, lithium can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being Li with a half-life of 838 ms and Li with a half-life of 178&nbsp;ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6&nbsp;ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10 s.</p>\n<p>Li is one of the primordial elements (or, more properly, primordial nuclides) produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis. A small amount of both Li and Li are produced in stars, but are thought to be burned as fast as produced. Additional small amounts of lithium of both Li and Li may be generated from solar wind, cosmic rays hitting heavier atoms, and from early solar system Be and Be radioactive decay. While lithium is created in stars during the Stellar nucleosynthesis, it is further burnt. Li can also be generated in carbon stars.</p>\n<p>Lithium isotopes fractionate substantially during a wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where Li is preferred to Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes.</p>\n<p>Nuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics uses are a major source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an extent as to slightly but measurably change the Li to Li ratios even in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLithium is about as common as chlorine in the Earth's upper continental crust, on a per-atom basis.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Astronomical</h3>\n<div>Main article: Nucleosynthesis</div>\n<p>According to modern cosmological theory, lithium—as both of its stable isotopes lithium-6 and lithium-7—was among the 3 elements synthesized in the Big Bang. Though the amount of lithium generated in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is dependent upon the number of photons per baryon, for accepted values the lithium abundance can be calculated, and there is a \"cosmological lithium discrepancy\" in the Universe: older stars seem to have less lithium than they should, and some younger stars have far more. The lack of lithium in older stars is apparently caused by the \"mixing\" of lithium into the interior of stars, where it is destroyed. Furthermore, lithium is produced in younger stars. Though it transmutes into two atoms of helium due to collision with a proton at temperatures above 2.4 million degrees Celsius (most stars easily attain this temperature in their interiors), lithium is more abundant than predicted in later-generation stars, for causes not yet completely understood.</p>\n<p>Though it was one of the three first elements (together with helium and hydrogen) to be synthesized in the Big Bang, lithium, together with beryllium and boron are markedly less abundant than other nearby elements. This is a result of the low temperature necessary to destroy lithium, and a lack of common processes to produce it.</p>\n<p>Lithium is also found in brown dwarf substellar objects and certain anomalous orange stars. Because lithium is present in cooler, less-massive brown dwarfs, but is destroyed in hotter red dwarf stars, its presence in the stars' spectra can be used in the \"lithium test\" to differentiate the two, as both are smaller than the Sun. Certain orange stars can also contain a high concentration of lithium. Those orange stars found to have a higher than usual concentration of lithium (such as Centaurus X-4) orbit massive objects—neutron stars or black holes—whose gravity evidently pulls heavier lithium to the surface of a hydrogen-helium star, causing more lithium to be observed.</p>\n<h3>Terrestrial</h3>\n\n<div>See also: Lithium minerals</div>\n<p>Although lithium is widely distributed on Earth, it does not naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity. The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm), or 25 micromolar; higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents.</p>\n<p>Estimates for crustal content range from 20 to 70 ppm by weight. In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks, with the largest concentrations in granites. Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources. Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite. A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States. At 20&nbsp;mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust, lithium is the 25th most abundant element.</p>\n<p>According to the <i>Handbook of Lithium and Natural Calcium</i>, \"Lithium is a comparatively rare element, although it is found in many rocks and some brines, but always in very low concentrations. There are a fairly large number of both lithium mineral and brine deposits but only comparatively few of them are of actual or potential commercial value. Many are very small, others are too low in grade.\"</p>\n<p>One of the largest <i>reserve base</i> of lithium is in the Salar de Uyuni area of Bolivia, which has 5.4 million tonnes. US Geological Survey, estimates that in 2010 Chile had the largest reserves by far (7.5 million tonnes) and the highest annual production (8,800 tonnes). Other major suppliers include Australia, Argentina and China.</p>\n<p>In June 2010, the New York Times reported that American geologists were conducting ground surveys on dry salt lakes in western Afghanistan believing that large deposits of lithium are located there. \"Pentagon officials said that their initial analysis at one location in Ghazni Province showed the potential for lithium deposits as large as those of Bolivia, which now has the world's largest known lithium reserves.\" These estimates are \"based principally on old data, which was gathered mainly by the Soviets during their occupation of Afghanistan from 1979–1989\" and \"Stephen Peters, the head of the USGS's Afghanistan Minerals Project, said that he was unaware of USGS involvement in any new surveying for minerals in Afghanistan in the past two years. 'We are not aware of any discoveries of lithium,' he said.\"</p>\n<h3>Biological</h3>\n<p>Lithium is found in trace amount in numerous plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb). In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids have been found to contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb. Marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial ones. It is not known whether lithium has a physiological role in any of these organisms, but nutritional studies in mammals have indicated its importance to health, leading to a suggestion that it be classed as an essential trace element with an RDA of 1&nbsp;mg/day. Observational studies in Japan, reported in 2011, suggested that naturally occurring lithium in drinking water may increase human lifespan.</p>\n<h2>History of discovery and use</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nJohan August Arfwedson is credited with the discovery of lithium in 1817</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Petalite (LiAlSiO) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist and statesman José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva in a mine on the island of Utö, Sweden. However, it was not until 1817 that Johan August Arfwedson, then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore. This element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium, though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline. Berzelius gave the alkaline material the name \"<i>lithion</i>/<i>lithina</i>\", from the Greek word <i>λιθoς</i> (transliterated as <i>lithos</i>, meaning \"stone\"), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood. He named the metal inside the material \"<i>lithium</i>\".</p>\n<p>Arfwedson later showed that this same element was present in the minerals spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin was the first to observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure henceforth led to commercial production of lithium, beginning in 1923, by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.</p>\n<p>The production and use of lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines or similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use was supported by the fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small market for lithium soaps and the lubricating greases based upon them was supported by several small mining operations mostly in the United States.</p>\n<p>The demand for lithium increased dramatically during the Cold War with the production of nuclear fusion weapons. Both lithium-6 and lithium-7 produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons, and are thus useful for the production of tritium by itself, as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride. The United States became the prime producer of lithium in the period between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s. At the end, the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide. The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium-6 by 75%, which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals, and even the atomic weight of lithium in some \"natural sources\" of lithium ion which had been \"contaminated\" by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities, which had found its way into ground water.</p>\n<p>Lithium was used to decrease the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall-Héroult process. These two uses dominated the market until the middle of the 1990s. After the end of the nuclear arms race the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices. But in the mid-1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive method than underground or even open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials as only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price. For example, the US mines near Kings Mountain, North Carolina closed before the turn of the 21 century.</p>\n<p>The use in lithium ion batteries increased the demand for lithium and became the dominant use in 2007. With the surge of lithium demand in batteries in the 2000s, new companies have expanded brine extraction efforts to meet the rising demand.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>Satellite images of the Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina (left), and Uyuni, Bolivia (right), salt flats are rich in lithium. The lithium-rich brine is concentrated by pumping it into solar evaporation ponds (visible in the left image).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Since the end of World War II lithium production has greatly increased. The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals such as those above. Lithium salts are extracted from the water of mineral springs, brine pools and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused 55% lithium chloride and 45% potassium chloride at about 450 C. In 1998 it was about 95 US$ / kg (or 43 US$/pound).</p>\n<p>Worldwide identified reserves of lithium in 2008 were estimated by the US Geological Survey as 13 million tonnes. Deposits of lithium are found in South America throughout the Andes mountain chain. Chile is the leading lithium producer, followed by Argentina. Both countries recover the lithium from brine pools. In the United States lithium is recovered from brine pools in Nevada. However, half the world's known reserves are located in Bolivia, a nation sitting along the central eastern slope of the Andes. In 2009 Bolivia was negotiating with Japanese, French, and Korean firms to begin extraction. According to the US Geological Survey, Bolivia's Uyuni Desert has 5.4 million tonnes of lithium. A newly-discovered deposit in Wyoming's Rock Springs Uplift is estimated at 228,000 tons. Additional deposits in the same formation were extrapolated to be as much as 18 million tons.</p>\n<p>After an industry wide pricing reduction for lithium carbonate after the Great Financial Crisis, where major suppliers such as Sociedad Química y Minera (SQM) dropped pricing by 20% in light of incoming lithium resource developers and to further defend their market position, pricing in 2012 scaled up due to increased lithium demand. A 2012 Business Week article outlined the existing oligopoly in the lithium space, \"SQM, controlled by billionaire Julio Ponce, is the second-largest, followed by Rockwood, which is backed by Henry Kravis’s KKR &amp; Co., and Philadelphia-based FMC.\" Global consumption may jump to 300,000 metric tons a year by 2020 from about 150,000 tons in 2012, as demand for lithium batteries has been growing at about 25 percent a year, outpacing the 4 percent to 5 percent overall gain in lithium</p>\n<p>A potential source is geothermal wells. Geothermal fluids carry leachates to the surface; recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field. As the lithium is separated by simple filtration techniques, the process and environmental costs are primarily that of the already-operating geothermal well; relative environmental impacts may thus be positive.</p>\n<p>There are differing opinions about the potential growth of lithium production. According to a 2011 study conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium should not be a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles, as the study estimated that on the order of 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries could be built with current reserves. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found that there are sufficient lithium resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread use of hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles. The study estimated global lithium reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.</p>\n<p>However, another study concluded that \"realistically achievable lithium carbonate production will be sufficient for only a small fraction of future PHEV and EV global market requirements\", that \"demand from the portable electronics sector will absorb much of the planned production increases in the next decade\", and that \"mass production of lithium carbonate is not environmentally sound, it will cause irreparable ecological damage to ecosystems that should be protected and that LiIon propulsion is incompatible with the notion of the 'Green Car'\".</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEstimates of global lithium uses in 2011\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceramics and glass (29%)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Batteries (27%)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lubricating greases (12%)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous casting (5%)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Air treatment (4%)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymers (3%)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary aluminum production (2%)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmaceuticals (2%)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other (16%)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Ceramics and glass</h3>\n<p>Lithium oxide is a widely used flux for processing silica, reducing the melting point and viscosity of the material and leading to glazes of improved physical properties including low coefficients for thermal expansion. Lithium oxides are a component of ovenware. Worldwide, this is the single largest use for lithium compounds (see chart). Lithium carbonate (LiCO) is generally used in this application: upon heating it converts to the oxide.</p>\n<h3>Electrical and electronics</h3>\n<p>In the later years of the 20th century, owing to its high electrochemical potential, lithium became an important component of the electrolyte and of one of the electrodes in batteries. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Because of its low atomic mass, it also has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. Lithium batteries are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as an anode. Lithium batteries are not to be confused with lithium-ion batteries, which are high energy-density rechargeable batteries. Other rechargeable batteries include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.</p>\n<h3>Lubricating greases</h3>\n<p>The third most common use of lithium is in greases. Lithium hydroxide is a strong base and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of lithium stearate. Lithium soap has the ability to thicken oils, and it is used to manufacture all-purpose, high-temperature lubricating greases.</p>\n<h3>Metallurgy</h3>\n<p>When used as a flux for welding or soldering, metallic lithium promotes the fusing of metals during the process and eliminates the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities. Its fusing quality is also important as a flux for producing ceramics, enamels and glass.</p>\n<p>Alloys of the metal with aluminium, cadmium, copper and manganese are used to make high-performance aircraft parts (see also Lithium-aluminium alloys).</p>\n<h3>Other chemical and industrial uses</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLithium use in flares and pyrotechnics is due to its rose-red flame.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Pyrotechnics</h4>\n<p>Lithium compounds are used as pyrotechnic colorants and oxidizers in red fireworks and flares.</p>\n<h4>Air purification</h4>\n<p>Lithium chloride and lithium bromide are hygroscopic and are used as desiccants for gas streams. Lithium hydroxide and lithium peroxide are the salts most used in confined areas, such as aboard spacecraft and submarines, for carbon dioxide removal and air purification. Lithium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air by forming lithium carbonate, and is preferred over other alkaline hydroxides for its low weight.</p>\n<p>Lithium peroxide (LiO) in presence of moisture not only absorbs carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate, but also releases oxygen. For example:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 LiO + 2 CO → 2 LiCO + O.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Some of the aforementioned compounds, as well as lithium perchlorate, are used in oxygen candles that supply submarines with oxygen.</p>\n<h4>Optics</h4>\n<p>Lithium fluoride, artificially grown as crystal, is clear and transparent and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications. It has one of the lowest refractive indexes and the farthest transmission range in the deep UV of most common materials. Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified. Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.</p>\n<p>The high non-linearity of lithium niobate also makes it useful in non-linear optics applications. It is used extensively in telecommunication products such as mobile phones and optical modulators, for such components as resonant crystals. Lithium applications are used in more than 60% of mobile phones.</p>\n<h4>Lithium compounds in organic and polymer chemistry</h4>\n<p>Organolithium compounds are widely used in the production of polymer and fine-chemicals. In the polymer industry, which is the dominant consumer of these reagents, alkyl lithium compounds are catalysts/initiators. in anionic polymerization of unfunctionalized olefins. For the production of fine chemicals, organolithium compounds function as strong bases and as reagents for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Organolithium compounds are prepared from lithium metal and alkyl halides.</p>\n<p>Many other lithium compounds are used as reagents to prepare organic compounds. Some popular compounds include lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH), lithium triethylborohydride (LiBH(CH)).</p>\n<h4>Military applications</h4>\n<p>Metallic lithium and its complex hydrides, such as Li[AlH], are used as high energy additives to rocket propellants.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe launch of a torpedo using lithium as fuel</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The Mark 50 Torpedo stored chemical energy propulsion system (SCEPS) uses a small tank of sulfur hexafluoride gas which is sprayed over a block of solid lithium. The reaction generates heat which is used to generate steam. The steam propels the torpedo in a closed Rankine cycle.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear</h3>\n<p>Lithium-6 is valued as a source material for tritium production and as a neutron absorber in nuclear fusion. Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons. Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLithium deuteride was used as fuel in the Castle Bravo nuclear device.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Lithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb. When bombarded by neutrons, both Li and Li produce tritium — this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested, was responsible for the runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test. Tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve. Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride still apparently plays a role in modern nuclear weapons, as a fusion material.</p>\n<p>Lithium fluoride, when highly enriched in the lithium-7 isotope, forms the basic constituent of the fluoride salt mixture LiF-BeF used in liquid fluoride nuclear reactors. Lithium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF-BeF mixtures have low melting points. In addition, Li, Be, and F are among the few nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross-sections not to poison the fission reactions inside a nuclear fission reactor.</p>\n<p>In conceptualized nuclear fusion power plants, lithium will be used to produce tritium in magnetically confined reactors using deuterium and tritium as the fuel. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare, and must be synthetically produced by surrounding the reacting plasma with a 'blanket' containing lithium where neutrons from the deuterium-tritium reaction in the plasma will fission the lithium to produce more tritium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Li + n → He + T.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Lithium is also used as a source for alpha particles, or helium nuclei. When Li is bombarded by accelerated protons Be is formed, which undergoes fission to form two alpha particles. This feat, called \"splitting the atom\" at the time, was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction. It was produced by Cockroft and Walton in 1932. (Nuclear reactions and human-directed nuclear transmutation had been accomplished as early as 1917, but by using natural radioactive bombardment with alpha particles).</p>\n<h3>Medicine</h3>\n<div>Main article: Lithium (medication)</div>\n<p>In the treatment of bipolar disorder, lithium compounds continue to be the standard against which newer medications are measured. Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression. The active principle in these salts is the lithium ion Li, although detailed mechanisms are debated.</p>\n<p>There have been suggestions of increased risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women taking lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Lithium is corrosive and requires special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate the nose and throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because of the caustic hydroxide produced when it is in contact with moisture. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.</p>\n<h3>Regulation</h3>\n<p>Some jurisdictions limit the sale of lithium batteries, which are the most readily available source of lithium for ordinary consumers. Lithium can be used to reduce pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the Birch reduction method, which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous ammonia. Carriage and shipment of some kinds of lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium batteries have thermal overload protection built-in to prevent this type of incident, or their design inherently limits short-circuit currents. Internal shorts have been known to develop due to manufacturing defects or damage to batteries that can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.</p>"

  "title": "Solid",
  "html": "<div>For other uses, see Solid (disambiguation).</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSingle crystalline form of solid Insulin.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p><b>Solid</b> is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being liquid, gas, and plasma). It is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to changes of shape or volume. Unlike a liquid, a solid object does not flow to take on the shape of its container, nor does it expand to fill the entire volume available to it like a gas does. The atoms in a solid are tightly bound to each other, either in a regular geometric lattice (crystalline solids, which include metals and ordinary water ice) or irregularly (an amorphous solid such as common window glass).</p>\n<p>The branch of physics that deals with solids is called solid-state physics, and is the main branch of condensed matter physics (which also includes liquids). Materials science is primarily concerned with the physical and chemical properties of solids. Solid-state chemistry is especially concerned with the synthesis of novel materials, as well as the science of identification and chemical composition.</p>\n\n<h2>Microscopic description</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nModel of closely packed atoms within a crystalline solid.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The atoms, molecules or ions which make up a solid may be arranged in an orderly repeating pattern, or irregularly. Materials whose constituents are arranged in a regular pattern are known as crystals. In some cases, the regular ordering can continue unbroken over a large scale, for example diamonds, where each diamond is a single crystal. Solid objects that are large enough to see and handle are rarely composed of a single crystal, but instead are made of a large number of single crystals, known as crystallites, whose size can vary from a few nanometers to several meters. Such materials are called polycrystalline. Almost all common metals, and many ceramics, are polycrystalline.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>Schematic representation of a random-network glassy form (left) and ordered crystalline lattice (right) of identical chemical composition.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In other materials, there is no long-range order in the position of the atoms. These solids are known as amorphous solids; examples include polystyrene and glass.</p>\n<p>Whether a solid is crystalline or amorphous depends on the material involved, and the conditions in which it was formed. Solids which are formed by slow cooling will tend to be crystalline, while solids which are frozen rapidly are more likely to be amorphous. Likewise, the specific crystal structure adopted by a crystalline solid depends on the material involved and on how it was formed.</p>\n<p>While many common objects, such as an ice cube or a coin, are chemically identical throughout, many other common materials comprise a number of different substances packed together. For example, a typical rock is an aggregate of several different minerals and mineraloids, with no specific chemical composition. Wood is a natural organic material consisting primarily of cellulose fibers embedded in a matrix of organic lignin. In materials science, composites of more than one constituent material can be designed to have desired properties.</p>\n<h2>Classes of solids</h2>\n<div>Further information: Bonding in solids</div>\n<p>The forces between the atoms in a solid can take a variety of forms. For example, a crystal of sodium chloride (common salt) is made up of ionic sodium and chlorine, which are held together by ionic bonds. In diamond or silicon, the atoms share electrons and form covalent bonds. In metals, electrons are shared in metallic bonding. Some solids, particularly most organic compounds, are held together with van der Waals forces resulting from the polarization of the electronic charge cloud on each molecule. The dissimilarities between the types of solid result from the differences between their bonding.</p>\n<h3>Metals</h3>\n<div>Main article: Metal</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe pinnacle of New York's Chrysler Building, the world's tallest steel-supported brick building, is clad with stainless steel.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Metals typically are strong, dense, and good conductors of both electricity and heat. The bulk of the elements in the periodic table, those to the left of a diagonal line drawn from boron to polonium, are metals. Mixtures of two or more elements in which the major component is a metal are known as alloys.</p>\n<p>People have been using metals for a variety of purposes since prehistoric times. The strength and reliability of metals has led to their widespread use in construction of buildings and other structures, as well as in most vehicles, many appliances and tools, pipes, road signs and railroad tracks. Iron and aluminium are the two most commonly used structural metals, and they are also the most abundant metals in the Earth's crust. Iron is most commonly used in the form of an alloy, steel, which contains up to 2.1% carbon, making it much harder than pure iron.</p>\n<p>Because metals are good conductors of electricity, they are valuable in electrical appliances and for carrying an electric current over long distances with little energy loss or dissipation. Thus, electrical power grids rely on metal cables to distribute electricity. Home electrical systems, for example, are wired with copper for its good conducting properties and easy machinability. The high thermal conductivity of most metals also makes them useful for stovetop cooking utensils.</p>\n<p>The study of metallic elements and their alloys makes up a significant portion of the fields of solid-state chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering.</p>\n<p>Metallic solids are held together by a high density of shared, delocalized electrons, known as \"metallic bonding\". In a metal, atoms readily lose their outermost (\"valence\") electrons, forming positive ions. The free electrons are spread over the entire solid, which is held together firmly by electrostatic interactions between the ions and the electron cloud. The large number of free electrons gives metals their high values of electrical and thermal conductivity. The free electrons also prevent transmission of visible light, making metals opaque, shiny and lustrous.</p>\n<p>More advanced models of metal properties consider the effect of the positive ions cores on the delocalised electrons. As most metals have crystalline structure, those ions are usually arranged into a periodic lattice. Mathematically, the potential of the ion cores can be treated by various models, the simplest being the nearly free electron model.</p>\n<h3>Minerals</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA collection of various minerals.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Minerals</div>\n<p>Minerals are naturally occurring solids formed through various geological processes under high pressures. To be classified as a true mineral, a substance must have a crystal structure with uniform physical properties throughout. Minerals range in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with thousands of known forms. In contrast, a rock sample is a random aggregate of minerals and/or mineraloids, and has no specific chemical composition. The vast majority of the rocks of the Earth's crust consist of quartz (crystalline SiO), feldspar, mica, chlorite, kaolin, calcite, epidote, olivine, augite, hornblende, magnetite, hematite, limonite and a few other minerals. Some minerals, like quartz, mica or feldspar are common, while others have been found in only a few locations worldwide. The largest group of minerals by far is the silicates (most rocks are ≥95% silicates), which are composed largely of silicon and oxygen, with the addition of ions of aluminium, magnesium, iron, calcium and other metals.</p>\n<h3>Ceramics</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSiN ceramic bearing parts</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Ceramic engineering</div>\n<p>Ceramic solids are composed of inorganic compounds, usually oxides of chemical elements. They are chemically inert, and often are capable of withstanding chemical erosion that occurs in an acidic or caustic environment. Ceramics generally can withstand high temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1600 °C (1800 to 3000 °F). Exceptions include non-oxide inorganic materials, such as nitrides, borides and carbides.</p>\n<p>Traditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as kaolinite, more recent materials include aluminium oxide (alumina). The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include silicon carbide and tungsten carbide. Both are valued for their abrasion resistance, and hence find use in such applications as the wear plates of crushing equipment in mining operations.</p>\n<p>Most ceramic materials, such as alumina and its compounds, are formed from fine powders, yielding a fine grained polycrystalline microstructure which is filled with light scattering centers comparable to the wavelength of visible light. Thus, they are generally opaque materials, as opposed to transparent materials. Recent nanoscale (e.g. sol-gel) technology has, however, made possible the production of polycrystalline transparent ceramics such as transparent alumina and alumina compounds for such applications as high-power lasers. Advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine, electrical and electronics industries.</p>\n<p>Ceramic engineering is the science and technology of creating solid-state ceramic materials, parts and devices. This is done either by the action of heat, or, at lower temperatures, using precipitation reactions from chemical solutions. The term includes the purification of raw materials, the study and production of the chemical compounds concerned, their formation into components, and the study of their structure, composition and properties.</p>\n<p>Mechanically speaking, ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression and weak in shearing and tension. Brittle materials may exhibit significant tensile strength by supporting a static load. Toughness indicates how much energy a material can absorb before mechanical failure, while fracture toughness (denoted K ) describes the ability of a material with inherent microstructural flaws to resist fracture via crack growth and propagation. If a material has a large value of fracture toughness, the basic principles of fracture mechanics suggest that it will most likely undergo ductile fracture. Brittle fracture is very characteristic of most ceramic and glass-ceramic materials which typically exhibit low (and inconsistent) values of K.</p>\n<p>For example of applications of ceramics, the extreme hardness of Zirconia is utilized in the manufacture of knife blades, as well as other industrial cutting tools. Ceramics such as alumina, boron carbide and silicon carbide have been used in bulletproof vests to repel large-caliber rifle fire. Silicon nitride parts are used in ceramic ball bearings, where their high hardness makes them wear resistant. In general, ceramics are also chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would be susceptible to oxidation (or rust).</p>\n<p>As another example of ceramic applications, in the early 1980s, Toyota researched production of an adiabatic ceramic engine with an operating temperature of over 6000 °F (3300 °C). Ceramic engines do not require a cooling system and hence allow a major weight reduction and therefore greater fuel efficiency. In a conventional metallic engine, much of the energy released from the fuel must be dissipated as waste heat in order to prevent a meltdown of the metallic parts. Work is also being done in developing ceramic parts for gas turbine engines. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel. However, such engines are not in production because the manufacturing of ceramic parts in the sufficient precision and durability is difficult and costly. Processing methods often result in a wide distribution of microscopic flaws which frequently play a detrimental role in the sintering process, resulting in the proliferation of cracks, and ultimate mechanical failure.</p>\n<h3>Glass ceramics</h3>\n<div>Main article: Glass-ceramic</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA high strength glass-ceramic cooktop with negligible thermal expansion.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Glass-ceramic materials share many properties with both non-crystalline glasses and crystalline ceramics. They are formed as a glass, and then partially crystallized by heat treatment, producing both amorphous and crystalline phases so that crystalline grains are embedded within a non-crystalline intergranular phase.</p>\n<p>Glass-ceramics are used to make cookware (originally known by the brand name CorningWare) and stovetops which have both high resistance to thermal shock and extremely low permeability to liquids. The negative coefficient of thermal expansion of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive coefficient of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net coefficient of thermal expansion close to zero. This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<p>Glass ceramics may also occur naturally when lightning strikes the crystalline (e.g. quartz) grains found in most beach sand. In this case, the extreme and immediate heat of the lightning (~2500 °C) creates hollow, branching rootlike structures called fulgurite via fusion.</p>\n<h3>Organic solids</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organic chemistry</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe individual wood pulp fibers in this sample are around 10 µm in diameter.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Organic chemistry studies the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation by synthesis (or other means) of chemical compounds of carbon and hydrogen, which may contain any number of other elements such as nitrogen, oxygen and the halogens: fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Some organic compounds may also contain the elements phosphorus or sulfur. Examples of organic solids include wood, paraffin wax, naphthalene and a wide variety of polymers and plastics.</p>\n<h4>Wood</h4>\n<div>Main article: Wood</div>\n<p>Wood is a natural organic material consisting primarily of cellulose fibers embedded in a matrix of lignin. Regarding mechanical properties, the fibers are strong in tension, and the lignin matrix resists compression. Thus wood has been an important construction material since humans began building shelters and using boats. Wood to be used for construction work is commonly known as <i>lumber</i> or <i>timber</i>. In construction, wood is not only a structural material, but is also used to form the mould for concrete.</p>\n<p>Wood-based materials are also extensively used for packaging (e.g. cardboard) and paper which are both created from the refined pulp. The chemical pulping processes use a combination of high temperature and alkaline (kraft) or acidic (sulfite) chemicals to break the chemical bonds of the lignin before burning it out.</p>\n<h4>Polymers</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSTM image of self-assembled supramolecular chains of the organic semiconductor quinacridone on graphite.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Polymer</div>\n<p>One important property of carbon in organic chemistry is that it can form certain compounds, the individual molecules of which are capable of attaching themselves to one another, thereby forming a chain or a network. The process is called polymerization and the chains or networks polymers, while the source compound is a monomer. Two main groups of polymers exist: those artificially manufactured are referred to as industrial polymers or synthetic polymers (plastics) and those naturally occurring as biopolymers.</p>\n<p>Monomers can have various chemical substituents, or functional groups, which can affect the chemical properties of organic compounds, such as solubility and chemical reactivity, as well as the physical properties, such as hardness, density, mechanical or tensile strength, abrasion resistance, heat resistance, transparency, color, etc.. In proteins, these differences give the polymer the ability to adopt a biologically active conformation in preference to others (see self-assembly).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHousehold items made of various kinds of plastic.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>People have been using natural organic polymers for centuries in the form of waxes and shellac which is classified as a thermoplastic polymer. A plant polymer named cellulose provided the tensile strength for natural fibers and ropes, and by the early 19th century natural rubber was in widespread use. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what we commonly call plastics. Plastics are the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Polymers which have been around, and which are in current widespread use, include carbon-based polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, nylons, polyesters, acrylics, polyurethane, and polycarbonates, and silicon-based silicones. Plastics are generally classified as \"commodity\", \"specialty\" and \"engineering\" plastics.</p>\n<h3>Composite materials</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSimulation of the outside of the Space Shuttle as it heats up to over 1500 °C during re-entry</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA cloth of woven carbon fiber filaments, a common element in composite materials</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Composite material</div>\n<p>Composite materials contain two or more macroscopic phases, one of which is often ceramic. For example, a continuous matrix, and a dispersed phase of ceramic particles or fibers.</p>\n<p>Applications of composite materials range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermally insulative tiles which play a key and integral role in NASA's Space Shuttle thermal protection system which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC), the light gray material which withstands reentry temperatures up to 1510 °C (2750 °F) and protects the nose cap and leading edges of Space Shuttle's wings. RCC is a laminated composite material made from graphite rayon cloth and impregnated with a phenolic resin. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured/pyrolized to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon. In order to provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to silicon carbide.</p>\n<p>Domestic examples of composites can be seen in the \"plastic\" casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a composite made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) in which calcium carbonate chalk, talc, glass fibers or carbon fibers have been added for strength, bulk, or electro-static dispersion. These additions may be referred to as reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.</p>\n<p>Thus, the matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials by maintaining their relative positions. The reinforcements impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. A synergism produces material properties unavailable from the individual constituent materials, while the wide variety of matrix and strengthening materials provides the designer with the choice of an optimum combination.</p>\n<h3>Semiconductors</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSemiconductor chip on crystalline silicon substrate.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Semiconductors</div>\n<p>Semiconductors are materials that have an electrical resistivity (and conductivity) between that of metallic conductors and non-metallic insulators. They can be found in the periodic table moving diagonally downward right from boron. They separate the electrical conductors (or metals, to the left) from the insulators (to the right).</p>\n<p>Devices made from semiconductor materials are the foundation of modern electronics, including radio, computers, telephones, etc. Semiconductor devices include the transistor, solar cells, diodes and integrated circuits. Solar photovoltaic panels are large semiconductor devices that directly convert light into electrical energy.</p>\n<p>In a metallic conductor, current is carried by the flow of electrons\", but in semiconductors, current can be carried either by electrons or by the positively charged \"holes\" in the electronic band structure of the material. Common semiconductor materials include silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide.</p>\n<h3>Nanomaterials</h3>\n<div>Main article: Nanotechnology</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBulk silicon (left) and silicon nanopowder (right)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Many traditional solids exhibit different properties when they shrink to nanometer sizes. For example, nanoparticles of usually yellow gold and gray silicon are red in color; gold nanoparticles melt at much lower temperatures (~300 °C for 2.5&nbsp;nm size) than the gold slabs (1064 °C); and metallic nanowires are much stronger than the corresponding bulk metals. The high surface area of nanoparticles makes them extremely attractive for certain applications in the field of energy. For example, platinum metals may be provide improvements as automotive fuel catalysts, as well as proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Also, ceramic oxides (or cermets) of lanthanum, cerium, manganese and nickel are now being developed as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). Lithium, lithium–titanate and tantalum nanoparticles are being applied in lithium ion batteries. Silicon nanoparticles have been shown to dramatically expand the storage capacity of lithium ion batteries during the expansion/contraction cycle. Silicon nanowires cycle without significant degradation and present the potential for use in batteries with greatly expanded storage times. Silicon nanoparticles are also being used in new forms of solar energy cells. Thin film deposition of silicon quantum dots on the polycrystalline silicon substrate of a photovoltaic (solar) cell increases voltage output as much as 60% by fluorescing the incoming light prior to capture. Here again, surface area of the nanoparticles (and thin films) plays a critical role in maximizing the amount of absorbed radiation.</p>\n<h3>Biomaterials</h3>\n<div>Main article: Biomaterials</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCollagen fibers of woven bone</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Many natural (or biological) materials are complex composites with remarkable mechanical properties. These complex structures, which have risen from hundreds of million years of evolution, are inspiring materials scientists in the design of novel materials. Their defining characteristics include structural hierarchy, multifunctionality and self-healing capability. Self-organization is also a fundamental feature of many biological materials and the manner by which the structures are assembled from the molecular level up. Thus, self-assembly is emerging as a new strategy in the chemical synthesis of high performance biomaterials.</p>\n<h2>Physical properties</h2>\n<p>Physical properties of elements and compounds which provide conclusive evidence of chemical composition include odor, color, volume, density (mass per unit volume), melting point, boiling point, heat capacity, physical form and shape at room temperature (solid, liquid or gas; cubic, trigonal crystals, etc.), hardness, porosity, index of refraction and many others. This section discusses some physical properties of materials in the solid state.</p>\n<h3>Mechanical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGranite rock formation in the Chilean Patagonia. Like most inorganic minerals formed by oxidation in the Earth's atmosphere, granite consists primarily of crystalline silica SiO and alumina AlO.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The mechanical properties of materials describe characteristics such as their strength and resistance to deformation. For example, steel beams are used in construction because of their high strength, meaning that they neither break nor bend significantly under the applied load.</p>\n<p>Mechanical properties include elasticity and plasticity, tensile strength, compressive strength, shear strength, fracture toughness, ductility (low in brittle materials), and indentation hardness. Solid mechanics is the study of the behavior of solid matter under external actions such as external forces and temperature changes.</p>\n<p>A solid does not exhibit macroscopic flow, as fluids do. Any degree of departure from its original shape is called deformation. The proportion of deformation to original size is called strain. If the applied stress is sufficiently low, almost all solid materials behave in such a way that the strain is directly proportional to the stress (Hooke's law). The coefficient of the proportion is called the modulus of elasticity or Young's modulus. This region of deformation is known as the linearly elastic region. Three models can describe how a solid responds to an applied stress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elasticity – When an applied stress is removed, the material returns to its undeformed state.</li>\n<li>Viscoelasticity – These are materials that behave elastically, but also have damping. When the applied stress is removed, work has to be done against the damping effects and is converted to heat within the material. This results in a hysteresis loop in the stress–strain curve. This implies that the mechanical response has a time-dependence.</li>\n<li>Plasticity – Materials that behave elastically generally do so when the applied stress is less than a yield value. When the stress is greater than the yield stress, the material behaves plastically and does not return to its previous state. That is, irreversible plastic deformation (or viscous flow) occurs after yield which is permanent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many materials become weaker at high temperatures. Materials which retain their strength at high temperatures, called refractory materials, are useful for many purposes. For example, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking, as they exhibit excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000 °C. In the aerospace industry, high performance materials used in the design of aircraft and/or spacecraft exteriors must have a high resistance to thermal shock. Thus, synthetic fibers spun out of organic polymers and polymer/ceramic/metal composite materials and fiber-reinforced polymers are now being designed with this purpose in mind.</p>\n<h3>Thermal</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNormal modes of atomic vibration in a crystalline solid.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Because solids have thermal energy, their atoms vibrate about fixed mean positions within the ordered (or disordered) lattice. The spectrum of lattice vibrations in a crystalline or glassy network provides the foundation for the kinetic theory of solids. This motion occurs at the atomic level, and thus cannot be observed or detected without highly specialized equipment, such as that used in spectroscopy.</p>\n<p>Thermal properties of solids include thermal conductivity, which is the property of a material that indicates its ability to conduct heat. Solids also have a specific heat capacity, which is the capacity of a material to store energy in the form of heat (or thermal lattice vibrations).</p>\n<h3>Electrical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-videopayload=\"&lt;div class=&quot;mediaContainer&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;width:342px&quot;&gt;&lt;video id=&quot;mwe_player_1&quot; style=&quot;width:342px;height:240px&quot; poster=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Flyingsuperconductor.ogg/341px--Flyingsuperconductor.ogg.jpg&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;kskin&quot; data-durationhint=&quot;9.3257142857143&quot; data-startoffset=&quot;0&quot; data-mwtitle=&quot;Flyingsuperconductor.ogg&quot; data-mwprovider=&quot;wikimediacommons&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Flyingsuperconductor.ogg&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg; codecs=&amp;quot;theora, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; data-title=&quot;Original Ogg file, 341 × 240 (316 kbps)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;Ogg source&quot; data-width=&quot;341&quot; data-height=&quot;240&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;315639&quot; data-framerate=&quot;29.97002997003&quot; /&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/f/f4/Flyingsuperconductor.ogg/Flyingsuperconductor.ogg.360p.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm; codecs=&amp;quot;vp8, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; transcodekey=&quot;360p.webm&quot; data-title=&quot;Web streamable WebM (360P)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;WebM 360P&quot; data-width=&quot;342&quot; data-height=&quot;240&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;500832&quot; data-framerate=&quot;29.97002997003&quot; /&gt;Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.&lt;br /&gt;\nYou can &lt;a href=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Flyingsuperconductor.ogg&quot;&gt;download the clip&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TimedMediaHandler/Client_download&quot;&gt;download a player&lt;/a&gt; to play the clip in your browser.&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nVideo of superconducting levitation of YBCO</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Electrical properties include conductivity, resistance, impedance and capacitance. Electrical conductors such as metals and alloys are contrasted with electrical insulators such as glasses and ceramics. Semiconductors behave somewhere in between. Whereas conductivity in metals is caused by electrons, both electrons and holes contribute to current in semiconductors. Alternatively, ions support electric current in ionic conductors.</p>\n<p>Many materials also exhibit superconductivity at low temperatures; they include metallic elements such as tin and aluminium, various metallic alloys, some heavily doped semiconductors, and certain ceramics. The electrical resistivity of most electrical (metallic) conductors generally decreases gradually as the temperature is lowered, but remains finite. In a superconductor however, the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. An electric current flowing in a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.</p>\n<p>A dielectric, or electrical insulator, is a substance that is highly resistant to the flow of electric current. A dielectric, such as plastic, tends to concentrate an applied electric field within itself which property is used in capacitors. A capacitor is an electrical device that can store energy in the electric field between a pair of closely spaced conductors (called 'plates'). When voltage is applied to the capacitor, electric charges of equal magnitude, but opposite polarity, build up on each plate. Capacitors are used in electrical circuits as energy-storage devices, as well as in electronic filters to differentiate between high-frequency and low-frequency signals.</p>\n<h4>Electro-mechanical</h4>\n<p>Piezoelectricity is the ability of crystals to generate a voltage in response to an applied mechanical stress. The piezoelectric effect is reversible in that piezoelectric crystals, when subjected to an externally applied voltage, can change shape by a small amount. Polymer materials like rubber, wool, hair, wood fiber, and silk often behave as electrets. For example, the polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) exhibits a piezoelectric response several times larger than the traditional piezoelectric material quartz (crystalline SiO). The deformation (~0.1%) lends itself to useful technical applications such as high-voltage sources, loudspeakers, lasers, as well as chemical, biological, and acousto-optic sensors and/or transducers.</p>\n<h3>Optical</h3>\n<p>Materials can transmit (e.g. glass) or reflect (e.g. metals) visible light.</p>\n<p>Many materials will transmit some wavelengths while blocking others. For example, window glass is transparent to visible light, but much less so to most of the frequencies of ultraviolet light that cause sunburn. This property is used for frequency-selective optical filters, which can alter the color of incident light.</p>\n<p>For some purposes, both the optical and mechanical properties of a material can be of interest. For example, the sensors on an infrared homing (\"heat-seeking\") missile must be protected by a cover which is transparent to infrared radiation. The current material of choice for high-speed infrared-guided missile domes is single-crystal sapphire. The optical transmission of sapphire does not actually extend to cover the entire mid-infrared range (3–5&nbsp;µm), but starts to drop off at wavelengths greater than approximately 4.5&nbsp;µm at room temperature. While the strength of sapphire is better than that of other available mid-range infrared dome materials at room temperature, it weakens above 600 °C. A long standing trade-off exists between optical bandpass and mechanical durability; new materials such as transparent ceramics or optical nanocomposites may provide improved performance.</p>\n<p>Guided lightwave transmission involves the field of fiber optics and the ability of certain glasses to transmit, simultaneously and with low loss of intensity, a range of frequencies (multi-mode optical waveguides) with little interference between them. Optical waveguides are used as components in integrated optical circuits or as the transmission medium in optical communication systems.</p>\n<h4>Opto-electronic</h4>\n<div>Main article: Solar cell</div>\n<p>A solar cell or photovoltaic cell is a device that converts light energy into electrical energy. Fundamentally, the device needs to fulfill only two functions: photo-generation of charge carriers (electrons and holes) in a light-absorbing material, and separation of the charge carriers to a conductive contact that will transmit the electricity (simply put, carrying electrons off through a metal contact into an external circuit). This conversion is called the photoelectric effect, and the field of research related to solar cells is known as photovoltaics.</p>\n<p>Solar cells have many applications. They have long been used in situations where electrical power from the grid is unavailable, such as in remote area power systems, Earth-orbiting satellites and space probes, handheld calculators, wrist watches, remote radiotelephones and water pumping applications. More recently, they are starting to be used in assemblies of solar modules (photovoltaic arrays) connected to the electricity grid through an inverter, that is not to act as a sole supply but as an additional electricity source.</p>\n<p>All solar cells require a light absorbing material contained within the cell structure to absorb photons and generate electrons via the photovoltaic effect. The materials used in solar cells tend to have the property of preferentially absorbing the wavelengths of solar light that reach the earth surface. However, some solar cells are optimized for light absorption beyond Earth's atmosphere as well.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Mortimer, Charles E. (1975).

  "title": "Alkali metal",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p>The <b>alkali metals</b> are a group in the periodic table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of the periodic table as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital. The alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterized homologous behaviour.</p>\n<p>The alkali metals have very similar properties: they are all shiny, soft, highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge +1. They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation. Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free element. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the alkali metals comprise the <b>group 1 elements</b>, excluding hydrogen (H), which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals. All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.</p>\n<p>All the discovered alkali metals occur in nature: in order of abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity and thus occurs only in traces due to its presence in natural decay chains. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.</p>\n<p>Most alkali metals have many different applications. Two of the most well-known applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium atomic clocks, of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time. A common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium-vapour lamp, which emits very efficient light. Table salt, or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. Sodium and potassium are also essential elements, having major biological roles as electrolytes, and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSeries of alkali metals, stored in mineral oil to prevent oxidation.

The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-videopayload=\"&lt;div class=&quot;mediaContainer&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;width:640px&quot;&gt;&lt;video id=&quot;mwe_player_1&quot; style=&quot;width:640px;height:480px&quot; poster=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Cesium_water.theora.ogv/640px--Cesium_water.theora.ogv.jpg&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;kskin&quot; data-durationhint=&quot;14.767891156463&quot; data-startoffset=&quot;0&quot; data-mwtitle=&quot;Cesium_water.theora.ogv&quot; data-mwprovider=&quot;wikimediacommons&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/9/9b/Cesium_water.theora.ogv/Cesium_water.theora.ogv.360p.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm; codecs=&amp;quot;vp8, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; transcodekey=&quot;360p.webm&quot; data-title=&quot;Web streamable WebM (360P)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;WebM 360P&quot; data-width=&quot;480&quot; data-height=&quot;360&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;321648&quot; data-framerate=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Cesium_water.theora.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg; codecs=&amp;quot;theora, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; data-title=&quot;Original Ogg file, 640 × 480 (475 kbps)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;Ogg source&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;480&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;474738&quot; data-framerate=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/9/9b/Cesium_water.theora.ogv/Cesium_water.theora.ogv.480p.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg; codecs=&amp;quot;theora, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; transcodekey=&quot;480p.ogv&quot; data-title=&quot;Web streamable Ogg video (480P)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;Ogg 480P&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;480&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;507664&quot; data-framerate=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/9/9b/Cesium_water.theora.ogv/Cesium_water.theora.ogv.480p.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm; codecs=&amp;quot;vp8, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; transcodekey=&quot;480p.webm&quot; data-title=&quot;Web streamable WebM (480P)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;WebM 480P&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;480&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;549632&quot; data-framerate=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.&lt;br /&gt;\nYou can &lt;a href=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Cesium_water.theora.ogv&quot;&gt;download the clip&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TimedMediaHandler/Client_download&quot;&gt;download a player&lt;/a&gt; to play the clip in your browser.&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCaesium reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>All the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. The second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus; thus, they almost always lose a single electron, forming cations. The alkalides are an exception: they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a −1 oxidation state, which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides, the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anions and were thought to be able to appear in salts only as cations. The alkalide anions have filled s-subshells, which gives them more stability and allows them to exist. All the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides, and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials. Alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides, which are salts with trapped electrons acting as anions. A particularly striking example of an alkalide is \"inverse sodium hydride\", HNa, as opposed to the usual sodium hydride, NaH: it is unstable in isolation, due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium, although several derivatives are predicted to be metastable or stable.</p>\n<p>The chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small Li cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character. Lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship: because of this, lithium has some similarities to magnesium. For example, lithium forms a stable nitride, a property common among all the alkaline earth metals (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals. In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form covalent organometallic compounds (e.g. LiMe and MgMe). Lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is not soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Francium is also predicted show some differences due to its high atomic weight, causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent. In contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low.</p>\n<h4>Compounds and reactions</h4>\n<h5>Reaction with water (alkali metal hydroxides)</h5>\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA reaction of 3 pounds (≈ 1.4 kg) of sodium with water</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>All the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water, producing an aqueous solution of the strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, of which there are two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).</p>\n<h5>Reaction with the group 14 elements</h5>\n<div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Lithium and sodium react with carbon to form acetylides, LiC and NaC, which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with acetylene. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium react with graphite; their atoms are intercalated between the hexagonal graphite layers, forming graphite intercalation compounds of formulae MC (dark grey, almost black), MC (dark grey, almost black), MC (blue), MC (steel blue), and MC (bronze) (M = K, Rb, or Cs). These compounds are over 200 times more electrically conductive than pure graphite, suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers (e.g. M+C−\n8). Upon heating of KC, the elimination of potassium atoms results in the conversion in sequence to KC, KC, KC and finally KC. KC is a very strong reducing agent and is pyrophoric and explodes on contact with water. While the large alkali metals (K, Rb, and Cs) initially form MC, the smaller ones initially form MC.</p>\n<p>When the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the carbon group, ionic substances with cage-like structures are formed, such as the silicide MSi (M = K, Rb, or Cs), which contains M and tetrahedral Si4−\n4 ions. The chemistry of alkali metal germanides, involving the germanide ion Ge and other cluster (Zintl) ions such as Ge2−\n4, Ge4−\n9, Ge2−\n9, and [(Ge)], is largely analogous to that of the corresponding silicides. Alkali metal stannides are mostly ionic, sometimes with the stannide ion (Sn), and sometimes with more complex Zintl ions such as Sn4−\n9, which appears in tetrapotassium nonastannide (KSn). The plumbide ion (Pb) is unknown; alkali metal plumbides have complex Zintl ions.</p>\n<h5>Reaction with the pnictogens (alkali metal pnictides)</h5>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUnit cell ball-and-stick model of lithium nitride</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Lithium, the lightest of the alkali metals, is the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen at standard conditions, and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride. Nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule (N) requires a lot of energy. The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal (forming M ions), the energy required to break the triple bond in N and the formation of N ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride. The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming ions with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic, forming lithium nitride. The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic, so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions. (Sodium nitride (NaN) and potassium nitride (KN), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions.)</p>\n<p>All the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula MPn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen). This is due to the greater size of the P and As ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known arsenides, with formulae KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, and KP. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of NaAs is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this is indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforward ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula MAs are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH). Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.</p>\n<h5>Reaction with the chalcogens (alkali metal chalcogenides)</h5>\n<div>See also: Alkali metal oxide</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>All the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen at standard conditions. They form various types of oxides, such as simple oxides (containing the O ion), peroxides (containing the O2−\n2 ion, where there is a single bond between the two oxygen atoms), superoxides (containing the O−\n2 ion), and many others. Lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide, but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide. Potassium forms a mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide, while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric (spontaneously catch fire in air).</p>\n<p>The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the more complex anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.) In addition, the small size of the Li and O ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful oxidizing agents. Sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in submarine air purifiers; the presence of water vapour, naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient.</p>\n<p>Rubidium and caesium can form even more complicated oxides than the superoxides. Rubidium can form RbO and RbO upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the ozonide CsO and several brightly coloured suboxides, such as Cs\n7O, Cs\n4O, Cs\n11O\n3, Cs\n3O (dark-green), CsO, Cs\n3O\n2, as well as Cs\n7O\n2. The latter may be heated under vacuum to generate Cs\n2O.</p>\n<p>The alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens (sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known (with the exception of francium's). Reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides, with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question. For example, sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide (NaS) and various polysulfides with the formula NaS (<i>x</i> from 2 to 6), containing the S2−\nx ions. Due to the basicity of the Se and Te ions, the alkali metal selenides and tellurides are alkaline in solution; when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium, alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the Se2−\nx and Te2−\nx ions. The alkali metal polonides are all ionic compounds containing the Po ion; they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around 300–400&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<h5>Reaction with hydrogen and the halogens (alkali metal hydrides and halides)</h5>\n<div>Main article: Alkali metal halide</div>\n<p>The alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens, forming salts known as the alkali metal halides. This includes sodium chloride, otherwise known as common salt. The reactivity becomes higher from lithium to caesium and drops from fluorine to iodine. All of the alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids. All the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li and F ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong. The alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides.</p>\n<h5>Coordination complexes</h5>\n<div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Alkali metal cations do not usually form coordination complexes with simple Lewis bases due to their low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes ([M(HO))]), with the exception of the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes ([Li(HO))]); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li, 15-crown-5 for Na, and 18-crown-6 for K) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.</p>\n<h5>Ammonia solutions</h5>\n<p>Unlike most metals, the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid ammonia, forming hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide (MNH, where M represents an alkali metal). The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. The colour is due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M) and alkali metal anions (M). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.</p>\n<h5>Organometallic chemistry</h5>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of the methyllithium tetramer, (CHLi)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Being the smallest alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, and tend to form oligomers with the structure (RLi) where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CHLi)), which exists in tetrameric (<i>x</i> = 4) and hexameric (<i>x</i> = 6) forms.</p>\n<p>The application of organosodium compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from organolithium compounds, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide. This reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium (KCHCHCH). cis-2-Butene and trans-2-butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas isomerization is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the higher alkali metals. The higher alkali metals also favor the sterically congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.</p>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<p>The alkali metals are all silver-coloured except for caesium, which has a golden tint. All are soft and have low densities, melting points, and boiling points.</p>\n<p>The table below is a summary of the key physical and atomic properties of the alkali metals. Data marked with question marks are either uncertain or are estimations partially based on periodic trends rather than observations.</p>\n\n<h4>Periodic trends</h4>\n<div>See also: Periodic trends</div>\n<p>The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.</p>\n<h5>Atomic and ionic radii</h5>\n<div>Main article: Atomic radius</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEffective nuclear charge on an atomic electron</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>The atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom has more than one electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.</p>\n<p>The ionic radii of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the effective nuclear charge has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h5>First ionisation energy</h5>\n<div>Main article: Ionisation energy</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPeriodic trend for ionisation energy: each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the noble gases.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>The first ionisation energy of an element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge +1. The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge, the amount of shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in main group elements. The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels. Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feel the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases. (This trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations. This makes francium's outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus, increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium.)</p>\n<p>The second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second-most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled electron shell and is thus difficult to remove.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h5>Reactivity</h5>\n<div>Main article: Reactivity (chemistry)</div>\n<p>The reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group. This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h5>Electronegativity</h5>\n<div>Main article: Electronegativity</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe variation of Pauling electronegativity (y-axis) as one descends the main groups of the periodic table from the second to the sixth period</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>Electronegativity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them.</p>\n<p>Because of the higher electronegativity of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h5>Melting and boiling points</h5>\n<div>Main articles: Melting point and Boiling point</div>\n<div>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>The melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance (in liquid state) is the point where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas. As a metal is heated to its melting point, the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point. Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group. This is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons. As the atoms increase in size going down the group (because their atomic radius increases), the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil, thus lowering the melting and boiling points. (The increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect.)</p>\n<div></div>\n<h5>Density</h5>\n<div>Main article: Density</div>\n<div>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>The alkali metals all have the same crystal structure (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Nuclear</h3>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers; hence, their isotopes must be either odd-odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or odd-even (proton number is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd-odd nuclei have even mass numbers, while odd-even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd-odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd-odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay, because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.</p>\n<p>Due to the great rarity of odd-odd nuclei, almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd-even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since there is not a difference in binding energy between even-odd and odd-even comparable to that between even-even and odd-odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. Beryllium is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.</p>\n<p>All of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of francium are radioactive. Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925.</p>\n<p>Caesium-137, with a half-life of 30.17&nbsp;years, is one of the two principal medium-lived fission products, along with strontium-90, which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the Chernobyl accident. Cs undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium-137. It is a strong emitter of gamma radiation. Cs has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way, but must be allowed to decay. Cs has been used as a tracer in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of H. Small amounts of caesium-134 and caesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents, most notably the Goiânia accident and the Chernobyl disaster. As of 2005, caesium-137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.</p>\n<h2>Extensions</h2>\n<div>See also: Ununennium</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEmpirical (Na–Cs, Mg–Ra) and predicted (Fr–Uhp, Ubn–Uhh) atomic radius of the alkali and alkaline earth metals from the third to the ninth period, measured in angstroms</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered, there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties. Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0&nbsp;°C and 30&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEmpirical (Na–Fr) and predicted (Uue) electron affinity of the alkali metals from the third to the eighth period, measured in electron volts</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240&nbsp;pm, very close to that of rubidium (247&nbsp;pm), so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb, because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkali metal, in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEmpirical (Na–Fr, Mg–Ra) and predicted (Uue–Uhp, Ubn–Uhh) ionisation energy of the alkali and alkaline earth metals from the third to the ninth period, measured in electron volts</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium. Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 169, unhexennium, under ununennium, Dirac-Fock calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually be element 165, unhexpentium, which is predicted to have the electron configuration [Uuo] 5g 6f 7d 8s 8p 9s. Further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium, having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium, and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium, having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium. However, the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron, possibly allowing oxidation states beyond +1 and perhaps even making unhexpentium behave more like a boron group element than an alkali metal.</p>\n<p>The probable properties of the alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of 2012. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers. Due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being s-block elements, these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly apply to the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium (Ubn) and unhexhexium (Uhh).</p>\n<h2>Other similar substances</h2>\n<h3>Hydrogen</h3>\n<div>Main article: Hydrogen</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHydrogen gas glowing in a discharge tube</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The element hydrogen, with one electron per neutral atom, is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal; when it is considered to be an alkali metal, it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule (H); however, the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules (such as dilithium, Li) at high temperatures, when they are in the gaseous state.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen, like the alkali metals, has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogens, but the similarities end there. Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration and not its chemical properties. It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties.</p>\n<p>The first ionisation energy of hydrogen (1312.0 kJ/mol) is much higher than that of the alkali metals. As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion, and is sometimes considered to be a halogen. (The alkali metals can also form negative ions, known as alkalides, but these are little more than laboratory curiosities, being unstable.) Under extremely high pressures, such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; in this phase, it is known as metallic hydrogen.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMendeleev's 1869 periodic table shows thallium (Tl) as an alkali metal.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Ammonium</h3>\n<div>Main article: Ammonium</div>\n<p>The ammonium ion (NH+\n4) has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals, acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium, and is often considered a close relative. For example, most alkali metal salts are soluble in water, a property which ammonium salts share. Ammonium is expected to behave as a metal (NH+\n4 ions in a sea of electrons) at very high pressures, such as inside the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.</p>\n<h3>Thallium</h3>\n<div>Main article: Thallium</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nVery pure thallium pieces in a glass ampoule, stored under argon gas</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Thallium displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl (164&nbsp;pm), K (152&nbsp;pm) and Ag (129&nbsp;pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 periodic table. (Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table and Meyer's 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and leave the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n\n<h3>Etymology</h3>\n\n<p>The alkali metals are so called because their hydroxides are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water.</p>\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n<h4>Lithium</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPetalite, the lithium mineral from which lithium was first isolated</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Petalite (LiAlSiO) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist José Bonifácio de Andrada in a mine on the island of Utö, Sweden. However, it was not until 1817 that Johan August Arfwedson, then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore. This new element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium, though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals. Berzelius gave the unknown material the name \"<i>lithion</i>/<i>lithina</i>\", from the Greek word <i>λιθoς</i> (transliterated as <i>lithos</i>, meaning \"stone\"), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and sodium, which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood. He named the metal inside the material \"<i>lithium</i>\".</p>\n<h4>Sodium</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCaustic soda (sodium hydroxide), the sodium compound from which sodium was first isolated</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Sodium compounds have been known since ancient times; salt (sodium chloride) has been an important commodity in human activities, as testified by the English word <i>salary</i>, referring to <i>salarium</i>, the wafers of salt sometimes given to Roman soldiers along with their other wages. In medieval Europe a compound of sodium with the Latin name of <i>sodanum</i> was used as a headache remedy. Pure sodium was not isolated until 1807 by Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of caustic soda (now called sodium hydroxide), a very similar method to the one used to isolate potassium earlier that year.</p>\n<h4>Potassium</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCaustic potash (potassium hydroxide), the potassium compound from which potassium was first isolated</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. Pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later that same year, Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda (NaOH, lye) by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different.</p>\n<h4>Rubidium</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLepidolite, the rubidium mineral from which rubidium was first isolated</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Rubidium was discovered in 1861 in Heidelberg, Germany by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, the first people to suggest finding new elements by spectrum analysis, in the mineral lepidolite through the use of a spectroscope. Because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word <i>rubidus</i>, meaning dark red or bright red. Rubidium's discovery succeeded that of caesium, also discovered by Bunsen and Kirchhoff through spectroscopy.</p>\n<h4>Caesium</h4>\n<p>In 1860, Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered caesium in the mineral water from Dürkheim, Germany. Due to the bright-blue lines in its emission spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word <i>caesius</i>, meaning sky-blue. Caesium was the first element to be discovered spectroscopically, only one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.</p>\n<h4>Francium</h4>\n<p>There were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, France discovered francium in 1939 by purifying a sample of actinium-227, which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220&nbsp;keV. However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80&nbsp;keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the alpha decay of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure that she later revised to 1%. It was the last element discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis.</p>\n<h4>Eka-francium</h4>\n<div>See also: Extended periodic table</div>\n<p>The next element below francium (eka-francium) is very likely to be ununennium (Uue), element 119, although this is not completely certain due to relativistic effects. The synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium-254 with calcium-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California. No atoms were identified, leading to a limiting yield of 300 nb.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>254\n99Es + 48\n20Ca → 302\n119Uue* → <i>no atoms</i></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of Es, which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms, to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories. However, given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions; indeed, another attempt to synthesise ununennium by bombarding a berkelium target with titanium ions is under way at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet, and it is also possible, due to drip instabilities, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible. No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals, such as unhexpentium, due to their extremely high atomic number.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<h3>In the Solar System</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEstimated abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar system. Hydrogen and helium are most common, from the Big Bang. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium, and boron) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The Oddo-Harkins rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers, with the exception of hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another, thus increasing their atomic number. In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability. All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them (the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals) in the Solar System. The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesized in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesized in both Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple-alpha process, fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon, and skipping over those three elements.</p>\n<h3>On Earth</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSpodumene, an important lithium mineral</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The Earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system. In turn, the natural history of the Earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98×10&nbsp;kg. It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass segregation, the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.</p>\n<p>The alkali metals, due to their high reactivity, do not occur naturally in pure form in nature. They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements due to their low ionic radii.</p>\n<p>Sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth, both being among the ten most common elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and zeolite.</p>\n<p>Lithium, due to its relatively low reactivity, can be found in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 micromolar.</p>\n<p>Rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.</p>\n<p>Francium-223, the only naturally occurring isotope of francium, is the product of the alpha decay of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals. In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 10 uranium atoms. It has been calculated that there is at most 30&nbsp;g of francium in the earth's crust at any time, due to its extremely short half-life of 22 minutes.</p>\n<h2>Production and isolation</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>Salt flats are rich in lithium, such as these in Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina (left) and Uyuni, Bolivia (right). The lithium-rich brine is concentrated by pumping it into solar evaporation ponds (visible in Argentina image).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The production of pure alkali metals is difficult due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. The alkali metals are so reactive that they cannot be displaced by other elements and must be isolated through high-energy methods such as electrolysis.</p>\n<p>Lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs, brine pools, and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride.</p>\n<p>Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as sylvite (potassium chloride). It is occasionally produced through separating the potassium from the chlorine in potassium chloride, but is more often produced through electrolysis of potassium hydroxide, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from seawater. Sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed, but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700&nbsp;°C through the use of a Downs cell. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThis sample of uraninite contains about 100,000 atoms (3.3×10&nbsp;g) of francium-223 at any given time.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>For several years in the 1950s and 1960s, a by-product of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the Tanco Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from pollucite. Today, a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO)·12HO, which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 different reactions. The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Caesium, however, is not produced from the above reaction. Instead, the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium, extracted from the ore mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.</p>\n<p>Francium-223, the only naturally occurring isotope of francium, is produced naturally as the product of the alpha decay of actinium-227. Francium can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals; it has been calculated that at most there are 30&nbsp;g of francium in the earth's crust at any given time. As a result of its extreme rarity in nature, most francium is synthesized in the nuclear reaction Au + O → Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211. The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300,000 neutral atoms, which were synthesized using the nuclear reaction given above.</p>\n<p>From their silicate ores, all the alkali metals may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated through electrolysis.</p>\n<p>Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>All of the discovered alkali metals excluding francium have many applications. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium can also be used to make lubricating greases, air treatment, and aluminium production.</p>\n<p>Pure sodium has many applications, including use in sodium-vapour lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, and can help smooth the surface of other metals. Sodium compounds have many applications as well, the most well-known compound being table salt. Sodium is also used in soap as salts of fatty acids.</p>\n<p>Potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition. Other potassium ions are often used to hold anions. Potassium hydroxide is a very strong base, and is used to control the pH of various substances.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFOCS 1, a caesium atomic clock in Switzerland</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate; if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second. Rubidium ions are often used in purple fireworks, and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.</p>\n<p>Francium has no commercial applications, but because of francium's relatively simple atomic structure, among other things, it has been used in spectroscopy experiments, leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels, similar to those predicted by quantum theory.</p>\n<h2>Biological role and precautions</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLithium carbonate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2&nbsp;grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.</p>\n<p>Sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems, generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells. Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500&nbsp;milligrams per day. Sodium chloride (also known as common salt) is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods. The DRI for sodium is 1.5&nbsp;grams per day, but most people in the United States consume more than 2.3&nbsp;grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.</p>\n<p>Potassium is the major cation (positive ion) inside animal cells, while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells. The concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells, known as the membrane potential. The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane. The cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential—a \"spike\" of electrical discharge. The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA wheel type radiotherapy device which has a long collimator to focus the radiation into a narrow beam. The caesium-137 chloride radioactive source is the blue square, and gamma rays are represented by the beam emerging from the aperture. This was the radiation source involved in the Goiânia accident, containing about 93&nbsp;grams of caesium-137 chloride.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency. Caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic because of chemical similarity of caesium to potassium, allowing the caesium to replace the potassium in the body, causing potassium deficiency. Exposure to large amounts of caesium compounds can cause hyperirritability and spasms, but as such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources, caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant. The median lethal dose (LD) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3&nbsp;g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment. Radioisotopes of caesium require special precautions: the improper handling of caesium-137 gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of Goiânia, Brazil, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health.</p>\n<p>Francium has no biological role and is most likely to be toxic due to its extreme radioactivity, causing radiation poisoning, but since the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300,000 neutral atoms, it is unlikely that most people will ever encounter francium.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ The symbol Na for sodium is derived from its Latin name, natrium; this is still the name for the element in some languages, such as German and Russian.

  "title": "Beryllium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Beryllium</b> is the chemical element with the symbol <b>Be</b> and atomic number 4. Because any beryllium synthesized in stars is short-lived, it is a relatively rare element in both the universe and in the crust of the Earth. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.</p>\n<p>Beryllium increases hardness and resistance to corrosion when alloyed with aluminium, cobalt, copper (notably beryllium copper), iron and nickel. In structural applications, high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium a quality aerospace material for high-speed aircraft, missiles, space vehicles and communication satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and in particle physics experiments. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in heat transport and heat sinking applications.</p>\n<p>The commercial use of beryllium presents technical challenges due to the toxicity (especially by inhalation) of beryllium-containing dusts. Beryllium is corrosive to tissue, and can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease called berylliosis in some people. The element is not known to be necessary or useful for either plant or animal life.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Beryllium is a steel gray and hard metal that is brittle at room temperature and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional flexural rigidity (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9&nbsp;km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg·K) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m·K), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10 K), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear properties</h3>\n<p>Natural beryllium, save for slight contamination by cosmogenic radioisotopes, is essentially beryllium-9, which has a nuclear spin of 3/2-. Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 barns for energies above ~0.01 MeV. Therefore, it works as a neutron reflector and neutron moderator, effectively slowing the neutrons to the thermal energy range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower – exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.</p>\n<p>The single primordial beryllium isotope Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1.9 MeV, to produce Be, which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles. Thus, for high-energy neutrons beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs. This nuclear reaction is:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>9\n4Be + n → 2(4\n2He) + 2n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Neutrons are liberated when beryllium nuclei are struck by energetic alpha particles producing the nuclear reaction</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>9\n4Be + 4\n2He → 12\n6C + n , where 4\n2He is an alpha particle and 12\n6C is a carbon-12 nucleus.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Beryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope-powered nuclear reaction neutron sources for the laboratory production of free neutrons.</p>\n<p>As a metal, beryllium is transparent to most wavelengths of X-rays and gamma rays, making it useful for the output windows of X-ray tubes and other such apparatus.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes and nucleosynthesis</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Isotopes of beryllium and beryllium-10</div>\n<p>Both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but these do not last long. It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust. Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPlot showing variations in solar activity, including variation in sunspot number (red) and Be concentration (blue). Note that the beryllium scale is inverted, so increases on this scale indicate lower Be levels</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Radioactive cosmogenic Be is produced in the atmosphere of the Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites. The isotope Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots, much like Be.</p>\n<p>Be has a very short half-life of about 7×10&nbsp;s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the Big Bang. This is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang's nucleosynthesis phase to produce carbon by the fusion of He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available beryllium-8. The British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle first showed that the energy levels of Be and C allow carbon production by the so-called triple-alpha process in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available. This process allows carbon to be produced in stars, but not in the Big Bang. Star-created carbon (the basis of carbon-based life) is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by AGB stars and supernovae (see also Big Bang nucleosynthesis), as well as the creation of all other elements with atomic numbers larger than that of carbon.</p>\n<p>The innermost electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding. Therefore, when Be decays by electron capture, it does so by taking electrons from atomic orbitals that may participate in bonding. This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its electron configuration&nbsp;– a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.</p>\n<p>The shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is Be which decays through neutron emission. It has a half-life of 2.7&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 s. Be is also very short-lived with a half-life of 5.0&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 s. The exotic isotopes Be and Be are known to exhibit a nuclear halo. This phenomenon can be understood as the nuclei of Be and Be have, respectively, 1 and 4 neutrons orbiting substantially outside the classical Fermi 'waterdrop' model of the nucleus.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBeryllium ore</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEmerald is a naturally occurring compound of beryllium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Beryllium has a concentration of 2 to 6 parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust. The Sun has a concentration of 0.1 parts per billion (ppb) of beryllium. It is most concentrated in the soils, 6 ppm, and is found in 0.2 parts per trillion (ppt) of sea water. Trace amounts of Be are found in the Earth's atmosphere. In sea water, beryllium is exceedingly rare, comprising only 0.0006 ppb by weight. In stream water, however, beryllium is more abundant with 0.1 ppb by weight.</p>\n<p>Beryllium is found in over 100 minerals, but most are uncommon to rare. The more common beryllium containing minerals include: bertrandite (BeSiO(OH)), beryl (AlBeSiO), chrysoberyl (AlBeO) and phenakite (BeSiO). Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine, red beryl and emerald. The green color in gem-quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium (about 2% for emerald).</p>\n<p>The two main ores of beryllium, beryl and bertrandite, are found in Argentina, Brazil, India, Madagascar, Russia and the United States. Total world reserves of beryllium ore are greater than 400,000 tonnes.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>The extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed. The United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial scale extraction of beryllium.</p>\n<p>Beryllium is most-commonly extracted from beryl, which is either sintered using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture. The sintering process involves mixing beryl with sodium fluorosilicate and soda at 770&nbsp;°C to form sodium fluoroberyllate, aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide. Beryllium hydroxide is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium hydroxide in water. Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to 1,650&nbsp;°C. The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated 250 to 300&nbsp;°C in concentrated sulfuric acid, mostly yielding beryllium sulfate and aluminium sulfate. Aqueous ammonia is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur, leaving beryllium hydroxide.</p>\n<p>Beryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into beryllium fluoride or beryllium chloride. To form the fluoride, aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate, which is heated to 1,000°C to form beryllium fluoride. Heating the fluoride to 900&nbsp;°C with magnesium forms finely divided beryllium and additional heating to 1,300&nbsp;°C creates the compact metal. Heating beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide which becomes beryllium chloride when mixed with carbon and chloride. Electrolysis of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal.</p>\n<h2>Chemical properties</h2>\n<div>See also category: Beryllium compounds</div>\n<p>Beryllium's chemical behavior is largely a result of its small atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent. It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio. An oxide layer forms around beryllium that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000&nbsp;°C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming a mixture of beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted HSO, but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBeryllium hydrolysis as a function of pH<br>\nWater molecules attached to Be are omitted</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The beryllium atom has the electronic configuration [He] 2s. The two valence electrons give beryllium a +2 oxidation state and thus the ability to form two covalent bonds; the only evidence of lower valence of beryllium is in the solubility of the metal in BeCl. Due to the octet rule, atoms tend to seek a valence of 8 in order to resemble a noble gas. Beryllium tries to achieve a coordination number of 4 because its two covalent bonds fill half of this octet. A coordination of 4 allows beryllium compounds, such as the fluoride or chloride, to form polymers.</p>\n<p>This characteristic is employed in analytical techniques using EDTA as a ligand. EDTA preferentially forms octahedral complexes&nbsp;– thus absorbing other cations such as Al which might interfere – for example, in the solvent extraction of a complex formed between Be and acetylacetone. Beryllium(II) readily forms complexes with strong donating ligands such as phosphine oxides and arsine oxides. There have been extensive studies of these complexes which show the stability of the O-Be bond.</p>\n<p>Solutions of beryllium salts, e.g. beryllium sulfate and beryllium nitrate, are acidic because of hydrolysis of the [Be(HO)] ion.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>[Be(HO)] + HO  [Be(HO)(OH)] + HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Other products of hydrolysis include the trimeric ion [Be(OH)(HO)]. Beryllium hydroxide, Be(OH), is insoluble even in acidic solutions with pH less than 6, that is at biological pH. It is amphoteric and dissolves in strongly alkaline solutions.</p>\n<p>Beryllium forms binary compounds with many non-metals. Anhydrous halides are known for F, Cl, Br and I. BeF has a silica-like structure with corner-shared BeF tetrahedra. BeCl and BeBr have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra. All beryllium halides have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase.</p>\n<p>Beryllium difluoride, BeF, is different than the other difluorides. In general, beryllium has a tendency to bond covalently, much more so than the other alkaline earths and its fluoride is partially covalent (although still more ionic than its other halides). BeF has many similarities to SiO (quartz) a mostly covalently bonded network solid. BeF has tetrahedrally coordinated metal and forms glasses (is difficult to crystallize). When crystalline, beryllium fluoride has the same room temperature crystal structure as quartz and shares many higher temperature structures also. Beryllium difluoride is very soluble in water, unlike the other alkaline earths. (Although they are strongly ionic, they do not dissolve because of the especially strong lattice energy of the fluorite structure.) However, BeF has much lower electrical conductivity when in solution or when molten than would be expected if it were fully ionic.</p>\n\n<p>Beryllium oxide, BeO, is a white refractory solid, which has the wurtzite crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as in some metals. BeO is amphoteric. Salts of beryllium can be produced by treating Be(OH) with acid. Beryllium sulfide, selenide and telluride are known, all having the zincblende structure.</p>\n<p>Beryllium nitride, BeN is a high-melting-point compound which is readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN is known and beryllium phosphide, BeP has a similar structure to BeN. Basic beryllium nitrate and basic beryllium acetate have similar tetrahedral structures with four beryllium atoms coordinated to a central oxide ion. A number of beryllium borides are known, such as BeB, BeB, BeB, BeB, BeB and BeB. Beryllium carbide, BeC, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane. No beryllium silicide has been identified.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The mineral beryl, which contains beryllium, has been used at least since the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. In the first century CE, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder mentioned in his encyclopedia <i>Natural History</i> that beryl and emerald (\"smaragdus\") were similar. The Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis, written in the third or fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLouis-Nicolas Vauquelin discovered beryllium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Early analyses of emeralds and beryls by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, Torbern Olof Bergman, Franz Karl Achard, and Johann Jakob Bindheim always yielded similar elements, leading to the fallacious conclusion that both substances are aluminium silicates. Mineralogist René Just Haüy discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical, and he asked chemist Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin for a chemical analysis.</p>\n<p>In a 1798 paper read before the Institut de France, Vauquelin reported that he found a new \"earth\" by dissolving aluminium hydroxide from emerald and beryl in an additional alkali. The editors of the journal <i>Annales de Chimie et de Physique</i> named the new earth \"glucine\" for the sweet taste of some of its compounds. Klaproth preferred the name \"beryllina\" due to fact that yttria also formed sweet salts. The name \"beryllium\" was first used by Wöhler in 1828.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFriedrich Wöhler was one of the men who independently isolated beryllium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Friedrich Wöhler and Antoine Bussy independently isolated beryllium in 1828 by the chemical reaction of metallic potassium with beryllium chloride, as follows:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>BeCl + 2 K → 2 KCl + Be</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Using an alcohol lamp, Wöhler heated alternating layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder he saw that it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster. The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the electrolysis of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.</p>\n<p>The direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride by Paul Lebeau in 1898 resulted in the first pure (99.5 to 99.8%) samples of beryllium. The first commercially-successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1932 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt. Their process involves the electrolysation of a mixture of beryllium fluorides and barium, which causes molten beryllium to collect on a water-cooled iron cathode.</p>\n<p>A sample of beryllium was bombarded with alpha rays from the decay of radium in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered the existence of the neutron. This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory neutron sources that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.</p>\n<p>Beryllium production saw a rapid increase during World War II, due to the rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights. Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic.</p>\n<p>Electrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.</p>\n<p>Pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified magnesium. The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.</p>\n<p>Between 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 tonnes, of which 176 tonnes (88%) came from the United States.</p>\n<h3>Etymology</h3>\n<p>Early usage of the word <i>beryllium</i> can be traced to many languages, including Latin <i>Beryllus</i>; French <i>Béry</i>; Greek <i>βήρυλλος</i>, <i>bērullos</i>, <i>beryl</i>; Prakrit <i>veruliya</i> (वॆरुलिय‌); Pāli <i>veḷuriya</i> (वेलुरिय), <i>veḷiru</i> (भेलिरु) or <i>viḷar</i> (भिलर्) – \"to become pale\", in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl. The original source is probably the Sanskrit word वैडूर्य vaidurya-, which is of Dravidian origin and could be derived from the name of the modern city of Belur. For about 160 years, beryllium was also known as  <b>glucinum</b> or <b>glucinium</b> (with the accompanying chemical symbol \"<b>Gl</b>\",), the name coming from the Greek word for sweet: γλυκυς, due to the sweet taste of beryllium salts.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>It is estimated that most beryllium is used for military applications, so information is not readily available.</p>\n<h3>Radiation windows</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBeryllium target which \"converts\" a proton beam into a neutron beam</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA square beryllium foil mounted in a steel case to be used as a window between a vacuum chamber and an X-ray microscope. Beryllium is highly transparent to X-rays owing to its low atomic number.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Because of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X-rays, the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100 eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.</p>\n<p>Low atomic number also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore it is used to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the Tevatron and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.</p>\n<h3>Mechanical applications</h3>\n<p>Because of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, space vehicles, and satellites. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium. Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized. A small number of bicycle frames were built with beryllium, at \"astonishing\" prices. From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons. The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.</p>\n<p>Mixing about 2.0% beryllium into copper forms an alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as its good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to a significant increase in oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBeryllium Copper Adjustable Wrench</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation, e.g. in inertial guidance systems and in the support mechanisms for optical systems. Beryllium-copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in \"Jason pistols\", which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships.</p>\n<p>An earlier major application of beryllium was in brakes for military airplanes because of its hardness, high melting point, and exceptional ability to dissipate heat. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.</p>\n<p>To reduce costs, beryllium can be alloyed with significant amounts of aluminium, resulting in the AlBeMet alloy (a trade name). This blend is cheaper than pure beryllium, while still retaining many desirable properties.</p>\n<h3>Mirrors</h3>\n<p>Beryllium mirrors are of particular interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.</p>\n<p>The James Webb Space Telescope will have 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST will face a temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures. For the same reason, the optics of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal.</p>\n<h3>Magnetic applications</h3>\n<p>Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of beryllium are used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated by them. In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear applications</h3>\n<p>Thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in nuclear weapon designs as the very outer layer of the plutonium pits in the primary stages of thermonuclear bombs, placed to surround the fissile material. These layers of beryllium are good \"pushers\" for the implosion of the plutonium-239, and they are also good neutron reflectors, just as they are in beryllium-moderated nuclear reactors.</p>\n<p>Beryllium is also commonly used in some neutron sources in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor, or a particle accelerator-powered neutron generator). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a radioisotope such as polonium-210, radium-226, plutonium-239, or americium-241. In the nuclear reaction that occurs, a beryllium nucleus is transmuted into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading. Such alpha decay driven beryllium neutron sources, named \"urchin\" neutron initiators, were used some in early atomic bombs. Neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with gamma rays from a gamma decay radioisotope, are also used to produce laboratory neutrons.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTwo CANDU fuel bundles: Each about 50&nbsp;cm in length and 10&nbsp;cm in diameter. Notice the small appendages on the fuel clad surfaces</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Beryllium is also used in fuel fabrication for CANDU reactors. The fuel elements have small appendages that are resistance brazed to the fuel cladding using an induction brazing process with Be as the braze filler material. Bearing pads are brazed on to prevent fuel bundle to pressure tube contact, and inter-element spacer pads are brazed on to prevent element to element contact.</p>\n<p>Beryllium is also used at the Joint European Torus nuclear-fusion research laboratory, and it will be used in the more advanced ITER to condition the components which face the plasma. Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties. Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs.</p>\n<h3>Acoustics</h3>\n<p>Low weight and high rigidity of beryllium make it useful as a material for high-frequency speaker drivers. Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than titanium), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium tweeters are limited to high-end home, pro audio, and public address applications. Due to the high performance of beryllium in acoustics, for marketing purposes some products are claimed to be made of the material when they are not.</p>\n<h3>Electronic</h3>\n<p>Beryllium is a p-type dopant in III-V compound semiconductors. It is widely used in materials such as GaAs, AlGaAs, InGaAs and InAlAs grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Cross-rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for printed circuit boards in surface-mount technology. In critical electronic applications, beryllium is both a structural support and heat sink. The application also requires a coefficient of thermal expansion that is well matched to the alumina and polyimide-glass substrates. The beryllium-beryllium oxide composite \"E-Materials\" have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials.</p>\n<p>Beryllium oxide is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<div>Main article: Beryllium poisoning</div>\n<p>Approximately 35&nbsp;micrograms of beryllium is found in the human body, but this amount is not considered harmful. Beryllium is chemically similar to magnesium and therefore can displace it from enzymes, which causes them to malfunction. Chronic berylliosis is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium; either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment. Symptoms of the disease can take up to 5 years to develop; about a third of patients with it die and the survivors are left disabled. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) lists beryllium and beryllium compounds as Category 1 carcinogens.</p>\n<p>Acute beryllium disease in the form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.</p>\n<p>Early researchers tasted beryllium and its various compounds for sweetness in order to verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt should be made to ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.</p>\n<p>A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).</p>"

  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Boron (disambiguation).</div>\n<div>Not to be confused with borium, a tungsten carbide product.</div>\n\n<p><b>Boron</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>B</b> and atomic number&nbsp;5. Because boron is produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in both the solar system and the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite.</p>\n<p>Chemically uncombined boron, which is classed as a metalloid, is not found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty, as boron tends to form refractory materials containing small amounts of carbon or other elements. Several allotropes of boron exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder and crystalline boron is black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor conductor at room temperature. Elemental boron is used as a dopant in the semiconductor industry.</p>\n<p>The major industrial-scale uses of boron compounds are in sodium perborate bleaches, and the borax component of fiberglass insulation. Boron polymers and ceramics play specialized roles as high-strength lightweight structural and refractory materials. Boron compounds are used in silica-based glasses and ceramics to give them resistance to thermal shock. Boron-containing reagents are used as intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used, or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.</p>\n<p>In biology, borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods and are used as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and a natural boron-containing organic antibiotic is known. Boron is essential to life. Small amounts of boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron necessary in soils. Experiments indicate a role for boron as an ultratrace element in animals, but its role in animal physiology is unknown.</p>\n\n<h2>History and etymology</h2>\n<p>The name boron originates from the Arabic word <i>بورق</i> <i>buraq</i> or the Persian word <i>بوره</i> <i>burah</i>; which are names for the mineral borax.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSassolite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Boron compounds were known thousands of years ago. Borax was known from the deserts of western Tibet, where it received the name of <i>tincal</i>, derived from the Sanskrit. Borax glazes were used in China from AD300, and some tincal even reached the West, where the Persian alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān seems to mention it in AD700. Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was recognized in the hot springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, and became known as <i>sal sedativum</i>, with mainly medical uses. The rare mineral is called sassolite, which is found at Sasso, Italy. Sasso was the main source of European borax from 1827 to 1872, at which date American sources replaced it. Boron compounds were relatively rarely used chemicals until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized these compounds and made them in volume and hence cheap.</p>\n<p>Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate on one of the electrodes. In his subsequent experiments he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element <i>boracium</i>. Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. They showed by oxidizing boron with air that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron. Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as an element in 1824. Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Allotropes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Allotropes of boron</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBoron chunks</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Boron is similar to carbon in its capability to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks. Even nominally disordered (amorphous) boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are, however, bonded randomly to each other without long-range order. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a high melting point of above 2000&nbsp;°C. It exists in four major polymorphs: α, β, γ and T. Whereas α, β and T phases are based on B icosahedra, the γ-phase can be described as a rocksalt-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B atomic pairs. It can be produced by compressing other boron phases to 12–20&nbsp;GPa and heating to 1500–1800&nbsp;°C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. The T phase is produced at similar pressures, but higher temperatures of 1800–2200&nbsp;°C. As to the α and β phases, they might both coexist at ambient conditions with the β phase being more stable. Compressing boron above 160&nbsp;GPa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure, and this phase is a superconductor at temperatures 6–12 K.</p>\n\n<h3>Chemistry of the element</h3>\n<div>See also category: Boron compounds</div>\n<p>Elemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the material is extremely difficult to prepare. Most studies on \"boron\" involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. Chemically, boron behaves more similarly to silicon than to aluminium. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated hydrogen peroxide, hot concentrated nitric acid, hot sulfuric acid or hot mixture of sulfuric and chromic acids.</p>\n<p>The rate of oxidation of boron depends upon the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature. Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form boron trioxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 B + 3 O → 2 BO</dd>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBall-and-stick model of tetraborate anion, [BO(OH)], as it occurs in crystalline borax, Na[BO(OH)]·8HO. Boron atoms are pink, with bridging oxygens in red, and four hydroxyl hydrogens in white. Note two borons are trigonally bonded sp with no formal charge, while the other two borons are tetrahedrally bonded sp, each carrying a formal charge of −1. The oxidation state of all borons is III. This mixture of boron coordination numbers and formal charges is characteristic of natural boron minerals.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Boron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides, for example,</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 B + 3 Br → 2 BBr</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The trichloride in practice is usually made from the oxide.</p>\n<h4>Chemical compounds</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBoron (III) trifluoride structure, showing \"empty\" boron p orbital in pi-type coordinate covalent bonds</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In its most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.</p>\n<p>The trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are Lewis acids in that they readily form adducts with electron-pair donors, which are called Lewis bases. For example, fluoride (F) and boron trifluoride (BF) combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion, BF. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form boric acid.</p>\n<p>Boron is found in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often associated with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate centers is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na) in borax.</p>\n<div>Main article: Boron nitride</div>\n<p>The boron nitrides are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt. They adopt structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure called cubic boron nitride (tradename Borazon), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds can be viewed as a coordinate covalent bond, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acidic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively-charged boron and negatively-charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.</p>\n<h5>Organoboron chemistry</h5>\n<div>Main article: Organoboron chemistry</div>\n<p>A large number of organoboron compounds are known and many are useful in organic synthesis. Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, tetraphenylborate (B(CH)) vs triphenylborane (B(CH)). Many are produced from hydroboration, which employs diborane (BH).</p>\n<h5>Compounds of B(I) and B(II)</h5>\n<p>Although these are not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N, is not isolable in condensed form, but BF and BCl are well characterized.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBall-and-stick model of superconductor magnesium diboride. Boron atoms lie in hexagonal aromatic graphite-like layers, with a charge of −1 per boron. Magnesium (II) ions lie between layers</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Binary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, contain boron in oxidation state less than III. Illustrative is magnesium diboride (MgB). Each boron atom has a formal −1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of 2+. In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar, with an extra double bond for each boron, with the boron atoms forming sheets akin to the carbon in graphite. However, unlike the case with hexagonal boron nitride which by comparison lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in the plane of magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite. In addition, in 2001 this material was found to be a high-temperature superconductor.</p>\n<p>Certain other metal borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools.</p>\n<p>From the structural perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included in this series are the cluster compounds dodecaborate (BH), decaborane (BH), and the carboranes such as CBH. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of boron</div>\n<p>Boron has two naturally occurring and stable isotopes, B (80.1%) and B (19.9%). The mass difference results in a wide range of δB values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the B and B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH) and [B(OH)]. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during HO phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the [B(OH)] ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in B(OH) and therefore may be responsible for the large B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature. The exotic B exhibits a nuclear halo, i.e. its radius is appreciably larger than that predicted by the liquid drop model.</p>\n<p>The B isotope is good at capturing thermal neutrons (see neutron cross section#Typical cross sections). Natural boron is about 20% B and 80% B. The nuclear industry enriches natural boron to nearly pure B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure B.</p>\n<h4>Commercial isotope enrichment</h4>\n<p>Because of its high neutron cross-section, boron-10 is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron-capturing substance. Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed, however only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the dimethyl ether adduct of boron trifluoride (DME-BF) and column chromatography of borates are being used.</p>\n<h4>Enriched boron (boron-10)</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNeutron cross section of boron (top curve is for B and bottom curve for B)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Enriched boron or B is used in both radiation shielding and is the primary nuclide used in neutron capture therapy of cancer. In the latter (\"boron neutron capture therapy\" or BNCT), a compound containing B is incorporated into a pharmaceutical which is selectively taken up by a malignant tumor and tissues near it. The patient is then treated with a beam of low energy neutrons at a relatively low neutron radiation dose. The neutrons, however, trigger energetic and short-range secondary alpha particle and lithium-7 heavy ion radiation that are products of the boron + neutron nuclear reaction, and this ion radiation additionally bombards the tumor, especially from inside the tumor cells.</p>\n<p>In nuclear reactors, B is used for reactivity control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function in the form of borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.</p>\n<p>In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, B has a theoretical role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, Li and B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.</p>\n<h4>Depleted boron (boron-11)</h4>\n<p>Cosmic radiation will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures. Those neutrons will be captured in B, if it is present in the spacecraft's semiconductors, producing a gamma ray, an alpha particle, and a lithium ion. These resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor 'chip' structures, causing data loss (bit flipping, or single event upset). In radiation hardened semiconductor designs, one countermeasure is to use <b>depleted boron</b> which is greatly enriched in B and contains almost no B. B is largely immune to radiation damage. Depleted boron is a by-product of the nuclear industry.</p>\n<p>B is also a candidate as a fuel for aneutronic fusion. When struck by a proton with energy of about 500&nbsp;keV, it produces three alpha particles and 8.7&nbsp;MeV of energy. Most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation, which weakens reactor structures and induces long term radioactivity thereby endangering operating personnel. Whereas, the alpha particles from B fusion can be turned directly into electric power, and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off.</p>\n<h4>NMR spectroscopy</h4>\n<p>Both B and B possess nuclear spin. The nuclear spin of B is 3 and that of B is 3/2. These isotopes are, therefore, of use in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron-11 nuclei are available commercially. The B and B nuclei also cause splitting in the resonances of attached nuclei.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also category: Borate minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA fragment of ulexite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBorax crystals</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Boron is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust, representing only 0.001%. The worldwide commercial borate deposits are estimated at 10 million tonnes. Turkey and the United States are the world's largest producers of boron. Turkey has 63% of the world’s boron reserves. Boron does not appear on Earth in elemental form but is found combined in borax, boric acid, colemanite, kernite, ulexite and borates. Boric acid is sometimes found in volcanic spring waters.</p>\n<p>Ulexite is one of over a hundred borate minerals; it is a fibrous crystal where individual fibers can guide light like optical fibers.</p>\n<p>Economically important sources of boron are rasorite (kernite) and tincal (borax ore). They are both found in the Mojave Desert of California where the Rio Tinto Borax Mine (also known as the U.S. Borax Boron Mine) 35°2′34.447″N 117°40′45.412″W﻿ / ﻿35.04290194°N 117.67928111°W﻿ / 35.04290194; -117.67928111﻿ (Rio Tinto Borax Mine) near Boron, California is California's largest open-pit mine and the largest borax mine in the world, producing nearly half the world's borates from this single site. However, the largest borax deposits known, many still untapped, are in Central and Western Turkey including the provinces of Eskişehir, Kütahya and Balıkesir.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>The production of boron compounds does not involve formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.</p>\n<p>The earliest routes to elemental boron involved reduction of boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However the product is almost always contaminated with metal borides. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified with the zone melting or Czochralski processes.</p>\n<h3>Market trend</h3>\n<p>Estimated global consumption of boron rose to a record 1.8&nbsp;million tonnes of BO in 2005, following a period of strong growth in demand from Asia, Europe and North America. Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.</p>\n<p>The form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like colemanite has declined following concerns over arsenic content. Consumers have moved towards the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content. The average cost of crystalline boron is $5/g.</p>\n<p>Increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity. Eti Mine Company of Turkey opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at Emet in 2003. Rio Tinto Group increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate (borax) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.</p>\n<p>The rise in global demand has been driven by high growth rates in fiberglass and borosilicate production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Asia with a consequent increase in demand for borates has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Nearly all boron ore extracted from the Earth is destined for refinement into boric acid and sodium tetraborate pentahydrate. In the United States, 70% of the boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics.</p>\n<h3>Glass and ceramics</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBorosilicate glassware. Displayed are two beakers and a test tube.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Borosilicate glass, which is typically 12–15% BO, 80% SiO, and 2% AlO, has a low coefficient of thermal expansion giving it a good resistance to thermal shock. Duran and Pyrex are two major brand names for this glass, used both in laboratory glassware and in consumer cookware and bakeware, chiefly for this resistance.</p>\n<p>Boron filaments are high-strength, lightweight materials that are used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures as a component of composite materials, as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and fishing rods. The fibers can be produced by chemical vapor deposition of boron on a tungsten filament.</p>\n<p>Boron fibers and sub-millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (elastic modulus 450&nbsp;GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17&nbsp;GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems.</p>\n<h3>Detergent formulations and bleaching agents</h3>\n<p>Borax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products, including the well-known \"20 Mule Team Borax\" laundry booster and \"Boraxo\" powdered hand soap. It is also present in some tooth bleaching formulas.</p>\n<p>Sodium perborate serves as a source of active oxygen in many detergents, laundry detergents, cleaning products, and laundry bleaches. However, despite its name, \"Borateem\" laundry bleach no longer contains any boron compounds, using sodium percarbonate instead as a bleaching agent.</p>\n<h3>Insecticides</h3>\n<p>Boric acid is used as an insecticide, notably against ants, fleas, and cockroaches.</p>\n<h3>Semiconductors</h3>\n<p>Boron is a useful dopant for such semiconductors as silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (BO), liquid (BBr), or gaseous boron sources (BH or BF). However, after 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF as a boron source. Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides. Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.</p>\n<h3>Magnets</h3>\n<p>Boron is a component of neodymium magnets (NdFeB), which are the strongest type of permanent magnet. They are found in a variety of domestic and professional electromechanical and electronic devices, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), various motors and actuators, computer HDDs, CD and DVD players, mobile phones, timer switches, speakers, and so on.</p>\n<h3>High-hardness and abrasive compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: Superhard materials</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBoron carbide is used for inner plates of ballistic vests</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Several boron compounds are known for their extreme hardness and toughness.</p>\n<p>Boron carbide and cubic boron nitride powders are widely used as abrasives. Metal borides are used for coating tools through chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through ion implantation or ion beam deposition, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride.</p>\n<h4>Boron carbide</h4>\n<div>Main article: boron carbide</div>\n<p>Boron carbide is a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing BO with carbon in the electric furnace:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 BO + 7 C → BC + 6 CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Boron carbide's structure is only approximately BC, and it shows a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula BC (i.e., with B dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon as the suggested C units are replaced with B-C chains, and there are smaller (B) octahedra present as well. (See the article for structural analysis).</p>\n<p>The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.</p>\n<p>Boron carbide's ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.</p>\n\n<h4>Other superhard boron compounds</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Heterodiamond (also called BCN);</li>\n<li>Boron nitride. This material is isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN is used as a high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller, but chemical stability is superior to that of diamond.</li>\n<li>Rhenium diboride can be produced at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is comparable to that of tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.</li>\n<li>AlMgB + TiB composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Shielding in nuclear reactors</h3>\n<p>Boron shielding is used as a control for nuclear reactors, taking advantage of its high cross-section for neutron capture.</p>\n<h3>Other nonmedical uses</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-videopayload=\"&lt;div class=&quot;mediaContainer&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;width:320px&quot;&gt;&lt;video id=&quot;mwe_player_1&quot; style=&quot;width:320px;height:240px&quot; poster=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Apollo_15_launch.ogg/320px--Apollo_15_launch.ogg.jpg&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;kskin&quot; data-durationhint=&quot;73.6736&quot; data-startoffset=&quot;0&quot; data-mwtitle=&quot;Apollo_15_launch.ogg&quot; data-mwprovider=&quot;wikimediacommons&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Apollo_15_launch.ogg&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg; codecs=&amp;quot;theora, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; data-title=&quot;Original Ogg file, 320 × 240 (148 kbps)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;Ogg source&quot; data-width=&quot;320&quot; data-height=&quot;240&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;147562&quot; data-framerate=&quot;29.97002997003&quot; /&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/f/f2/Apollo_15_launch.ogg/Apollo_15_launch.ogg.360p.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm; codecs=&amp;quot;vp8, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; transcodekey=&quot;360p.webm&quot; data-title=&quot;Web streamable WebM (360P)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;WebM 360P&quot; data-width=&quot;320&quot; data-height=&quot;240&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;396208&quot; data-framerate=&quot;29.97002997003&quot; /&gt;Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.&lt;br /&gt;\nYou can &lt;a href=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Apollo_15_launch.ogg&quot;&gt;download the clip&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TimedMediaHandler/Client_download&quot;&gt;download a player&lt;/a&gt; to play the clip in your browser.&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLaunch of <i>Apollo 15</i> Saturn V rocket, using triethylborane ignitor</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Because of its distinctive green flame, amorphous boron is used in pyrotechnic flares.</li>\n<li>Starch and casein-based adhesives contain sodium tetraborate decahydrate (NaBO•10 HO)</li>\n<li>Some anti-corrosion systems contain borax.</li>\n<li>Sodium borates are used as a flux for soldering silver and gold and with ammonium chloride for welding ferrous metals.

It was also used to ignite the F-1 Engines on the Saturn V Rocket utilized by NASA's Apollo and Skylab programs from 1967 until 1973. Triethylborane is suitable for this because of its pyrophoric properties, especially the fact that it burns with a very high temperature. Triethylborane is an industrial initiator in radical reactions, where it is effective even at low temperatures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pharmaceutical and biological applications</h3>\n<p><b>Boric acid</b> has antiseptic, antifungal, and antiviral properties and for this reasons is applied as a water clarifier in swimming pool water treatment. Mild solutions of boric acid have been used as eye antiseptics.</p>\n<p><b>Bortezomib</b> (<i>Velcade</i>). Boron appears as an active element in its first-approved organic pharmaceutical in the novel pharmaceutical bortezomib, a new class of drug called the proteasome inhibitors, which are active in myeloma and one form of lymphoma (it is in currently in experimental trials against other types of lymphoma). The boron atom in bortezomib binds the catalytic site of the 26S proteasome with high affinity and specificity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A number of potential boronated pharmaceuticals using boron-10, have been prepared for use in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).</li>\n<li>Some boron compounds show promise in treating arthritis, though none have as yet been generally approved for the purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Research areas</h3>\n<p>Magnesium diboride is an important superconducting material with the transition temperature of 39&nbsp;K. MgB wires are produced with the powder-in-tube process and applied in superconducting magnets.</p>\n<p>Amorphous boron is used as a melting point depressant in nickel-chromium braze alloys.</p>\n<p>Hexagonal boron nitride forms atomically thin layers, which have been used to enhance the electron mobility in graphene devices. It also forms nanotubular structures (BNNTs), which have with high strength, high chemical stability, and high thermal conductivity, among its list of desirable properties.</p>\n<h2>Natural biological role</h2>\n<p>There is a boron-containing natural antibiotic, boromycin, isolated from streptomyces. Boron is an essential plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. Conversely, high soil concentrations of &gt; 1.0&nbsp;ppm can cause marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8&nbsp;ppm can cause these same symptoms to appear in plants particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of boron in the soil, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when boron content in the soil is greater than 1.8&nbsp;ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0&nbsp;ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive. When boron levels in plant tissue exceed 200&nbsp;ppm symptoms of boron toxicity are likely to appear.</p>\n<p>As an ultratrace element, boron is necessary for the optimal health of rats, although it is necessary in such small amounts that ultrapurified foods and dust filtration of air is necessary to induce boron deficiency, which manifest as poor coat or hair quality. Presumably, boron is necessary to other mammals. No deficiency syndrome in humans has been described. Small amounts of boron occur widely in the diet, and the amounts needed in the diet would, by analogy with rodent studies, be very small. The exact physiological role of boron in the animal kingdom is poorly understood.</p>\n<p>Boron occurs in all foods produced from plants. Since 1989 its nutritional value has been argued. It is thought that boron plays several biochemical roles in animals, including humans. The U.S. Department of agriculture conducted an experiment in which postmenopausal women took 3&nbsp;mg of boron a day. The results showed that supplemental boron reduced excretion of calcium by 44%, and activated estrogen and vitamin D, suggesting a possible role in the suppression of osteoporosis. However, whether these effects were conventionally nutritional, or medicinal, could not be determined. The U.S. National Institutes of Health states that \"Total daily boron intake in normal human diets ranges from 2.1–4.3&nbsp;mg boron/day.\"</p>\n<p>Congenital endothelial dystrophy type 2, a rare form of corneal dystrophy, is linked to mutations in SLC4A11 gene that encodes a transporter reportedly regulating the intracellular concentration of boron.</p>\n<h3>Analytical quantification</h3>\n<p>For determination of boron content in food or materials the colorimetric curcumin method is used. Boron has to be transferred to boric acid or borates and on reaction with curcumin in acidic solution, a red colored boron-chelate complex, rosocyanine, is formed.</p>\n<h3>Health issues and toxicity</h3>\n<p>Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, and many organoboron compounds are non-toxic to humans and animals (approximately similar to table salt). The LD (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6&nbsp;g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD above 2&nbsp;g are considered non-toxic. The minimum lethal dose for humans has not been established. An intake of 4&nbsp;g/day of boric acid was reported without incidents, but more than this is considered toxic for more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5&nbsp;grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity. Single medical doses of 20&nbsp;g of boric acid for neutron capture therapy have been used without undue toxicity. Fish have survived for 30&nbsp;min in a saturated boric acid solution and can survive longer in strong borax solutions. Boric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals, and is routinely used as an insecticide.</p>\n<p>The boranes (boron hydrogen compounds) and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, it is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but toxicity depends on structure.</p>\n<p>The boranes are toxic as well as highly flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard due to its reducing nature, and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.</p>"

  "title": "Carbon",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Carbon (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Carbon</b> (from Latin: carbo \"coal\") is the chemical element with symbol <b>C</b> and atomic number 6. As a member of group 14 on the periodic table, it is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. There are three naturally occurring isotopes, with C and C being stable, while C is radioactive, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730&nbsp;years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.</p>\n<p>There are several allotropes of carbon of which the best known are graphite, diamond, and amorphous carbon. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, diamond is highly transparent, while graphite is opaque and black. Diamond is the hardest naturally-occurring material known, while graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek word \"γράφω\" which means \"to write\"). Diamond has a very low electrical conductivity, while graphite is a very good conductor. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotube and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials.</p>\n<p>All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen. The most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and other transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil and methane clathrates. Carbon forms more compounds than any other element, with almost ten million pure organic compounds described to date, which in turn are a tiny fraction of such compounds that are theoretically possible under standard conditions.</p>\n<p>Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. It is present in all known life forms, and in the human body carbon is the second most abundant element by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen. This abundance, together with the unique diversity of organic compounds and their unusual polymer-forming ability at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, make this element the chemical basis of all known life.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTheoretically predicted phase diagram of carbon</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The different forms or <i>allotropes</i> of carbon (see below) include the hardest naturally occurring substance, diamond, and also one of the softest known substances, graphite. Moreover, it has an affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with such atoms. As a result, carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds; the large majority of all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2&nbsp;MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330 °C or 7,820 °F), so it sublimes at about 3,900&nbsp;K.</p>\n<p>Carbon sublimes in a carbon arc which has a temperature of about 5,800 K (5,530 °C; 9,980 °F). Thus, irrespective of its allotropic form, carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest melting point metals such as tungsten or rhenium. Although thermodynamically prone to oxidation, carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as iron and copper that are weaker reducing agents at room temperature.</p>\n<p>Carbon compounds form the basis of all known life on Earth, and the carbon-nitrogen cycle provides some of the energy produced by the Sun and other stars. Although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds, most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions. At standard temperature and pressure, it resists all but the strongest oxidizers. It does not react with sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, chlorine or any alkalis. At elevated temperatures carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon oxides, and will reduce such metal oxides as iron oxide to the metal. This exothermic reaction is used in the iron and steel industry to control the carbon content of steel:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Fe\n3O\n4 + 4 C → 3 Fe + 4 CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>with sulfur to form carbon disulfide and with steam in the coal-gas reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>C + HO → CO + H.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Carbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides, such as the iron carbide cementite in steel, and tungsten carbide, widely used as an abrasive and for making hard tips for cutting tools.</p>\n<p>As of 2009, graphene appears to be the strongest material ever tested. However, the process of separating it from graphite will require some technological development before it is economical enough to be used in industrial processes.</p>\n<p>The system of carbon allotropes spans a range of extremes:</p>\n\n<h3>Allotropes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Allotropes of carbon</div>\n<p>Atomic carbon is a very short-lived species and, therefore, carbon is stabilized in various multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called allotropes. The three relatively well-known allotropes of carbon are amorphous carbon, graphite, and diamond. Once considered exotic, fullerenes are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research; they include buckyballs, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanobuds and nanofibers. Several other exotic allotropes have also been discovered, such as lonsdaleite, glassy carbon, carbon nanofoam and linear acetylenic carbon (carbyne).</p>\n<p>The amorphous form is an assortment of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, which is essentially graphite but not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures carbon takes the form of graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSome allotropes of carbon: a) diamond; b) graphite; c) lonsdaleite; d–f) fullerenes (C, C, C); g) amorphous carbon; h) carbon nanotube.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>At very high pressures carbon forms the more compact allotrope diamond, having nearly twice the density of graphite. Here, each atom is bonded tetrahedrally to four others, thus making a 3-dimensional network of puckered six-membered rings of atoms. Diamond has the same cubic structure as silicon and germanium and because of the strength of the carbon-carbon bonds, it is the hardest naturally occurring substance in terms of resistance to scratching. Contrary to the popular belief that <i>\"diamonds are forever\"</i>, they are in fact thermodynamically unstable under normal conditions and transform into graphite. However, due to a high activation energy barrier, the transition into graphite is so extremely slow at room temperature as to be unnoticeable. Under some conditions, carbon crystallizes as lonsdaleite. This form has a hexagonal crystal lattice where all atoms are covalently bonded. Therefore, all properties of lonsdaleite are close to those of diamond.</p>\n<p>Fullerenes have a graphite-like structure, but instead of purely hexagonal packing, they also contain pentagons (or even heptagons) of carbon atoms, which bend the sheet into spheres, ellipses or cylinders. The properties of fullerenes (split into buckyballs, buckytubes and nanobuds) have not yet been fully analyzed and represent an intense area of research in nanomaterials. The names <i>\"fullerene\"</i> and <i>\"buckyball\"</i> are given after Richard Buckminster Fuller, popularizer of geodesic domes, which resemble the structure of fullerenes. The buckyballs are fairly large molecules formed completely of carbon bonded trigonally, forming spheroids (the best-known and simplest is the soccerball-shaped C buckminsterfullerene). Carbon nanotubes are structurally similar to buckyballs, except that each atom is bonded trigonally in a curved sheet that forms a hollow cylinder. Nanobuds were first reported in 2007 and are hybrid bucky tube/buckyball materials (buckyballs are covalently bonded to the outer wall of a nanotube) that combine the properties of both in a single structure.</p>\n<p>Of the other discovered allotropes, carbon nanofoam is a ferromagnetic allotrope discovered in 1997. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web, in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six- and seven-membered rings. It is among the lightest known solids, with a density of about 2&nbsp;kg/m. Similarly, glassy carbon contains a high proportion of closed porosity, but contrary to normal graphite, the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book, but have a more random arrangement. Linear acetylenic carbon has the chemical structure -(C:::C)-. Carbon in this modification is linear with <i>sp</i> orbital hybridization, and is a polymer with alternating single and triple bonds. This type of carbyne is of considerable interest to nanotechnology as its Young's modulus is forty times that of the hardest known material&nbsp;– diamond.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGraphite ore</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRaw diamond crystal.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n\"Present day\" (1990s) sea surface dissolved inorganic carbon concentration (from the GLODAP climatology)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Carbon is the fourth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.</p>\n<p>In combination with oxygen in carbon dioxide, carbon is found in the Earth's atmosphere (approximately 810&nbsp;gigatonnes of carbon) and dissolved in all water bodies (approximately 36,000&nbsp;gigatonnes of carbon). Around 1,900&nbsp;gigatonnes of carbon are present in the biosphere. Hydrocarbons (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas) contain carbon as well—coal \"reserves\" (not \"resources\") amount to around 900&nbsp;gigatonnes, and oil reserves around 150&nbsp;gigatonnes. Proven sources of natural gas are about 175&nbsp;10 cubic metres (representing about 105 gigatonnes carbon), but it is estimated that there are also about 900&nbsp;10 cubic metres of \"unconventional\" gas such as shale gas, representing about 540 gigatonnes of carbon. Carbon is also locked up as methane hydrates in polar regions and under the seas. Various estimates of the amount of carbon this represents have been made: 500 to 2500 Gt, or 3000 Gt. (In the past, quantities of hydrocarbons were greater. In the period from 1751 to 2008 about 347 gigatonnes of carbon were released as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels.)</p>\n<p>Carbon is a major component in very large masses of carbonate rock (limestone, dolomite, marble and so on). Coal is the largest commercial source of mineral carbon, accounting for 4,000&nbsp;gigatonnes or 80% of fossil carbon fuel. It is also rich in carbon – for example, anthracite contains 92–98%.</p>\n<p>As for individual carbon allotropes, graphite is found in large quantities in the United States (mostly in New York and Texas), Russia, Mexico, Greenland, and India. Natural diamonds occur in the rock kimberlite, found in ancient volcanic \"necks\", or \"pipes\". Most diamond deposits are in Africa, notably in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, the Republic of the Congo, and Sierra Leone. There are also deposits in Arkansas, Canada, the Russian Arctic, Brazil and in Northern and Western Australia. Diamonds are now also being recovered from the ocean floor off the Cape of Good Hope. However, though diamonds are found naturally, about 30% of all industrial diamonds used in the U.S. are now made synthetically.</p>\n<p>Carbon-14 is formed in upper layers of the troposphere and the stratosphere, at altitudes of 9–15&nbsp;km, by a reaction that is precipitated by cosmic rays. Thermal neutrons are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen-14, forming carbon-14 and a proton.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of carbon</div>\n<p>Isotopes of carbon are atomic nuclei that contain six protons plus a number of neutrons (varying from 2 to 16). Carbon has two stable, naturally occurring isotopes. The isotope carbon-12 (C) forms 98.93% of the carbon on Earth, while carbon-13 (C) forms the remaining 1.07%. The concentration of C is further increased in biological materials because biochemical reactions discriminate against C. In 1961, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted the isotope carbon-12 as the basis for atomic weights. Identification of carbon in NMR experiments is done with the isotope C.</p>\n<p>Carbon-14 (C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope which occurs in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158 MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730&nbsp;years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks, but is created in the upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. The abundance of C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000&nbsp;years.</p>\n<p>There are 15 known isotopes of carbon and the shortest-lived of these is C which decays through proton emission and alpha decay and has a half-life of 1.98739x10 s. The exotic C exhibits a nuclear halo, which means its radius is appreciably larger than would be expected if the nucleus were a sphere of constant density.</p>\n<h3>Formation in stars</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Triple-alpha process and CNO cycle</div>\n<p>Formation of the carbon atomic nucleus requires a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles (helium nuclei) within the core of a giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei. This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang. Instead, the interiors of stars in the horizontal branch transform three helium nuclei into carbon by means of this triple-alpha process. In order to be available for formation of life as we know it, this carbon must then later be scattered into space as dust, in supernova explosions, as part of the material which later forms second, third-generation star systems which have planets accreted from such dust. The Solar System is one such third-generation star system. Another of the fusion mechanisms powering stars is the CNO cycle, in which carbon acts as a catalyst to allow the reaction to proceed.</p>\n<p>Rotational transitions of various isotopic forms of carbon monoxide (for example, CO, CO, and CO) are detectable in the submillimeter wavelength range, and are used in the study of newly forming stars in molecular clouds.</p>\n<h3>Carbon cycle</h3>\n<div>Main article: Carbon cycle</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDiagram of the carbon cycle. The black numbers indicate how much carbon is stored in various reservoirs, in billions tonnes (\"GtC\" stands for gigatonnes of carbon; figures are circa 2004). The purple numbers indicate how much carbon moves between reservoirs each year. The sediments, as defined in this diagram, do not include the ~70&nbsp;million GtC of carbonate rock and kerogen.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Under terrestrial conditions, conversion of one element to another is very rare. Therefore, the amount of carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths that carbon follows in the environment make up the carbon cycle. For example, plants draw carbon dioxide out of their environment and use it to build biomass, as in carbon respiration or the Calvin cycle, a process of carbon fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, whereas some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which can burn with the release of carbon, should bacteria not consume it.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>Main article: Compounds of carbon</div>\n<h3>Organic compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructural formula of methane, the simplest possible organic compound.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCorrelation between the <i>carbon cycle</i> and formation of organic compounds. In plants, carbon dioxide formed by carbon fixation can join with water in photosynthesis (green) to form organic compounds, which can be used and further converted by both plants and animals.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Carbon has the ability to form very long chains of interconnecting C-C bonds. This property is called catenation. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong, and stable. This property allows carbon to form an almost infinite number of compounds; in fact, there are more known carbon-containing compounds than all the compounds of the other chemical elements combined except those of hydrogen (because almost all organic compounds contain hydrogen too).</p>\n<p>The simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbon—a large family of organic molecules that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. Chain length, side chains and functional groups all affect the properties of organic molecules.</p>\n<p>Carbon occurs in all known organic life and is the basis of organic chemistry. When united with hydrogen, it forms various hydrocarbons which are important to industry as refrigerants, lubricants, solvents, as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of plastics and petrochemicals and as fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars, lignans, chitins, alcohols, fats, and aromatic esters, carotenoids and terpenes. With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics, amino acids, and rubber products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical-code carriers of life, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.</p>\n<h3>Inorganic compounds</h3>\n<p>Commonly carbon-containing compounds which are associated with minerals or which do not contain hydrogen or fluorine, are treated separately from classical organic compounds; however the definition is not rigid (see reference articles above). Among these are the simple oxides of carbon. The most prominent oxide is carbon dioxide (CO). This was once the principal constituent of the paleoatmosphere, but is a minor component of the Earth's atmosphere today. Dissolved in water, it forms carbonic acid (H\n2CO\n3), but as most compounds with multiple single-bonded oxygens on a single carbon it is unstable. Through this intermediate, though, resonance-stabilized carbonate ions are produced. Some important minerals are carbonates, notably calcite. Carbon disulfide (CS\n2) is similar.</p>\n<p>The other common oxide is carbon monoxide (CO). It is formed by incomplete combustion, and is a colorless, odorless gas. The molecules each contain a triple bond and are fairly polar, resulting in a tendency to bind permanently to hemoglobin molecules, displacing oxygen, which has a lower binding affinity. Cyanide (CN), has a similar structure, but behaves much like a halide ion (pseudohalogen). For example it can form the nitride cyanogen molecule ((CN)), similar to diatomic halides. Other uncommon oxides are carbon suboxide (C\n3O\n2), the unstable dicarbon monoxide (CO), carbon trioxide (CO), cyclopentanepentone (CO) cyclohexanehexone (CO), and mellitic anhydride (CO).</p>\n<p>With reactive metals, such as tungsten, carbon forms either carbides (C), or acetylides (C2−\n2) to form alloys with high melting points. These anions are also associated with methane and acetylene, both very weak acids. With an electronegativity of 2.5, carbon prefers to form covalent bonds. A few carbides are covalent lattices, like carborundum (SiC), which resembles diamond.</p>\n<h3>Organometallic compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organometallic chemistry</div>\n<p>Organometallic compounds by definition contain at least one carbon-metal bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, tetraethyllead), η-alkene compounds (for example, Zeise's salt), and η-allyl compounds (for example, allylpalladium chloride dimer); metallocenes containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, ferrocene); and transition metal carbene complexes. Many metal carbonyls exist (for example, tetracarbonylnickel); some workers consider the carbon monoxide ligand to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.</p>\n<p>While carbon is understood to exclusively form four bonds, an interesting compound containing an octahedral hexacoordinated carbon atom has been reported. The cation of the compound is [(PhPAu)C]. This phenomenon has been attributed to the aurophilicity of the gold ligands.</p>\n<h2>History and etymology</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAntoine Lavoisier in his youth</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The English name <i>carbon</i> comes from the Latin <i>carbo</i> for coal and charcoal, whence also comes the French <i>charbon</i>, meaning charcoal. In German, Dutch and Danish, the names for carbon are <i>Kohlenstoff</i>, <i>koolstof</i> and <i>kulstof</i> respectively, all literally meaning coal-substance.</p>\n<p>Carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of soot and charcoal to the earliest human civilizations. Diamonds were known probably as early as 2500&nbsp;BCE in China, while carbon in the form of charcoal was made around Roman times by the same chemistry as it is today, by heating wood in a pyramid covered with clay to exclude air.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCarl Wilhelm Scheele</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 1722, René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur demonstrated that iron was transformed into steel through the absorption of some substance, now known to be carbon. In 1772, Antoine Lavoisier showed that diamonds are a form of carbon; when he burned samples of charcoal and diamond and found that neither produced any water and that both released the same amount of carbon dioxide per gram. In 1779, Carl Wilhelm Scheele showed that graphite, which had been thought of as a form of lead, was instead identical with charcoal but with a small admixture of iron, and that it gave \"aerial acid\" (his name for carbon dioxide) when oxidized with nitric acid. In 1786, the French scientists Claude Louis Berthollet, Gaspard Monge and C. A. Vandermonde confirmed that graphite was mostly carbon by oxidizing it in oxygen in much the same way Lavoisier had done with diamond. Some iron again was left, which the French scientists thought was necessary to the graphite structure. However, in their publication they proposed the name <i>carbone</i> (Latin <i>carbonum</i>) for the element in graphite which was given off as a gas upon burning graphite. Antoine Lavoisier then listed carbon as an element in his 1789 textbook.</p>\n<p>A new allotrope of carbon, fullerene, that was discovered in 1985 includes nanostructured forms such as buckyballs and nanotubes. Their discoverers – Robert Curl, Harold Kroto and Richard Smalley – received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996. The resulting renewed interest in new forms lead to the discovery of further exotic allotropes, including glassy carbon, and the realization that \"amorphous carbon\" is not strictly amorphous.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<h3>Graphite</h3>\n<div>Main article: Graphite</div>\n<p>Commercially viable natural deposits of graphite occur in many parts of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a meter or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.</p>\n<p>There are three types of natural graphite—amorphous, flake or crystalline flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant. Contrary to science, in industry \"amorphous\" refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United States. Flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock. Flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses, such as flame retardants. The foremost deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar. Vein or lump graphite is the rarest, most valuable, and highest quality type of natural graphite. It occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps, and it is only commercially mined in Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p>According to the USGS, world production of natural graphite was 1.1&nbsp;million tonnes in 2010, to which China contributed 800,000&nbsp;t, India 130,000 t, Brazil 76,000&nbsp;t, North Korea 30,000&nbsp;t and Canada 25,000 t. No natural graphite was reported mined in the United States, but 118,000 t of synthetic graphite with an estimated value of $998&nbsp;million was produced in 2009.<br></p>\n<h3>Diamond</h3>\n<div>Main article: Diamond</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDiamond output in 2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world (see figure).</p>\n<p>Only a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.</p>\n<p>Historically diamonds were known to be found only in alluvial deposits in southern India. India led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the 9th century BCE to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725.</p>\n<p>Diamond production of primary deposits (kimberlites and lamproites) only started in the 1870s after the discovery of the Diamond fields in South Africa. Production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4.5&nbsp;billion carats have been mined since that date. About 20% of that amount has been mined in the last 5 years alone, and during the last ten years 9 new mines have started production while 4 more are waiting to be opened soon. Most of these mines are located in Canada, Zimbabwe, Angola, and one in Russia.</p>\n<p>In the United States, diamonds have been found in Arkansas, Colorado and Montana. In 2004, a startling discovery of a microscopic diamond in the United States led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite pipes in a remote part of Montana.</p>\n<p>Today, most commercially viable diamond deposits are in Russia, Botswana, Australia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2005, Russia produced almost one-fifth of the global diamond output, reports the British Geological Survey. Australia has the richest diamantiferous pipe with production reaching peak levels of 42 metric tons (41&nbsp;long tons; 46&nbsp;short tons) per year in the 1990s. There are also commercial deposits being actively mined in the Northwest Territories of Canada, Siberia (mostly in Yakutia territory; for example, Mir pipe and Udachnaya pipe), Brazil, and in Northern and Western Australia.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPencil leads for mechanical pencils are made of graphite (often mixed with a clay or synthetic binder).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSticks of vine and compressed charcoal.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA cloth of woven carbon filaments</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSilicon carbide single crystal</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe <i>C</i> fullerene in crystalline form</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTungsten carbide milling bits</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Carbon is essential to all known living systems, and without it life as we know it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is used by the petrochemical industry to produce, amongst other things, gasoline and kerosene, through a distillation process, in refineries. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is mainly used for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.</p>\n<p>The uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied. It can form alloys with iron, of which the most common is carbon steel. Graphite is combined with clays to form the 'lead' used in pencils used for writing and drawing. It is also used as a lubricant and a pigment, as a molding material in glass manufacture, in electrodes for dry batteries and in electroplating and electroforming, in brushes for electric motors and as a neutron moderator in nuclear reactors.</p>\n<p>Charcoal is used as a drawing material in artwork, for grilling, and in many other uses including iron smelting. Wood, coal and oil are used as fuel for production of energy and space heating. Gem quality diamond is used in jewelry, and industrial diamonds are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and carbon fiber, made by pyrolysis of synthetic polyester fibers is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight composite materials. Carbon fiber is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel.</p>\n<p>Carbon black is used as the black pigment in printing ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal is used as an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification and kitchen extractor hoods and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron. Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.</p>\n<h3>Diamonds</h3>\n<p>The diamond industry can be broadly separated into two basically distinct categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and another for industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in both types of diamonds exists, the two markets act in dramatically different ways.</p>\n<p>A large trade in gem-grade diamonds exists. Unlike precious metals such as gold or platinum, gem diamonds do not trade as a commodity: there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.</p>\n<p>The market for industrial-grade diamonds operates much differently from its gem-grade counterpart. Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, making many of the gemological characteristics of diamond, including clarity and color, mostly irrelevant. This helps explain why 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20&nbsp;tonnes annually), unsuitable for use as gemstones and known as <i>bort</i>, are destined for industrial use. In addition to mined diamonds, synthetic diamonds found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 3&nbsp;billion carats (600&nbsp;tonnes) of synthetic diamond is produced annually for industrial use. The dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most uses of diamonds in these technologies do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds that are gem-quality except for their small size, can find an industrial use. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamonds, future applications are beginning to become feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable to build microchips from, or the use of diamond as a heat sink in electronics.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorker at carbon black plant in Sunray, Texas (photo by John Vachon, 1942)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Pure carbon has extremely low toxicity to humans and can be handled and even ingested safely in the form of graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract, for example. Consequently once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black was probably one of the first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200&nbsp;years after his death. However, inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Similarly, diamond dust used as an abrasive can do harm if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harmful effects may result from contamination of the carbon particles, with organic chemicals or heavy metals for example, rather than from the carbon itself.</p>\n<p>Carbon generally has low toxicity to almost all life on Earth; however, to some creatures it can still be toxic. For instance, carbon nanoparticles are deadly to <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>\n<p>Carbon may also burn vigorously and brightly in the presence of air at high temperatures, as in the Windscale fire, which was caused by sudden release of stored Wigner energy in the graphite core. Large accumulations of coal, which have remained inert for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of oxygen, may spontaneously combust when exposed to air, for example in coal mine waste tips.</p>\n<p>The great variety of carbon compounds include such lethal poisons as tetrodotoxin, the lectin ricin from seeds of the castor oil plant <i>Ricinus communis</i>, cyanide (CN) and carbon monoxide; and such essentials to life as glucose and protein.</p>\n<h2>Bonding to carbon</h2>"

  "title": "Nitrogen",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Nitrogen</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>N</b> and atomic number&nbsp;7. Elemental nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and mostly inert diatomic gas at standard conditions, constituting 78.09% by volume of Earth's atmosphere. The element nitrogen was discovered as a separable component of air, by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford, in 1772. It belongs to the pnictogen family.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen is a common element in the universe, estimated at about seventh in total abundance in our galaxy and the Solar System. It is synthesised by fusion of carbon and hydrogen in supernovae. Due to the volatility of elemental nitrogen and its common compounds with hydrogen and oxygen, nitrogen is far less common on the rocky planets of the inner Solar System, and it is a relatively rare element on Earth as a whole. However, as on Earth, nitrogen and its compounds occur commonly as gases in the atmospheres of planets and moons that have atmospheres.</p>\n<p>Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong bond in elemental nitrogen dominates nitrogen chemistry, causing difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting the N\n2 into useful compounds, but at the same time causing release of large amounts of often useful energy when the compounds burn, explode, or decay back into nitrogen gas. Synthetically-produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilizers and fertilizer nitrates are key pollutants in causing the eutrophication of water systems.</p>\n<p>Outside their major uses as fertilizers and energy-stores, nitrogen compounds are versatile organics. Nitrogen is part of materials as diverse as Kevlar fabric and cyanoacrylate \"super\" glue. Nitrogen is a constituent of molecules in every major pharmacological drug class, including the antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by being metabolized to natural nitric oxide. Plant alkaloids (often defense chemicals) contain nitrogen by definition, and thus many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as caffeine and morphine are either alkaloids or synthetic mimics that act (as many plant alkaloids do) upon receptors of animal neurotransmitters (for example, synthetic amphetamines).</p>\n<p>Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins) and also in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). The human body contains about 3% by weight of nitrogen, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere.</p>\n\n<h2>History and etymology</h2>\n<p>Nitrogen is formally considered to have been discovered by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772, who called it <i>noxious air</i> or <i>fixed air</i>. The fact that there was a component of air that does not support combustion was clear to Rutherford. Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Joseph Priestley, who referred to it as <i>burnt air</i> or <i>phlogisticated air</i>. Nitrogen gas was inert enough that Antoine Lavoisier referred to it as \"mephitic air\" or <i>azote</i>, from the Greek word ἄζωτος (<i>azotos</i>) meaning \"lifeless\". In it, animals died and flames were extinguished. Lavoisier's name for nitrogen is used in many languages (French, Italian, Polish, Russian, Albanian, etc.) and still remains in English in the common names of many compounds, such as hydrazine and compounds of the azide ion.</p>\n<p>The English word nitrogen (1794) entered the language from the French <i>nitrogène</i>, coined in 1790 by French chemist Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1756–1832), from the Greek \"nitron\" (sodium carbonate) and the French <i>gène</i> (producing). The gas had been found in nitric acid. Chaptal's meaning was that nitrogen gas is the essential part of nitric acid, in turn formed from saltpetre (potassium nitrate), then known as nitre. This word in the more ancient world originally described sodium salts that did not contain nitrate, and is a cognate of natron.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen compounds were well known by the Middle Ages. Alchemists knew nitric acid as <i>aqua fortis</i> (strong water). The mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as <i>aqua regia</i> (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold (the <i>king</i> of metals). The earliest military, industrial, and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpetre (sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate), most notably in gunpowder, and later as fertilizer. In 1910, Lord Rayleigh discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced \"active nitrogen\", an allotrope considered to be monatomic. The \"whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light\" produced by his apparatus reacted with quicksilver to produce explosive mercury nitride.</p>\n<p>For a long time the sources of nitrogen compounds was limited. The natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. The need of nitrogen compounds to produce fertilizers increased and the natural sources were limited. The nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Ostwald process and the Frank-Caro process eased that shortage of nitrogen compounds. With the discovery and scale up to industrial production of the Haber process in the 1910s changed the availability of nitrogen compounds considerably and had a large impact on the food production making it possible to feed the growing world population.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Nitrogen gas is an industrial gas produced by the fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (i.e., pressurized reverse osmosis membrane or Pressure swing adsorption). Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen).</p>\n<p>In a chemical laboratory it is prepared by treating an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride with sodium nitrite.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>NHCl(aq) + NaNO(aq) → N(g) + NaCl(aq) + 2 HO (l)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Small amounts of impurities NO and HNO are also formed in this reaction. The impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate. Very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium azide or sodium azide.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 NaN → 2 Na + 3 N</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<p>Nitrogen is a nonmetal, with an electronegativity of 3.04. It has five electrons in its outer shell and is, therefore, trivalent in most compounds. The triple bond in molecular nitrogen (N\n2) is one of the strongest. The resulting difficulty of converting N\n2 into other compounds, and the ease (and associated high energy release) of converting nitrogen compounds into elemental N\n2, have dominated the role of nitrogen in both nature and human economic activities.</p>\n<p>At atmospheric pressure, molecular nitrogen condenses (liquefies) at 77&nbsp;K (−195.79&nbsp;°C) and freezes at 63&nbsp;K (−210.01&nbsp;°C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4&nbsp;K (−237.6&nbsp;°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808 g/mL), is a common cryogen.</p>\n<p>Unstable allotropes of nitrogen consisting of more than two nitrogen atoms have been produced in the laboratory, like N\n3 and N\n4. Under extremely high pressures (1.1&nbsp;million&nbsp;atm) and high temperatures (2000&nbsp;K), as produced using a diamond anvil cell, nitrogen polymerizes into the single-bonded cubic gauche crystal structure. This structure is similar to that of diamond, and both have extremely strong covalent bonds. N\n4 is nicknamed \"nitrogen diamond\".</p>\n<p>Other (as yet unsynthesized) allotropes include hexazine (N\n6, a benzene analog) and octaazacubane (N\n8, a cubane analog). The former is predicted to be highly unstable, while the latter is predicted to be kinetically stable, for reasons of orbital symmetry.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>See also: Isotopes of nitrogen</div>\n<p>There are two stable isotopes of nitrogen: N and N. By far the most common is N (99.634%), which is produced in the CNO cycle in stars. Of the ten isotopes produced synthetically, N has a half-life of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half-lives on the order of seconds or less.</p>\n<p>Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification) strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil. These reactions typically result in N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product.</p>\n<p>A small part (0.73%) of the molecular nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere is the isotopologue NN, and almost all the rest is N.</p>\n<p>The radioisotope N is the dominant radionuclide in the coolant of pressurized water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation. It is produced from O (in water) via (n,p) reaction. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7 MeV).</p>\n<p>Because of this, the access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurized water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation. N is one of the main means used to immediately detect even small leaks from the primary coolant to the secondary steam cycle.</p>\n<p>In similar fashion, access to any of the steam cycle components in a boiling water reactor nuclear power plant must be restricted during operation. Condensate from the condenser is typically retained for 10 minutes to allow for decay of the N. This eliminates the need to shield and restrict access to any of the feed water piping or pumps.</p>\n<h3>Electromagnetic spectrum</h3>\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNitrogen discharge (spectrum) tube</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Molecular nitrogen (N) is largely transparent to infrared and visible radiation because it is a homonuclear molecule and, thus, has no dipole moment to couple to electromagnetic radiation at these wavelengths. Significant absorption occurs at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths, beginning around 100 nanometers. This is associated with electronic transitions in the molecule to states in which charge is not distributed evenly between nitrogen atoms. Nitrogen absorption leads to significant absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the Earth's upper atmosphere and the atmospheres of other planetary bodies. For similar reasons, pure molecular nitrogen lasers typically emit light in the ultraviolet range.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen also makes a contribution to visible air glow from the Earth's upper atmosphere, through electron impact excitation followed by emission. This visible blue air glow (seen in the polar aurora and in the re-entry glow of returning spacecraft) typically results not from molecular nitrogen but rather from free nitrogen atoms combining with oxygen to form nitric oxide (NO).</p>\n<p>Nitrogen gas also exhibits scintillation.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of dinitrogen, N</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of [Ru(NH)(N)]</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In general, nitrogen is unreactive at standard temperature and pressure. N reacts spontaneously with few reagents, being resilient to acids and bases as well as oxidants and most reductants. When nitrogen reacts spontaneously with a reagent, the net transformation is often called nitrogen fixation.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen reacts with elemental lithium. Lithium burns in an atmosphere of N to give lithium nitride:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>6 Li + N → 2 LiN</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Magnesium also burns in nitrogen, forming magnesium nitride.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 Mg + N → MgN</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>N forms a variety of adducts with transition metals. The first example of a dinitrogen complex is [Ru(NH)(N)] (see figure at right). However, it is interesting to note that the N2 ligand was obtained by the decomposition of hydrazine, and not coordination of free dinitrogen. Such compounds are now numerous, other examples include IrCl(N)(PPh), W(N)(PhPCHCHPPh), and [(η-CMeH)Zr](μ, η,η-N). These complexes illustrate how N might bind to the metal(s) in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the Haber process. A catalytic process to reduce N to ammonia with the use of a molybdenum complex in the presence of a proton source was published in 2005.</p>\n<p>The starting point for industrial production of nitrogen compounds is the Haber process, in which nitrogen is fixed by reacting N\n2 and H\n2 over an iron(II, III) oxide (Fe\n3O\n4) catalyst at about 500&nbsp;°C and 200 atmospheres pressure. Biological nitrogen fixation in free-living cyanobacteria and in the root nodules of plants also produces ammonia from molecular nitrogen. The reaction, which is the source of the bulk of nitrogen in the biosphere, is catalyzed by the nitrogenase enzyme complex that contains Fe and Mo atoms, using energy derived from hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate (−20.5 kJ/mol).</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>See also category: Nitrate minerals</div>\n<div>See also category: Ammonium minerals</div>\n<p>Nitrogen is the largest constituent of the Earth's atmosphere (78.082% by volume of dry air, 75.3% by weight in dry air). However, this high concentration does not reflect nitrogen's overall low abundance in the makeup of the Earth, from which most of the element escaped by solar evaporation, early in the planet's formation.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen is a common element in the universe, and is estimated to be approximately the seventh most abundant chemical element by mass in the universe, our galaxy and the Solar System. Its occurrence there is thought to be entirely due to synthesis by fusion from carbon and hydrogen in supernovas. In these places it was originally created by fusion processes from carbon and hydrogen in supernovas. Molecular nitrogen and nitrogen compounds have been detected in interstellar space by astronomers using the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer.</p>\n<p>Due to the volatility of elemental nitrogen and also its common compounds with hydrogen and oxygen, nitrogen and its compounds were driven out of the planetesimals in the early Solar System by the heat of the Sun, and in the form of gases, were lost to the rocky planets of the inner Solar System. Nitrogen is therefore a relatively rare element on these inner planets, including Earth, as a whole. In this, nitrogen resembles neon, which has a similar abundance in the universe, but is also rare in the inner Solar System. Nitrogen is estimated at 30 of the elements in crustal abundance. There exist some relatively uncommon nitrogen minerals, such as saltpetre (potassium nitrate), Chile saltpetre (sodium nitrate) and sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride). Even these are known mainly as concentrated from evaporative ocean beds, due to their ready solubility of most naturally-occurring nitrogen compounds in water. A similar pattern occurs with the water solubility of the uncommon light element boron.</p>\n<p>However, nitrogen and its compounds occur far more commonly as gases in the atmospheres of planets and moons that are large enough to have atmospheres. For example, molecular nitrogen is a major constituent of not only Earth's atmosphere, but also the Saturnian moon Titan's thick atmosphere. Also, due to retention by gravity at colder temperatures, nitrogen and its compounds occur in trace to appreciable amounts in planetary atmospheres of the gas giant planets.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen is present in all living organisms, in proteins, nucleic acids, and other molecules. It typically makes up around 4% of the dry weight of plant matter, and around 3% of the weight of the human body. It is a large component of animal waste (for example, guano), usually in the form of urea, uric acid, ammonium compounds, and derivatives of these nitrogenous products, which are essential nutrients for all plants that cannot fix atmospheric nitrogen.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Nitrogen compounds</div>\n<p>The main neutral hydride of nitrogen is ammonia (NH\n3), although hydrazine (N\n2H\n4) is also commonly used. Ammonia is more basic than water by 6 orders of magnitude. In solution ammonia forms the ammonium ion (NH+\n4). Liquid ammonia (boiling point 240&nbsp;K) is amphiprotic (displaying either Brønsted-Lowry acidic or basic character) and forms ammonium and the less common amide ions (NH−\n2); both amides and nitride (N3−) salts are known, but decompose in water. Singly, doubly, triply and quadruply substituted alkyl compounds of ammonia are called amines (four substitutions, to form commercially and biologically important quaternary amines, results in a positively charged nitrogen, and thus a water-soluble, or at least amphiphilic, compound). Larger chains, rings and structures of nitrogen hydrides are also known, but are generally unstable.</p>\n<p>Other classes of nitrogen anions (negatively charged ions) are the poisonous azides (N−\n3), which are linear and isoelectronic to carbon dioxide, but which bind to important iron-containing enzymes in the body in a manner more resembling cyanide. Another molecule of the same structure is the colorless and relatively inert anesthetic gas Nitrous oxide (dinitrogen monoxide, N\n2O), also known as laughing gas. This is one of a variety of nitrogen oxides that form a family often abbreviated as <b>NOx</b>. Nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide, NO), is a natural free radical used in signal transduction in both plants and animals, for example, in vasodilation by causing the smooth muscle of blood vessels to relax. The reddish and poisonous nitrogen dioxide NO\n2 contains an unpaired electron and is an important component of smog. Nitrogen molecules containing unpaired electrons show a tendency to dimerize (thus pairing the electrons), and are, in general, highly reactive. The corresponding acids are nitrous HNO\n2 and nitric acid HNO\n3, with the corresponding salts called nitrites and nitrates.}</p>\n<p>The higher oxides dinitrogen trioxide N\n2O\n3, dinitrogen tetroxide N\n2O\n4 and dinitrogen pentoxide N\n2O\n5, are unstable and explosive, a consequence of the chemical stability of N\n2. Nearly every hypergolic rocket engine uses N\n2O\n4 as the oxidizer; their fuels, various forms of hydrazine, are also nitrogen compounds. These engines are extensively used on spacecraft such as the space shuttle and those of the Apollo Program because their propellants are liquids at room temperature and ignition occurs on contact without an ignition system, allowing many precisely controlled burns. Some launch vehicles such as the Titan II and Ariane 1 through 4 also use hypergolic fuels, although the trend is away from such engines for cost and safety reasons. N\n2O\n4 is an intermediate in the manufacture of nitric acid HNO\n3, one of the few acids stronger than hydronium and a fairly strong oxidizing agent.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen is notable for the range of explosively unstable compounds that it can produce. Nitrogen triiodide NI\n3 is an extremely sensitive contact explosive. Nitrocellulose, produced by nitration of cellulose with nitric acid, is also known as guncotton. Nitroglycerin, made by nitration of glycerin, is the dangerously unstable explosive ingredient of dynamite. The comparatively stable, but less powerful explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT) is the standard explosive against which the power of nuclear explosions are measured.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen can also be found in organic compounds. Common nitrogen functional groups include: amines, amides, nitro groups, imines, and enamines. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA computer rendering of the nitrogen molecule, N</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Nitrogen gas</h3>\n<p>Nitrogen gas has a variety of applications, including serving as an inert replacement for air where oxidation is undesirable;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a modified atmosphere, pure or mixed with carbon dioxide, to preserve the freshness of packaged or bulk foods (by delaying rancidity and other forms of oxidative damage). Pure nitrogen as food additive is labelled in the European Union with the E number E941.</li>\n<li>In ordinary incandescent light bulbs as an inexpensive alternative to argon.</li>\n<li>The production of electronic parts such as transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits.</li>\n<li>Dried and pressurized, as a dielectric gas for high-voltage equipment.</li>\n<li>The manufacturing of stainless steel.</li>\n<li>Used in military aircraft fuel systems to reduce fire hazard, (see inerting system).</li>\n<li>On top of liquid explosives as a safety measure.</li>\n<li>Filling automotive and aircraft tires due to its inertness and lack of moisture or oxidative qualities, as opposed to air. The difference in N content between air and pure N is 20%.</li>\n<li>Used as a propellant for draft wine, and as an alternative to or together with carbon dioxide for other beverages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nitrogen is commonly used during sample preparation procedures for chemical analysis. It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples. Directing a pressurized stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular to the surface of the liquid allows the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute(s) and un-evaporated solvent behind.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns. Nitrogen must be kept at higher pressure than CO, making N tanks heavier and more expensive.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen can be used as a replacement, or in combination with, carbon dioxide to pressurize kegs of some beers, particularly stouts and British ales, due to the smaller bubbles it produces, which makes the dispensed beer smoother and headier. A pressure sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a \"widget\" allows nitrogen charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles.</p>\n<h3>Liquid nitrogen</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-videopayload=\"&lt;div class=&quot;mediaContainer&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;width:320px&quot;&gt;&lt;video id=&quot;mwe_player_1&quot; style=&quot;width:320px;height:240px&quot; poster=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Nitrogen.ogg/320px--Nitrogen.ogg.jpg&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;kskin&quot; data-durationhint=&quot;14.931034482759&quot; data-startoffset=&quot;0&quot; data-mwtitle=&quot;Nitrogen.ogg&quot; data-mwprovider=&quot;wikimediacommons&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Nitrogen.ogg&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg; codecs=&amp;quot;theora&amp;quot;&quot; data-title=&quot;Original Ogg file, 320 × 240 (226 kbps)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;Ogg source&quot; data-width=&quot;320&quot; data-height=&quot;240&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;226105&quot; data-framerate=&quot;29&quot; /&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/b/b6/Nitrogen.ogg/Nitrogen.ogg.360p.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm; codecs=&amp;quot;vp8, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; transcodekey=&quot;360p.webm&quot; data-title=&quot;Web streamable WebM (360P)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;WebM 360P&quot; data-width=&quot;320&quot; data-height=&quot;240&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;518936&quot; data-framerate=&quot;29&quot; /&gt;Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.&lt;br /&gt;\nYou can &lt;a href=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Nitrogen.ogg&quot;&gt;download the clip&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TimedMediaHandler/Client_download&quot;&gt;download a player&lt;/a&gt; to play the clip in your browser.&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAir balloon submerged in liquid nitrogen</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Liquid nitrogen</div>\n<p>Liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid. At atmospheric pressure, it boils at −195.8 °C. When insulated in proper containers such as Dewar flasks, it can be transported without much evaporative loss.</p>\n<p>Like dry ice, the main use of liquid nitrogen is as a refrigerant. Among other things, it is used in the cryopreservation of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials. It is used in the clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation.</p>\n<h3>Nitrogen compounds</h3>\n<p>Molecular nitrogen (N) in the atmosphere is relatively non-reactive due to its strong bond, and N plays an inert role in the human body, being neither produced nor destroyed. In nature, nitrogen is converted into biologically (and industrially) useful compounds by lightning, and by some living organisms, notably certain bacteria (i.e., nitrogen fixing bacteria—see <i>Biological role</i> below). Molecular nitrogen is released into the atmosphere in the process of decay, in dead plant and animal tissues.</p>\n<p>The ability to combine, or fix, molecular nitrogen is a key feature of modern industrial chemistry, where nitrogen and natural gas are converted into ammonia via the Haber process. Ammonia, in turn, can be used directly (primarily as a fertilizer, and in the synthesis of nitrated fertilizers), or as a precursor of many other important materials including explosives, largely via the production of nitric acid by the Ostwald process.</p>\n<p>The organic and inorganic salts of nitric acid have been important historically as convenient stores of chemical energy. They include important compounds such as potassium nitrate (used in gunpowder) and ammonium nitrate, an important fertilizer and explosive (see ANFO). Various other nitrated organic compounds, such as nitroglycerin, trinitrotoluene, and nitrocellulose, are used as explosives and propellants for modern firearms. Nitric acid is used as an oxidizing agent in liquid fueled rockets. Hydrazine and hydrazine derivatives find use as rocket fuels and monopropellants. In most of these compounds, the basic instability and tendency to burn or explode is derived from the fact that nitrogen is present as an oxide, and not as the far more stable nitrogen molecule (N), which is a product of the compounds' thermal decomposition. When nitrates burn or explode, the formation of the powerful triple bond in the N produces most of the energy of the reaction.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen is a constituent of molecules in every major drug class in pharmacology and medicine. Nitrous oxide (NO) was discovered early in the 19th century to be a partial anesthetic, though it was not used as a surgical anesthetic until later. Called \"laughing gas\", it was found capable of inducing a state of social disinhibition resembling drunkenness. Other notable nitrogen-containing drugs are drugs derived from plant alkaloids, such as morphine (there exist many alkaloids known to have pharmacological effects; in some cases, they appear as natural chemical defenses of plants against predation). Drugs that contain nitrogen include all major classes of antibiotics and organic nitrate drugs like nitroglycerin and nitroprusside that regulate blood pressure and heart action by mimicking the action of nitric oxide.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>See also: Nitrogen cycle&nbsp;and Human impacts on the nitrogen cycle</div>\n<p>Nitrogen is an essential building block of amino and nucleic acids, essential to life on Earth.</p>\n<p>Elemental nitrogen in the atmosphere cannot be used directly by either plants or animals, and must be converted to a reduced (or 'fixed') state to be useful for higher plants and animals. Precipitation often contains substantial quantities of ammonium and nitrate, thought to result from nitrogen fixation by lightning and other atmospheric electric phenomena. This was first proposed by Liebig in 1827 and later confirmed. However, because ammonium is preferentially retained by the forest canopy relative to atmospheric nitrate, most fixed nitrogen reaches the soil surface under trees as nitrate. Soil nitrate is preferentially assimilated by tree roots relative to soil ammonium.</p>\n<p>Specific bacteria (e.g., <i>Rhizobium trifolium</i>) possess nitrogenase enzymes that can fix atmospheric nitrogen (see nitrogen fixation) into a form (ammonium ion) that is chemically useful to higher organisms. This process requires a large amount of energy and anoxic conditions. Such bacteria may live freely in soil (e.g., <i>Azotobacter</i>) but normally exist in a symbiotic relationship in the root nodules of leguminous plants (e.g. clover, <i>Trifolium</i>, or soybean plant, <i>Glycine max</i>). Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are also symbiotic with a number of unrelated plant species such as alders (<i>Alnus</i>) spp., lichens, <i>Casuarina</i>, <i>Myrica</i>, liverworts, and <i>Gunnera</i>.</p>\n<p>As part of the symbiotic relationship, the plant converts the 'fixed' ammonium ion to nitrogen oxides and amino acids to form proteins and other molecules, (e.g., alkaloids). In return for the 'fixed' nitrogen, the plant secretes sugars to the symbiotic bacteria. Legumes maintain an anaerobic (oxygen free) environment for their nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>\n<p>Plants are able to assimilate nitrogen directly in the form of nitrates that may be present in soil from natural mineral deposits, artificial fertilizers, animal waste, or organic decay (as the product of bacteria, but not bacteria specifically associated with the plant). Nitrates absorbed in this fashion are converted to nitrites by the enzyme nitrate reductase, and then converted to ammonia by another enzyme called nitrite reductase.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen compounds are basic building blocks in animal biology as well. Animals use nitrogen-containing amino acids from plant sources as starting materials for all nitrogen-compound animal biochemistry, including the manufacture of proteins and nucleic acids. Plant-feeding insects are dependent on nitrogen in their diet, such that varying the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to a plant can affect the reproduction rate of insects feeding on fertilized plants.</p>\n<p>Soluble nitrate is an important limiting factor in the growth of certain bacteria in ocean waters. In many places in the world, artificial fertilizers applied to crop-lands to increase yields result in run-off delivery of soluble nitrogen to oceans at river mouths. This process can result in eutrophication of the water, as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die. Well-known \"dead zone\" areas in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Black Sea are due to this important polluting process.</p>\n<p>Many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of trimethylamine oxide to protect them from the high osmotic effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odor in unfresh saltwater fish. In animals, free radical nitric oxide (<b>NO</b>) (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.</p>\n<p>Nitric oxide's rapid reaction with water in animals results in production of its metabolite nitrite. Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid. The characteristic odor of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long-chain, nitrogen-containing amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine, which are breakdown products of the amino acids ornithine and lysine, respectively, in decaying proteins.</p>\n<p>Decay of organisms and their waste products may produce small amounts of nitrate, but most decay eventually returns nitrogen content to the atmosphere, as molecular nitrogen. The circulation of nitrogen from atmosphere, to organic compounds, then back to the atmosphere, is referred to as the nitrogen cycle.</p>\n<h2>Safety</h2>\n<p>Rapid release of nitrogen gas into an enclosed space can displace oxygen, and therefore represents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid body is a relatively slow and a poor low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before the launch of the first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians lost consciousness (and one of them died) after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurized with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire. The technicians would have been able to exit the room if they had experienced early symptoms from nitrogen-breathing.</p>\n<p>When inhaled at high partial pressures (more than about 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30 m in scuba diving), nitrogen begins to act as an anesthetic agent. It can cause nitrogen narcosis, a temporary semi-anesthetized state of mental impairment similar to that caused by nitrous oxide.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen also dissolves in the bloodstream and body fats. Rapid decompression (in particular, in the case of divers ascending too quickly, or astronauts decompressing too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure) can lead to a potentially fatal condition called decompression sickness (formerly known as caisson sickness or <i>the bends</i>), when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream, nerves, joints, and other sensitive or vital areas. Bubbles from other \"inert\" gases (those gases other than carbon dioxide and oxygen) cause the same effects, so replacement of nitrogen in breathing gases may prevent nitrogen narcosis, but does not prevent decompression sickness.</p>\n<p>Direct skin contact with liquid nitrogen will cause severe frostbite (cryogenic \"burns\"). This may happen almost instantly on contact, or after a second or more, depending on the form of liquid nitrogen. Bulk liquid nitrogen causes less rapid freezing than a spray of nitrogen mist (such as is used to freeze certain skin growths in the practice of dermatology). The extra surface area provided by nitrogen-soaked materials is also important, with soaked clothing or cotton causing far more rapid damage than a spill of direct liquid to skin. Full \"contact\" between naked skin and large collected-droplets or pools of liquid nitrogen may be prevented for a second or two, by a layer of insulating gas from the Leidenfrost effect. This may give the skin a second of protection from nitrogen bulk liquid.

  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element and its most stable form, O\n2 or dioxygen.  For other forms of this element, see Allotropes of oxygen.  For other uses, see Oxygen (disambiguation) and O2 (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBlue white glow from an oxygen discharge tube.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><b>Oxygen</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>O</b> and atomic number&nbsp;8. Its name derives from the Greek roots ὀξύς (oxys) (\"acid\", literally \"sharp\", referring to the sour taste of acids) and -γόνος (-gοnos) (\"producer\", literally \"begetter\"), because at the time of naming, it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless, odorless, tasteless diatomic gas with the formula O\n2. This substance is an important part of the atmosphere, and is necessary to sustain most terrestrial life.</p>\n<p>Oxygen is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetallic element that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most elements except the noble gases Helium and Neon. Oxygen is a strong oxidizing agent and only fluorine has greater electronegativity. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium and the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust, making up almost half of the crust's mass. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in Earth's atmosphere without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms, which use the energy of sunlight to produce elemental oxygen from water. Free elemental O\n2 only began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago (see Great oxygenation event) about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the volume of air.</p>\n<p>Oxygen constitutes most of the mass of living organisms, because water is their major constituent (for example, about two-thirds of human body mass). Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats, contain oxygen, as do the major inorganic compounds that are constituents of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Elemental oxygen is produced by cyanobacteria, algae and plants, and is used in cellular respiration for all complex life. Oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms, which were the dominant form of early life on Earth until O\n2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O\n3), strongly absorbs UVB radiation and consequently the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation, but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog. At even higher low earth orbit altitudes, atomic oxygen is a significant presence and a cause of erosion for spacecraft.</p>\n<p>Oxygen was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774, but Priestley is often given priority because his work was published first. The name <i>oxygen</i> was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion. Oxygen is produced industrially by fractional distillation of liquefied air, use of zeolites with pressure-cycling to concentrate oxygen from air, electrolysis of water and other means. Uses of elemental oxygen include the production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Structure</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOxygen O molecule.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>At standard temperature and pressure, oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas with the molecular formula O\n2, in which the two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other with a spin triplet electron configuration. This bond has a bond order of two, and is often simplified in description as a double bond or as a combination of one two-electron bond and two three-electron bonds.</p>\n<p>Triplet oxygen (not to be confused with ozone, O\n3) is the ground state of the O\n2 molecule. The electron configuration of the molecule has two unpaired electrons occupying two degenerate molecular orbitals. These orbitals are classified as antibonding (weakening the bond order from three to two), so the diatomic oxygen bond is weaker than the diatomic nitrogen triple bond in which all bonding molecular orbitals are filled, but some antibonding orbitals are not.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA trickle of liquid oxygen is deflected by a magnetic field, illustrating its paramagnetic property</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In normal triplet form, O\n2 molecules are paramagnetic. That is, they form a magnet in the presence of a magnetic field—because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the negative exchange energy between neighboring O\n2 molecules. Liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that, in laboratory demonstrations, a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet.</p>\n<p>Singlet oxygen is a name given to several higher-energy species of molecular O\n2 in which all the electron spins are paired. It is much more reactive towards common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se. In nature, singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis, using the energy of sunlight. It is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength, and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen. Carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms (and possibly also in animals) play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues.</p>\n<h3>Allotropes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Allotropes of oxygen</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOzone is a rare gas on Earth found mostly in the stratosphere.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The common allotrope of elemental oxygen on Earth is called dioxygen, O\n2. It has a bond length of 121&nbsp;pm and a bond energy of 498&nbsp;kJ·mol. This is the form that is used by complex forms of life, such as animals, in cellular respiration (see Biological role) and is the form that is a major part of the Earth's atmosphere (see Occurrence). Other aspects of O\n2 are covered in the remainder of this article.</p>\n<p>Trioxygen (O\n3) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue. Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O\n2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O\n2 by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet. Near the Earth's surface, however, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O\n4) was discovered in 2001, and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen. It was proven in 2006 that this phase, created by pressurizing O\n2 to 20&nbsp;GPa, is in fact a rhombohedral O\n8 cluster. This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O\n2 or O\n3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel. A metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 GPa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures, this phase becomes superconducting.</p>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>See also: Liquid oxygen&nbsp;and solid oxygen</div>\n<p>Oxygen is more soluble in water than nitrogen is. Water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved O\n2 for every 2 molecules of N\n2, compared to an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1:4. The solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent, and about twice as much (14.6&nbsp;mg·L) dissolves at 0&nbsp;°C than at 20&nbsp;°C (7.6&nbsp;mg·L). At 25&nbsp;°C and 1 standard atmosphere (101.3&nbsp;kPa) of air, freshwater contains about 6.04&nbsp;milliliters&nbsp;(mL) of oxygen per liter, whereas seawater contains about 4.95&nbsp;mL per liter. At 5&nbsp;°C the solubility increases to 9.0&nbsp;mL (50% more than at 25&nbsp;°C) per liter for water and 7.2&nbsp;mL (45% more) per liter for sea water.</p>\n<p>Oxygen condenses at 90.20&nbsp;K (−182.95&nbsp;°C, −297.31&nbsp;°F), and freezes at 54.36&nbsp;K (−218.79&nbsp;°C, −361.82&nbsp;°F). Both liquid and solid O\n2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red (in contrast with the blue color of the sky, which is due to Rayleigh scattering of blue light). High-purity liquid O\n2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air. Liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air, using liquid nitrogen as a coolant. It is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes and stellar origin</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of oxygen</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLate in a massive star's life, O concentrates in the O-shell, O in the H-shell and O in the He-shell.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring oxygen is composed of three stable isotopes, O, O, and O, with O being the most abundant (99.762% natural abundance).</p>\n<p>Most O is synthesized at the end of the helium fusion process in massive stars but some is made in the neon burning process. O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO cycle, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars. Most O is produced when N (made abundant from CNO burning) captures a He nucleus, making O common in the helium-rich zones of evolved, massive stars.</p>\n<p>Fourteen radioisotopes have been characterized. The most stable are O with a half-life of 122.24&nbsp;seconds and O with a half-life of 70.606&nbsp;seconds. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 27&nbsp;s and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 83&nbsp;milliseconds. The most common decay mode of the isotopes lighter than O is β decay to yield nitrogen, and the most common mode for the isotopes heavier than O is beta decay to yield fluorine.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also: Silicate minerals, Category:Oxide minerals, Stellar population, Cosmochemistry,&nbsp;and Astrochemistry</div>\n\n<p>Oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth's biosphere, air, sea and land. Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. About 0.9% of the Sun's mass is oxygen. Oxygen constitutes 49.2% of the Earth's crust by mass and is the major component of the world's oceans (88.8% by mass). Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the Earth's atmosphere, taking up 20.8% of its volume and 23.1% of its mass (some 10 tonnes). Earth is unusual among the planets of the Solar System in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere: Mars (with 0.1% O\n2 by volume) and Venus have far lower concentrations. However, the O\n2 surrounding these other planets is produced solely by ultraviolet radiation impacting oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide.</p>\n<p>The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration and decay remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1/2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCold water holds more dissolved O\n2.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of O\n2 at lower temperatures (see Physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content. Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of O\n2 in eutrophic water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of O\n2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration.</p>\n<h2>Biological role of O</h2>\n<div>Main article: Dioxygen in biological reactions</div>\n<h3>Photosynthesis and respiration</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPhotosynthesis splits water to liberate O\n2 and fixes CO\n2 into sugar in what is called a Calvin cycle.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In nature, free oxygen is produced by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, Green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.</p>\n<p>A simplified overall formula for photosynthesis is:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>6 CO + 6 H\n2O + photons → C\n6H\n12O\n6 + 6 O\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>or simply</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>carbon dioxide + water + sunlight → glucose + dioxygen</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Photolytic oxygen evolution occurs in the thylakoid membranes of photosynthetic organisms and requires the energy of four photons. Many steps are involved, but the result is the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is used to synthesize ATP via photophosphorylation. The O\n2 remaining after oxidation of the water molecule is released into the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Molecular dioxygen, O\n2, is essential for cellular respiration in all aerobic organisms. Oxygen is used in mitochondria to help generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during oxidative phosphorylation. The reaction for aerobic respiration is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis and is simplified as:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>C\n6H\n12O\n6 + 6 O\n2 → 6 CO + 6 H\n2O + 2880 kJ·mol</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In vertebrates, O\n2 diffuses through membranes in the lungs and into red blood cells. Hemoglobin binds O\n2, changing its color from bluish red to bright red (CO\n2 is released from another part of hemoglobin through the Bohr effect). Other animals use hemocyanin (molluscs and some arthropods) or hemerythrin (spiders and lobsters). A liter of blood can dissolve 200&nbsp;cm of O\n2.</p>\n<p>Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide ion (O−\n2) and hydrogen peroxide (H\n2O\n2), are dangerous by-products of oxygen use in organisms. Parts of the immune system of higher organisms, however, create peroxide, superoxide, and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes. Reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack.</p>\n<p>An adult human in rest inhales 1.8 to 2.4&nbsp;grams of oxygen per minute. This amounts to more than 6 billion tonnes of oxygen inhaled by humanity per year.</p>\n<h3>Content in body</h3>\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The free oxygen partial pressure in the body of a living vertebrate organism is highest in the respiratory system, and decreases along any arterial system, peripheral tissues and venous system, respectively. Partial pressure is the pressure which oxygen would have if it alone occupied the volume.</p>\n<h3>Build-up in the atmosphere</h3>\n<div>Main article: Geological history of oxygen</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nO\n2 build-up in Earth's atmosphere: 1) no O\n2 produced; 2) O\n2 produced, but absorbed in oceans &amp; seabed rock; 3) O\n2 starts to gas out of the oceans, but is absorbed by land surfaces and formation of ozone layer; 4–5) O\n2 sinks filled and the gas accumulates</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in Earth's atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 2.5 and 1.6 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 2.7&nbsp;billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7&nbsp;billion years ago.</p>\n<p>The presence of large amounts of dissolved and free oxygen in the oceans and atmosphere may have driven most of the anaerobic organisms then living to extinction during the Great Oxygenation Event (<i>oxygen catastrophe</i>) about 2.4 billion years ago. However, cellular respiration using O\n2 enables aerobic organisms to produce much more ATP than anaerobic organisms, helping the former to dominate Earth's biosphere. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration of O\n2 allowed for the evolution of eukaryotic cells and ultimately complex multicellular organisms such as plants and animals.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the Cambrian period 540 million years ago, O\n2 levels have fluctuated between 15% and 30% by volume. Towards the end of the Carboniferous period (about 300&nbsp;million years ago) atmospheric O\n2 levels reached a maximum of 35% by volume, which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at this time. Human activities, including the burning of 7&nbsp;billion tonnes of fossil fuels each year have had very little effect on the amount of free oxygen in the atmosphere. At the current rate of photosynthesis it would take about 2,000&nbsp;years to regenerate the entire O\n2 in the present atmosphere.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Early experiments</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPhilo's experiment inspired later investigators.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century&nbsp;BCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. In his work <i>Pneumatica</i>, Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck. Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.</p>\n<p>In the late 17th&nbsp;century, Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist John Mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called <i>spiritus nitroaereus</i> or just <i>nitroaereus</i>. In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.</p>\n<p>Mayow observed that antimony increased in weight when heated, and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it. He also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body. Accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in 1668 in his work <i>Tractatus duo</i> in the tract \"De respiratione\".</p>\n<h3>Phlogiston theory</h3>\n<div>Main article: Phlogiston theory</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStahl helped develop and popularize the phlogiston theory.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Robert Hooke, Ole Borch, Mikhail Lomonosov, and Pierre Bayen&nbsp;(fr) all produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th and the 18th century but none of them recognized it as a chemical element. This may have been in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of combustion and corrosion called the phlogiston theory, which was then the favored explanation of those processes.</p>\n<p>Established in 1667 by the German alchemist J. J. Becher, and modified by the chemist Georg Ernst Stahl by 1731, phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts. One part, called phlogiston, was given off when the substance containing it was burned, while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form, or calx.</p>\n<p>Highly combustible materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston; whereas non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process. The fact that a substance like wood actually <i>gains</i> overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products. Indeed one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals, too, gain weight in rusting (when they were supposedly losing phlogiston).</p>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCarl Wilhelm Scheele beat Priestley to the discovery but published afterwards.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Oxygen was first discovered by Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. He had produced oxygen gas by heating mercuric oxide and various nitrates by about 1772. Scheele called the gas \"fire air\" because it was the only known supporter of combustion, and wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript he titled <i>Treatise on Air and Fire</i>, which he sent to his publisher in 1775. However, that document was not published until 1777.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nJoseph Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named \"dephlogisticated air\". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: \"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled <i>Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air</i>. Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.</p>\n<p>The noted French chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently. However, Priestley visited Lavoisier in October 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas. Scheele also posted a letter to Lavoisier on September 30, 1774 that described his own discovery of the previously unknown substance, but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it (a copy of the letter was found in Scheele's belongings after his death).</p>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Lavoisier's contribution</h3>\n<p>What Lavoisier did indisputably do (although this was disputed at the time) was to conduct the first adequate quantitative experiments on oxidation and give the first correct explanation of how combustion works. He used these and similar experiments, all started in 1774, to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by Priestley and Scheele was a chemical element.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAntoine Lavoisier discredited the Phlogiston theory.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container. He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book <i>Sur la combustion en général</i>, which was published in 1777. In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and <i>azote</i> (Gk. <i>ἄζωτον</i> \"lifeless\"), which did not support either. <i>Azote</i> later became <i>nitrogen</i> in English, although it has kept the name in French and several other European languages.</p>\n<p>Lavoisier renamed 'vital air' to <i>oxygène</i> in 1777 from the Greek roots <i>ὀξύς (oxys)</i> (acid, literally \"sharp\", from the taste of acids) and <i>-γενής (-genēs)</i> (producer, literally begetter), because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids. Chemists (notably Sir Humphry Davy in 1812) eventually determined that Lavoisier was wrong in this regard (it is in fact hydrogen that forms the basis for acid chemistry), but by that time it was too late; the name had taken.</p>\n<p><i>Oxygen</i> entered the English language despite opposition by English scientists and the fact that the Englishman Priestley had first isolated the gas and written about it. This is partly due to a poem praising the gas titled \"Oxygen\" in the popular book <i>The Botanic Garden</i> (1791) by Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Later history</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRobert H. Goddard and a liquid oxygen-gasoline rocket</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>John Dalton's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monoatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules.</p>\n<p>By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied, and its components isolated, by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in either case so no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in stable state for the first time on March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.</p>\n<p>In 1891 Scottish chemist James Dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen to study. The first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by German engineer Carl von Linde and British engineer William Hampson. Both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them. Later, in 1901, oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed O\n2. This method of welding and cutting metal later became common.</p>\n<p>In 1923 the American scientist Robert H. Goddard became the first person to develop a rocket engine that burned liquid fuel; the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. Goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56&nbsp;m at 97&nbsp;km/h on March 16, 1926 in Auburn, Massachusetts, USA.</p>\n<h2>Industrial production</h2>\n<div>See also: Air separation, Oxygen evolution,&nbsp;and fractional distillation</div>\n<p>Two major methods are employed to produce 100&nbsp;million&nbsp;tonnes of O\n2 extracted from air for industrial uses annually. The most common method is to fractionally distill liquefied air into its various components, with N\n2 distilling as a vapor while O\n2 is left as a liquid.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHofmann electrolysis apparatus used in electrolysis of water.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The other major method of producing O\n2 gas involves passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90%&nbsp;to&nbsp;93% O\n2. Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as pressure swing adsorption. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies (see also the related vacuum swing adsorption).</p>\n<p>Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. Contrary to popular belief, the 2:1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is HO unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves. A similar method is the electrocatalytic O\n2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids. Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies. Another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure O\n2 gas.</p>\n<p>In large quantities, the price of liquid oxygen in 2001 was approximately $0.21/kg. Since the primary cost of production is the energy cost of liquefying the air, the production cost will change as energy cost varies.</p>\n<p>For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one litre of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840&nbsp;liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68&nbsp;°F). Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>See also: Breathing gas, Redox,&nbsp;and Combustion</div>\n<h3>Medical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAn oxygen concentrator in an emphysema patient's house</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Oxygen therapy</div>\n<p>Uptake of O\n2 from the air is the essential purpose of respiration, so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine. Treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart. Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen.</p>\n<p>Treatments are flexible enough to be used in hospitals, the patient's home, or increasingly by portable devices. Oxygen tents were once commonly used in oxygen supplementation, but have since been replaced mostly by the use of oxygen masks or nasal cannulas.</p>\n<p>Hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O\n2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff. Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes treated using these devices. Increased O\n2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. Increasing the pressure of O\n2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment.</p>\n<p>Oxygen is also used medically for patients who require mechanical ventilation, often at concentrations above the 21% found in ambient air.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Life support and recreational use</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLow pressure pure O\n2 is used in space suits.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A notable application of O\n2 as a low-pressure breathing gas is in modern space suits, which surround their occupant's body with pressurized air. These devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one third normal pressure, resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of O\n2. This trade-off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain flexible spacesuits.</p>\n<p>Scuba divers and submariners also rely on artificially delivered O\n2, but most often use normal pressure, and/or mixtures of oxygen and air. Pure or nearly pure O\n2 use in diving at higher-than-sea-level pressures is usually limited to rebreather, decompression, or emergency treatment use at relatively shallow depths (~6 meters depth, or less). Deeper diving requires significant dilution of O\n2 with other gases, such as nitrogen or helium, to help prevent oxygen toxicity.</p>\n<p>People who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized fixed-wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental O\n2 supplies. Passengers traveling in (pressurized) commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of O\n2 automatically supplied to them in case of cabin depressurization. Sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat, causing oxygen masks to drop. Pulling on the masks \"to start the flow of oxygen\" as cabin safety instructions dictate, forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister. A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction.</p>\n<p>Oxygen, as a supposed mild euphoric, has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports. Oxygen bars are establishments, found in Japan, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal O\n2 exposure for a fee. Professional athletes, especially in American football, also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a \"boost\" in performance. The pharmacological effect is doubtful; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation. Available studies support a performance boost from enriched O\n2 mixtures only if they are breathed <i>during</i> aerobic exercise.</p>\n<p>Other recreational uses that do not involve breathing the gas include pyrotechnic applications, such as George Goble's five-second ignition of barbecue grills.</p>\n<h3>Industrial</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMost commercially produced O\n2 is used to smelt iron into steel.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Smelting of iron ore into steel consumes 55% of commercially produced oxygen. In this process, O\n2 is injected through a high-pressure lance into molten iron, which removes sulfur impurities and excess carbon as the respective oxides, SO\n2 and CO\n2. The reactions are exothermic, so the temperature increases to 1,700&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<p>Another 25% of commercially produced oxygen is used by the chemical industry. Ethylene is reacted with O\n2 to create ethylene oxide, which, in turn, is converted into ethylene glycol; the primary feeder material used to manufacture a host of products, including antifreeze and polyester polymers (the precursors of many plastics and fabrics).</p>\n<p>Most of the remaining 20% of commercially produced oxygen is used in medical applications, metal cutting and welding, as an oxidizer in rocket fuel, and in water treatment. Oxygen is used in oxyacetylene welding burning acetylene with O\n2 to produce a very hot flame. In this process, metal up to 60&nbsp;cm thick is first heated with a small oxy-acetylene flame and then quickly cut by a large stream of O\n2. Larger rockets use liquid oxygen as their oxidizer, which is mixed and ignited with the fuel for propulsion.</p>\n<h3>Scientific</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n500 million years of climate change vs O</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine what the climate was like millions of years ago (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18; this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples that are up to several hundreds of thousands of years old.</p>\n<p>Planetary geologists have measured different abundances of oxygen isotopes in samples from the Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun, believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar nebula. However, analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.</p>\n<p>Oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760&nbsp;nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.<br></p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>Main article: Compounds of oxygen</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWater (H\n2O) is the most familiar oxygen compound.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The oxidation state of oxygen is −2 in almost all known compounds of oxygen. The oxidation state −1 is found in a few compounds such as peroxides. Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon: −1/2 (superoxides), −1/3 (ozonides), 0 (elemental, hypofluorous acid), +1/2 (dioxygenyl), +1 (dioxygen difluoride), and +2 (oxygen difluoride).</p>\n<h3>Oxides and other inorganic compounds</h3>\n<p>Water (H\n2O) is the oxide of hydrogen and the most familiar oxygen compound. Hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3&nbsp;kJ·mol per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule. These hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15% closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der Waals forces.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOxides, such as iron oxide or rust form when oxygen combines with other elements.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements at elevated temperatures to give corresponding oxides. However, some elements readily form oxides at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the rusting of iron is an example. The surface of metals like aluminium and titanium are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Some of the transition metal oxides are found in nature as non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the natural occurring FeO (wüstite) is actually written as Fe\n1&nbsp;−&nbsp;xO, where <i>x</i> is usually around 0.05.</p>\n<p>Oxygen as a compound is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO\n2). The Earth's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon (silica SiO\n2, found in granite and sand), aluminium (aluminium oxide Al\n2O\n3, in bauxite and corundum), iron (iron(III) oxide Fe\n2O\n3, in hematite and rust), and calcium carbonate (in limestone). The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex silicates (in silicate minerals). The Earth's mantle, of much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.</p>\n<p>Water-soluble silicates in the form of Na\n4SiO\n4, Na\n2SiO\n3, and Na\n2Si\n2O\n5 are used as detergents and adhesives.</p>\n<p>Oxygen also acts as a ligand for transition metals, forming metal–O\n2 bonds with the iridium atom in Vaska's complex, with the platinum in PtF\n6, and with the iron center of the heme group of hemoglobin.</p>\n<h3>Organic compounds and biomolecules</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAcetone is an important feeder material in the chemical industry.\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oxygen</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Carbon</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydrogen</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOxygen represents more than 40% of the molecular mass of the ATP molecule.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where \"R\" is an organic group): alcohols (R-OH); ethers (R-O-R); ketones (R-CO-R); aldehydes (R-CO-H); carboxylic acids (R-COOH); esters (R-COO-R); acid anhydrides (R-CO-O-CO-R); and amides (R-C(O)-NR\n2). There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen, including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, furan, THF, diethyl ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, DMF, DMSO, acetic acid, and formic acid. Acetone ((CH\n3)\n2CO) and phenol (C\n6H\n5OH) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: glycerol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, acetic anhydride, and acetamide. Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms.</p>\n<p>Oxygen reacts spontaneously with many organic compounds at or below room temperature in a process called autoxidation. Most of the organic compounds that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of O\n2. Organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include ethylene oxide and peracetic acid.</p>\n<p>The element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to (or generated by) life. Only a few common complex biomolecules, such as squalene and the carotenes, contain no oxygen. Of the organic compounds with biological relevance, carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen. All fats, fatty acids, amino acids, and proteins contain oxygen (due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues). Oxygen also occurs in phosphate (PO3−\n4) groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules ATP and ADP, in the backbone and the purines (except adenine) and pyrimidines of RNA and DNA, and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite.</p>\n<h2>Safety and precautions</h2>\n<p>The NFPA 704 standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated liquid oxygen (LOX) is given a health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form.</p>\n<h3>Toxicity</h3>\n<div>Main article: Oxygen toxicity</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMain symptoms of oxygen toxicity</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOxygen toxicity occurs when the lungs take in a higher than normal O\n2 partial pressure, which can occur in deep scuba diving.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Oxygen gas (O\n2) can be toxic at elevated partial pressures, leading to convulsions and other health problems. Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals&nbsp;(kPa), equal to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level O\n2 partial pressure of about 21&nbsp;kPa. This is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators, since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%–50% O\n2 by volume (about 30&nbsp;kPa at standard pressure). (although this figure also is subject to wide variation, depending on type of mask).</p>\n<p>At one time, premature babies were placed in incubators containing O\n2-rich air, but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high.</p>\n<p>Breathing pure O\n2 in space applications, such as in some modern space suits, or in early spacecraft such as Apollo, causes no damage due to the low total pressures used. In the case of spacesuits, the O\n2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is, in general, about 30&nbsp;kPa (1.4 times normal), and the resulting O\n2 partial pressure in the astronaut's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level O\n2 partial pressure (for more information on this, see space suit and arterial blood gas).</p>\n<p>Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving. Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an O\n2 partial pressure more than 60&nbsp;kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure to a O\n2 partial pressures greater than 160&nbsp;kPa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers). Acute oxygen toxicity (causing seizures, its most feared effect for divers) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21% O\n2 at 66&nbsp;m or more of depth; the same thing can occur by breathing 100% O\n2 at only 6&nbsp;m.</p>\n<h3>Combustion and other hazards</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe interior of the Apollo 1 Command Module. Pure O\n2 at higher than normal pressure and a spark led to a fire and the loss of the Apollo 1 crew.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; however, an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, is needed to trigger combustion. Oxygen itself is not the fuel, but the oxidant. Combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential, such as peroxides, chlorates, nitrates, perchlorates, and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire.</p>\n<p>Concentrated O\n2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically. Steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel; and therefore the design and manufacture of O\n2 systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized. The fire that killed the Apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure O\n2 but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure, instead of the ⁄ normal pressure that would be used in a mission.</p>\n<p>Liquid oxygen spills, if allowed to soak into organic matter, such as wood, petrochemicals, and asphalt can cause these materials to detonate unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact. As with other cryogenic liquids, on contact with the human body it can cause frostbites to the skin and the eyes.</p>\n<div></div>\n"

  "title": "Fluorine",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Fluorine</b> is the chemical element with symbol <b>F</b> and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and has a single stable isotope, fluorine-19. At standard pressure and temperature, fluorine is a pale yellow gas composed of diatomic molecules, F. Fluorine is the most electronegative element. It is also the most reactive of all the elements, requiring great care in handling. The compounds of fluorine are called fluorides.</p>\n<p>In stars, fluorine is rare compared to other light elements. In Earth's crust, fluorine is the thirteenth-most abundant element. Fluorine's most important mineral, fluorite, was first formally described in 1529 in the context of smelting. The mineral's name derives from the Latin verb <i>fluo</i>, meaning \"flow\", because fluorite was added to metal ores to lower their melting points. Suggested as a chemical element in 1811, fluorine was named after the source mineral. The dangerous element resisted many attempts to isolate it, but in 1886, French chemist Henri Moissan succeeded. His method of electrolysis remains the industrial production method for fluorine gas. The largest use of elemental fluorine, uranium enrichment, was developed during the Manhattan Project.</p>\n<p>Because of the difficulty in making elemental fluorine, most fluorine used in commerce is never converted to the free element. Instead, hydrofluoric acid is the key intermediate for the US$16 billion-per-year, global fluorochemical industry. The largest uses of inorganic fluorides are steel making and aluminium refining. Organofluorides tend to have high chemical and thermal stability. The largest commercial use is in refrigerant gases; even though traditional chlorofluorocarbons are banned, the replacements still contain fluorine. Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) is the most important fluoropolymer and is used in electrical insulation and cookware.</p>\n<p>While a few plants and bacteria synthesize organofluorine poisons, fluorine has no metabolic role in mammals. The fluoride ion, when directly applied to teeth, reduces decay and for this reason is used in toothpaste and water fluoridation. A growing fraction of modern pharmaceuticals contain fluorine; Lipitor and Prozac are prominent examples.</p>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Phases</h3>\n<div>Main article: Phases of fluorine</div>\n<p>Fluorine forms diatomic molecules (F) that are gaseous at room temperature. Though sometimes cited as yellow-green, pure fluorine gas is actually a very pale yellow. The color can only be observed in concentrated fluorine gas when looking down the axis of long tubes as it appears transparent when observed from the side in normal tubes or if allowed to escape into the atmosphere. The element has a \"pungent\" characteristic odor that is noticeable in concentrations as low as 20&nbsp;ppb.</p>\n<p>Fluorine condenses to a bright yellow liquid at −188&nbsp;°C (−307&nbsp;°F), which is near the condensation temperatures of oxygen and nitrogen. It solidifies at −220&nbsp;°C (−363&nbsp;°F) into a cubic structure called beta-fluorine. This phase is transparent and soft with significant disorder of the molecules. At −228&nbsp;°C (−378&nbsp;°F) fluorine undergoes a solid–solid phase transition into a monoclinic structure called alpha-fluorine. This phase is opaque and hard with close-packed, shingled, layers of molecules. The solid state phase change requires more energy than the melting point transition and can be violent, shattering samples and blowing out sample holder windows. In general, fluorine's solid state is more similar to oxygen's than to the other halogens'.</p>\n\n<h3>Atomic structure</h3>\n<p>A fluorine atom has nine protons and nine electrons, one fewer than neon, arranged in the electronic configuration [He] 2s 2p. Fluorine's outer electrons are relatively separate from each other, and thus they do not shield each other from the nucleus. Therefore, they experience a high effective nuclear charge. Fluorine has a relatively small covalent radius, around 60&nbsp;picometers. This makes fluorine atoms similar in size to those of oxygen and neon.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of the fluorine atom</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Fluorine is reluctant to ionize. Instead, it exhibits a very strong preference for one more electron to achieve the extremely stable neon-like electron configuration. Fluorine's ionization energy (energy required to remove an electron to form F) is higher than that of any element except neon or helium. Fluorine's electron affinity (energy released by adding an electron to form F) is higher than that of any element except chlorine.</p>\n<h3>Molecular structure</h3>\n<div>Main article: Difluorine</div>\n<p>While an individual fluorine atom has one unpaired electron, molecular fluorine has all the electrons paired. This makes it diamagnetic (slightly repelled by magnets). In contrast, neighboring element oxygen, with two unpaired electrons per molecule, is paramagnetic (attracted to magnets).</p>\n<p>The fluorine–fluorine bond of the difluorine molecule is relatively weak. The bond energy is much less than those of Cl or Br molecules and similar to the easily cleaved oxygen–oxygen bonds of peroxides or nitrogen–nitrogen bonds of hydrazines.</p>\n<h3>Chemical reactivity</h3>\n<div>Main article: Chemical characteristics of fluorine</div>\n<p>Fluorine's chemistry is dominated by its strong tendency to gain an electron. It is the most electronegative element, and elemental fluorine is a strong oxidant. The removal of an electron from a fluorine atom requires so much energy that no reagents oxidize fluorine to a positive oxidation state.</p>\n\n<p>Reactions with elemental fluorine are often sudden or explosive. Many substances that are generally regarded as unreactive—such as powdered steel, glass fragments, and asbestos fibers—are readily consumed by cold fluorine gas. Wood and even water burn with flames when subjected to a jet of fluorine, without the need for a spark.</p>\n<p>Reactions of elemental fluorine with metals require different conditions that depend on the metal. Many — such as aluminium, iron, and copper — must be powdered to overcome the protective metal fluoride layers formed by passivation. The alkali metals, such as sodium, react with a bang. The alkaline earth metals, such as calcium, react not quite as dramatically. The noble metals gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium react least readily, requiring pure fluorine gas at 300–450&nbsp;°C (575–850&nbsp;°F).</p>\n<p>Fluorine reacts explosively with hydrogen in a manner similar to that of alkali metals. The other halogens react readily with fluorine gas as does the heavy noble gas radon. The lighter noble gases xenon and krypton can be made to react with fluorine under special conditions, while argon will undergo chemical trasformations only with hydrogen fluoride. Nitrogen, with its very stable triple bonds, requires electric discharge and high temperatures to combine with fluorine directly.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of fluorine</div>\n<p>Fluorine occurs naturally on Earth exclusively in the form of its only stable isotope, fluorine-19, which makes the element monoisotopic and mononuclidic. These characteristics are a key in fluorine's usefulness in uranium enrichment and in nuclear magnetic resonance.</p>\n<p>Seventeen radioisotopes have been synthesized: mass numbers 14–18 and 20–31. Fluorine-18 is the most stable radioisotope of fluorine, with a half-life of 109.77&nbsp;minutes. The lightest fluorine isotopes, those with mass numbers of 14–16, decay via electron capture. F and F undergo beta plus decay (positron emission). All isotopes heavier than the stable fluorine-19 decay by beta minus mode (electron emission), while some also decay by neutron emission.</p>\n<h2>Origin and occurrence</h2>\n<div>Main article: Origin and occurrence of fluorine</div>\n<h3>In the universe</h3>\n\n<p>From the perspective of cosmology, fluorine is relatively rare with 400&nbsp;ppb in the universe. Within stars, any fluorine that is created is rapidly eliminated through nuclear fusion: either with hydrogen to form oxygen and helium, or with helium to make neon and hydrogen. The presence of fluorine at all—outside of temporary existence in stars—is somewhat of a mystery because of the need to escape these fluorine-destroying reactions.</p>\n<p>Three theoretical solutions to the mystery exist. In type II supernovae, atoms of neon could be hit by neutrinos during the explosion and converted to fluorine. In Wolf-Rayet stars (blue stars over 40 times heavier than the Sun), a strong solar wind could blow the fluorine out of the star before hydrogen or helium can destroy it. In asymptotic giant branch (a type of red giant) stars, pulses of fusion reactions could allow convection to lift fluorine out of the inner star. Only the red giant hypothesis has supporting evidence from observations.</p>\n<h3>On Earth</h3>\n<div>See also: List of countries by fluorite production</div>\n<p>Fluorine is the thirteenth most common element in Earth's crust, comprising between 600 and 700&nbsp;ppm of the crust by mass. Because of its reactivity, it is essentially only found in compounds. Three minerals exist that are industrially relevant sources: fluorite, fluorapatite, and cryolite.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Fluorite</b> (CaF), also called fluorspar, is the main source of commercial fluorine. Fluorite is a colorful mineral associated with hydrothermal deposits. It is common and found worldwide. China supplies more than half of the world's demand; Mexico is the second-largest producer. The United States produced most of the world's fluorite in the early 20th century, but its last mine, in Illinois, shut down in 1995.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Fluorapatite</b> (Ca(PO)F) is mined along with other apatites for its phosphate content and is used mostly for production of fertilizers. Most of the Earth's fluorine is bound in this mineral, but because the percentage within the mineral is low (3.5%), the fluorine is discarded as waste. Only in the United States is there significant recovery. There the hexafluorosilicates produced as byproducts are used to supply water fluoridation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Cryolite</b> (NaAlF) is the least abundant of the three but is a concentrated source of fluorine. It was formerly used directly in aluminium production. However, the main commercial mine, on the west coast of Greenland, closed in 1987.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>Main article: History of fluorine</div>\n<h3>Early discoveries</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSteelmaking illustration, Agricola text</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The word \"fluorine\" derives from the Latin stem of the main source mineral, fluorite, which was first mentioned in 1529 by Georgius Agricola, who described it as a flux—an additive that helps lower the melt temperature during smelting. Agricola, the \"father of minerology\", invented several hundred new terms in his Latin works describing 16th century industry. For fluorite rocks (<i>schöne Flüsse</i> in the German of the time), he created the Latin noun <i>fluorés</i>, from <i>fluo</i> (flow). The name for the mineral later evolved to fluorspar (still commonly used) and then to fluorite.</p>\n<p>Hydrofluoric acid was known as a glass-etching agent from the 1720s, perhaps as early as 1670. Andreas Sigismund Marggraf made the first scientific report on its preparation in 1764 when he heated fluorite with sulfuric acid in glass, which was greatly corroded by the product. Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele repeated this reaction in 1771, recognizing the product as an acid, which he called \"fluss-spats-syran\" (fluor-spar-acid); in English, it was known as \"fluoric acid\".</p>\n<p>In 1810, French physicist André-Marie Ampère suggested that the acid was a compound of hydrogen with an unknown element, analogous to chlorine. Fluorite was then shown to be mostly composed of calcium fluoride. Sir Humphry Davy originally suggested the name <i>fluorine</i>, taking the root from the name of \"fluoric acid\" and the -ine suffix, similarly to other halogens. This name, with modifications, came to most European languages, although Greek, Russian, and some others (following Ampère's suggestion) use the name <i>ftor</i> or derivatives, from the Greek φθόριος (<i>phthorios</i>), meaning \"destructive\".) The New Latin name (<i>fluorum</i>) gave the element its current symbol, F, although the symbol Fl was used in early papers.</p>\n<h3>Isolation of the element</h3>\n<p>Progress in isolating the element was slowed by the exceptional dangers of generating fluorine: several 19th century experimenters, the \"fluorine martyrs\", were killed or blinded. Initial attempts to isolate the element were also hindered by material difficulties: the extreme corrosiveness and reactivity of hydrogen fluoride (and of fluorine gas) as well as problems getting a suitable conducting liquid for electrolysis.</p>\n<p>Edmond Frémy thought that passing electric current through pure hydrofluoric acid (dry HF) might work. Previously, hydrogen fluoride was only available in a water solution. Frémy therefore devised a method for producing dry hydrogen fluoride by acidifying potassium bifluoride (KHF). Unfortunately, pure hydrogen fluoride did not pass an electric current.</p>\n<p>French chemist Henri Moissan, formerly one of Frémy's students, continued the search. After trying many different approaches, he combined potassium bifluoride and dry hydrogen fluoride. The resultant solution conducted electricity. Moissan also constructed especially corrosion-resistant equipment: containers crafted from a mixture of platinum and iridium (more chemically resistant than pure platinum) with fluorite stoppers.</p>\n<p>After 74 years of effort by many chemists, on 26 June 1886, Moissan isolated elemental fluorine. In 1906, two months before his death, Moissan received the Nobel Prize in chemistry. The citation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...in recognition of the great services rendered by him in his investigation and isolation of the element fluorine...The whole world has admired the great experimental skill with which you have studied that savage beast among the elements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Later developments</h3>\n<p>During the 1930s and 1940s, the DuPont company commercialized organofluorine compounds at large scales. Following trials of chlorofluorcarbons as refrigerants by researchers at General Motors, DuPont developed large-scale production of Freon-12. Freon proved to be a marketplace hit, rapidly replacing earlier, more toxic, refrigerants and growing the overall market for kitchen refrigerators. In 1938, polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) was discovered by accident by a recently-hired DuPont PhD, Roy J. Plunkett. While working with a cylinder of tetrafluoroethylene, he was unable to release the gas although the weight had not changed. Scraping down the container, he found white flakes of a polymer new to the world. Tests showed the substance was resistant to corrosion from most substances and had better high temperature stability than any other plastic. In 1941, a crash program was making significant quantities of Teflon.</p>\n<p>Large-scale productions of elemental fluorine began during World War II. Germany used high-temperature electrolysis to produce tons of chlorine trifluoride, a compound planned to be used as an incendiary. The Manhattan project in the United States produced even more fluorine for use in uranium separation. Gaseous uranium hexafluoride was used to separate uranium-235, an important nuclear explosive, from the heavier uranium-238. Because uranium hexafluoride releases small quantities of corrosive fluorine, the separation plants were built with special materials. All pipes were coated with nickel; joints and flexible parts were fabricated from Teflon.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, concerns developed over the role chlorofluorocarbons play in damaging the ozone layer. By 1996, almost all nations had banned chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants and commercial production ceased. Fluorine continued to play a role in refrigeration though: hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were commercialized as replacement refrigerants.<br></p>\n<h2>Industry and applications</h2>\n<div>Main article: Fluorochemical industry</div>\n<p>An estimate pegged the fluorochemicals global market size at over $15 billion in 2011 and predicted 5% growth to 2018, when the market would exceed $20 billion. A different report said that, in 2016, global fluorochemicals production would be almost $20 billion on 3.5 million metric tons per year volume.</p>\n<p>The main source of fluorine, fluorite mining, was estimated in 2003 to be a $550 million industry, extracting 4.5&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons per year. Mined fluorite is concentrated by flotation separation into two main grades, with about equal production of each. Metspar (60–85% purity) is used almost exclusively for iron smelting. Acidspar (97%+ purity) is primarily converted to hydrofluoric acid (by reaction with sulfuric acid). The resultant HF is mostly used to produce organofluorides and synthetic cryolite.</p>\n<center>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><map name=\"ImageMap_1_847422035\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Fluorite\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"10,6,87,37\" alt=\"Fluorite\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Fluorapatite\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"10,186,87,215\" alt=\"Fluorapatite\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Hydrogen_fluoride\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"153,5,264,37\" alt=\"Hydrogen fluoride\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Smelting\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"153,70,265,105\" alt=\"Metal smelting\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Glass_production\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"153,131,264,166\" alt=\"Glass production\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Organofluorine\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"334,5,444,36\" alt=\"Fluorocarbons\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Sodium_hexafluoroaluminate\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"335,68,446,99\" alt=\"Sodium hexafluoroaluminate\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Pickling_(metal)\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"336,131,447,166\" alt=\"Pickling (metal)\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Hexafluorosilicic_acid\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"335,185,445,216\" alt=\"Fluorosilicic acid\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Cracking_(chemistry)\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"334,228,445,262\" alt=\"Alkane cracking\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Hydrofluorocarbon\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"522,6,632,37\" alt=\"Hydrofluorocarbon\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon#Development_of_alternatives_for_CFCs\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"523,51,632,82\" alt=\"Hydrochlorofluorocarbons\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"522,95,633,125\" alt=\"Chlorofluorocarbon\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"522,138,632,173\" alt=\"Teflon\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Water_fluoridation\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"523,184,633,216\" alt=\"Water fluoridation\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Enriched_uranium\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"522,227,633,257\" alt=\"Uranium enrichment\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"523,279,633,310\" alt=\"Sulfur hexafluoride\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Tungsten_hexafluoride\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"523,321,632,386\" alt=\"Tungsten hexafluoride\">\n<area href=\"/wiki/Phosphogypsum\" shape=\"rect\" coords=\"30,266,191,316\" alt=\"Phosphogypsum\"></map></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFluorine industry supply chain: Percentages indicate approximate mass flows of the element. Click for links to related articles.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</center>\n<h3>Inorganic fluorides</h3>\n<p>About 3&nbsp;kg (6.5&nbsp;lb) of metspar grade fluorite are added to make each metric ton of steel. The fluoride ions from CaF lower the melt's temperature and viscosity, making it runnier. Metspar is similarly used to produce cast iron and for other iron alloys.</p>\n<p>Acidspar grade fluorite is added to ceramics, enamels, glass fibers, clouded glass, cement, and the outer coating of welding rods. Most acidspar is used to make hydrofluoric acid, a chemical intermediate for most fluorine-containing compounds. Significant direct uses of HF include pickling (cleaning) steel, etching glass, and cracking alkanes in the petrochemical industry.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAluminium smelting process: cryolite (a fluoride) is required to dissolve alumnium oxide.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>One third of HF (one sixth of mined fluorine) is used to make synthetic cryolite (sodium hexafluoroaluminate) and aluminium trifluoride. These compounds are used in the electrolysis of aluminium by the Hall–Héroult process. About 23&nbsp;kg (51&nbsp;lb) are required for every metric ton of aluminium. Although small amounts are lost over time through various side reaction, the fluorides are not reactants in the smelting process, but fluxes that lower the temperature of the melt.</p>\n<p>Fluorosilicates are the next most significant inorganic fluorides formed from HF. Sodium fluorosilicate is used for water fluoridation, as an intermediate for synthetic cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride, and for treatment of effluents in laundries.</p>\n<p>Other inorganic fluorides made in large quantities include cobalt difluoride (for organofluorine synthesis), nickel difluoride (electronics), lithium fluoride (a flux), sodium fluoride (water fluoridation), potassium fluoride (flux), ammonium fluoride (various uses), and magnesium fluoride (antireflection optical coatings). Sodium and potassium bifluorides are significant to the chemical industry.</p>\n<h3>Fluorocarbons</h3>\n<p>Making organic fluorides is the main use for hydrofluoric acid, consuming over 40% of it (over 20% of all mined fluorite). Within organofluorides, refrigerant gases are still the dominant segment, consuming about 80% of HF. Fluoropolymers are less than one quarter the size of refrigerant gases in terms of fluorine usage but are growing faster. Fluorosurfactants (materials like Scotchgard, used in durable water repellents) are a small segment in mass but are significant economically—over $1 billion yearly revenue.</p>\n<h4>Refrigerant gases</h4>\n<div>See also: Refrigerant</div>\n<p>Traditionally chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were the predominant class of fluorinated organic chemical. CFCs are identified by a system of numbering (the R-number system) that explains the amount of fluorine, chlorine, carbon and hydrogen in the molecules. The DuPont brand Freon has been colloquially used for CFCs and similar halogenated molecules; brand-neutral terminology uses \"R\" (\"refrigerant\") as the prefix. Prominent CFCs included R-11 (trichlorofluoromethane), R-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), and R-114 (1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane).</p>\n<p>Production of CFCs grew strongly through the 1980s, primarily for refrigeration and air conditioning but also for propellants and solvents. Since the end use of these materials is now banned in most countries, this industry has shrunk dramatically. By the early 21st century, production of CFCs was less than 10% of the mid-1980s peak.</p>\n<p>Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) now serve as replacements for CFC refrigerants; few were commercially manufactured before 1990. Currently more than 90% of fluorine used for organics goes into these two classes, in about equal amounts. Prominent HCFCs include R-22 (chlorodifluoromethane) and R-141b (1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane). The main HFC is R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).</p>\n<h4>Fluoropolymers</h4>\n<div>Main article: Fluoropolymer</div>\n<p>The 2011 global fluoropolymer market was estimated at slightly under $6 billion revenue and predicted to grow 6.5% per year until 2016. As of about 2006–2007, fluoropolymer volume was estimated at over 180,000&nbsp;metric&nbsp;tons per year. The corresponding revenue estimate was over $3.5 billion.</p>\n<p>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is 60–80% of the world's fluoropolymer production on a weight basis. The DuPont brand Teflon is sometimes used generically for the substance. The largest application for PTFE is in electrical insulation. It is an excellent dielectric. It is also used extensively in the chemical process industry where corrosion resistance is needed: in coating pipes, in tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is architectural fabric (PTFE-coated fiberglass cloth used for stadium roofs and such). The major consumer application is non-stick cookware.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n<p>When stretched with a jerk, a PTFE film makes a fine-pored membrane: expanded PTFE (ePTFE). The term \"Gore-tex\" is sometimes used generically for this material, but that is a specific brand name. ePTFE is used in rainwear, protective apparel, and liquids and gas filters. PTFE can also be formed into fibers which are used in pump packing seals and bag house filters for industries with corrosive exhausts.</p>\n<p>Other fluoropolymers tend to have similar properties to PTFE—high chemical resistance and good dielectric properties—which leads to use in the chemical process industry and electrical insulation. They are easier to work with (to form into complex shapes), but are more expensive than PTFE and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers serve as glass-replacements in solar cells. Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) is the second most produced fluoropolymer.</p>\n<p>Fluorinated ionomers (polymers that include charged fragments) are expensive, chemically resistant materials used as membranes in electrochemical cells. Nafion, developed in the 1960s, was the first example and remains the most prominent material in the class. The initial application was as a fuel cell material in spacecraft. Since then, the material has been transforming the 55&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons per year chloralkali industry; it is replacing hazardous mercury-based cells with membrane cells. Recently, the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to get proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells into automobiles.</p>\n<p>Fluoroelastomers are rubber-like substances that are composed of crosslinked mixtures of fluoropolymers. Viton is a prominent example. Chemical-resistant O-rings are the primary application.</p>\n<h3>Fluorine gas</h3>\n<p>For countries with available data, about 17,000&nbsp;metric&nbsp;tons of fluorine are produced per year. Fluorine is relatively inexpensive, costing about $5–8 per kilogram ($2–4 per pound) when sold as uranium hexafluoride or sulfur hexafluoride. Because of difficulties in storage and handling, the price of fluorine gas is much higher. Processes demanding large amounts of fluorine gas generally vertically integrate and produce the gas onsite.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSF transformers at a Russian railway</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The largest application for elemental fluorine (up to 7,000&nbsp;metric&nbsp;tons per year) is the preparation of uranium hexafluoride, which is used in the production of nuclear fuels. To obtain the compound, uranium dioxide is first treated with hydrofluoric acid, to produce uranium tetrafluoride. This compound is then further fluorinated by direct exposure to fluorine gas to make the hexafluoride. Fluorine's monoisotopic natural occurrence makes it useful in uranium enrichment because uranium hexafluoride molecules will differ in mass only because of mass differences between uranium-235 and uranium-238. These mass differences are used to concentrate uranium-235 by diffusion or centrifugation.</p>\n<p>The second largest application for fluorine gas (about 6,000&nbsp;metric&nbsp;tons per year) is in sulfur hexafluoride, which is used as a dielectric medium in high voltage transformers and circuit breakers. SF gas has a much higher dielectric strength than air and is extremely chemically inert. Switchgear using SF has no hazardous polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in contrast to traditional oil-filled devices.</p>\n<p>Several compounds made from elemental fluorine serve the electronics industry. Rhenium and tungsten hexafluorides are used for chemical vapor deposition of thin metal films onto semiconductors. Tetrafluoromethane is used for plasma etching in semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing. Nitrogen trifluoride is used for cleaning equipment at display manufacturing plants.</p>\n<p>Some organic fluorides are prepared from elemental fluorine rather than from HF. However, because direct fluorination is usually too hard to control, intermediate strength fluorinators are made from fluorine gas. The halogen fluorides ClF, BrF, and IF provide gentler fluorination, with a series of strengths, and are easier to handle. Sulfur tetrafluoride is used for making fluorinated pharmaceuticals.</p>\n<h2>Production of fluorine gas</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nIndustrial fluorine cells at F2 Chemicals, Preston, England.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Electrolytic synthesis</h3>\n<p>Today, elemental fluorine is produced using Moissan's process of electrolyzing potassium fluoride/hydrogen fluoride mixtures, but with an apparatus made of different materials: the steel container acts as the cathode, attracting H ions and releasing hydrogen gas; a carbon block (similar to that used in aluminum production) acts as the anode, attracting F ions and releasing fluorine gas. The voltage is 8–12&nbsp;volts.</p>\n<p>When combined, potassium fluoride and hydrogen fluoride spontaneously produce potassium bifluoride (KHF), which increases the conductivity of the solution. A mixture with the approximate composition KF•2HF melts at 70&nbsp;°C (158&nbsp;°F) and is electrolyzed at 70–130&nbsp;°C (160–265&nbsp;°F). Because HF alone cannot be electrolyzed, the presence of some KF is critical, even though it is not consumed in the cell and remains in solution.</p>\n<h3>Chemical routes</h3>\n<p>In 1986, when preparing for a conference to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the discovery of fluorine, Karl Christe discovered a purely chemical preparation of fluorine gas. However, he stated in his work that the basics were known 50 years before the actual reaction. The main idea is that some metal fluoride anions do not have a neutral counterpart (or those are very unstable) and their acidifying would result in chemical oxidation, rather than formation of the expected molecules. Christe lists the following reactions as a possible way:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2&nbsp;KMnO + 2&nbsp;KF + 10&nbsp;HF + 3&nbsp;HO → 2&nbsp;KMnF + 8&nbsp;HO + 3&nbsp;O↑</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>2&nbsp;KMnF + 4&nbsp;SbF → 4&nbsp;KSbF + 2&nbsp;MnF + F↑</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Handling</h3>\n<p>Pure fluorine gas may be stored in steel cylinders, where the inside surface is passivated, as long as the temperature is kept below 200&nbsp;°C (400&nbsp;°F). Above that temperature, nickel is required. Regulator valves are made of nickel. Fluorine piping is generally made of nickel or Monel (nickel-copper alloy). Care must be taken to passivate all surfaces frequently and to exclude any water or greases. In the laboratory, fluorine gas may be used in glass tubing provided the pressure is low and moisture is excluded, but some sources recommend systems made of nickel, Monel, and PTFE.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLaboratory setup for fluorine reactions, University of Freiburg. The stainless steel enclosure on the left surrounds a small cylinder of fluorine. The line's piping, fittings and valves are Monel. The rig is in a fume hood; many controls are external, allowing reactions with the door closed.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Biological aspects</h2>\n<div>Main article: Biological aspects of fluorine</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSouth Africa's gifblaar is one of the few organisms that makes fluorine compounds.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Fluoride is not considered an essential mineral element for mammals or humans. Small amounts of fluoride may be beneficial for bone strength, but fluoride deficiency is an issue only in the formulation of artificial diets.</p>\n<p>Biologically synthesized organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants, but not in animals. The most common example is fluoroacetate, with an active poison molecule identical to commercial \"1080\". It is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 green plants in Australia, Brazil, and Africa. Other biologically synthesized organofluorines include ω-fluoro fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate.</p>\n<p>The enzyme adenosyl-fluoride synthase, which makes the carbon–fluorine bond, was isolated in bacteria in 2002. The discovery was touted as possibly leading to biological routes for organofluorine synthesis.</p>\n<h3>Dental care</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Fluoride therapy and Water fluoridation</div>\n<p>Since the mid-20th century, it has been understood (from population studies) that fluoride reduces tooth decay, somehow. Initially, researchers hypothesized that fluoride helped by converting tooth enamel from the mineral hydroxyapatite to the more acid-resistant mineral fluorapatite. However, recent studies showed no difference in the frequency of caries (cavities) amongst teeth that were pre-fluoridated to different degrees. Current thinking is that fluoride prevent cavities primarily by helping teeth that are in the very early stages of tooth decay to regrow tooth enamel. In any case, it is only the fluoride that is directly present in the mouth (topical treatment) that prevents cavities. Fluoride ions that are swallowed do not benefit the teeth.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTopical fluoride treatment in Panama</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply to reduce tooth decay. Its use began in the 1940s, following studies of children in a region where water was naturally fluoridated. It is now used for about two thirds of the U.S. population on public water systems and for about 6% of people worldwide. Although the best available evidence shows no association with adverse effects other than dental fluorosis, most of which is mild, water fluoridation has been contentious for ethical, safety, and efficacy reasons. Opposition to water fluoridation exists despite its support by public health organizations. The benefits of water fluoridation have lessened recently—presumably because of the availability of fluoride in other forms—but are still measurable, particularly for low income groups. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 showed significant reduction of cavities in children associated with water fluoridatation.</p>\n<p>Toothpaste may contain fluorine in the form of sodium fluoride, tin difluoride, or (most commonly) sodium monofluorophosphate. The first fluoride toothpaste was introduced in 1955 in the United States. Now, almost all toothpaste in developed countries is fluoridated. Fluoride may also be applied to teeth in gels, foams, or varnishes. It is also contained in prescription and non-prescription mouthwashes.<br></p>\n<h3>Pharmaceuticals</h3>\n<p>About 20% of modern pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including commercially significant drugs in many different pharmaceutical classes. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), was the number one money-making drug for nearly a decade. The branded asthma medication Serevent (Advair), a top-ten revenue drug as of the mid-2000s, also contains a fluorinated molecule: fluticasone.</p>\n<p>Even a single atom of fluorine, added to a drug molecule, can greatly change its chemical properties and thus how it interacts with the body. For instance, because of the considerable stability of the carbon-fluorine bond, many drugs are fluorinated to delay their metabolism and elimination by the body. This allows longer times between doses. Also, adding fluorine to organics increases their lipophilicity (ability to dissolve in fats) because the carbon–fluorine bond is even more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond. This effect often increases a drug's bioavailability because of increased cell membrane penetration.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nProzac (fluoxetine) capsules</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Many modern antidepressants are fluorinated molecules that selectively limit the body's binding of serotonin (low serotonin availability in brain cells is a cause of depression). Prior to the 1980s, traditional antidepressants, such as the tricyclics, altered not only serotonin uptake but also affected several other neurotransmitters. This non-selective interaction caused many side effects. One of the first drugs to alter only serotonin uptake—and be free of most side effects of previous drugs—was fluorine-containing Prozac (fluoxetine). It became the best-selling antidepressant and prompted the popular book <i>Listening to Prozac</i>. Some other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants that are fluorinated are Celexa (and its isomer Lexapro), Luvox, and Paxil.</p>\n<p>Quinolones are artificial compounds that are broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Most of the recent quinolone drugs (and those in current common use) are fluorinated to make the drugs more powerful. Prominent examples of such fluoroquinolones include ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and levofloxacin (Levaquin). The latter was the highest selling U.S. antibiotic in 2010.</p>\n<p>Fluorine also finds use in many steroidal drugs. Fludrocortisone (Florinef) is a synthetic mineralocorticoid (a compound used to retain sodium and water and thus raise blood pressure). Dexamethasone (Decadron) and triamcinolone (Kenalog) are potent synthetic glucocorticoids (anti-inflammatories).</p>\n<p>Several inhaled anesthetics, including the most common ones, are heavily fluorinated. The first fluorinated anesthetic, halothane, proved to be much safer (neither explosive nor flammable) and longer-lasting than those previously used. Modern fluorinated anesthetics are longer-lasting still and almost insoluble in blood, which accelerates the awakening. Examples include sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane, and isoflurane, all fluorinated ethers.</p>\n<h3>Agrichemicals and poisons</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSign warning of poisonous sodium fluoroacetate baits</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>An estimated 30% of agrichemical compounds contain fluorine. Most of them are poisons, but a few stimulate growth instead.</p>\n<p>Sodium monofluoroacetate, the same acid as in vinegar but with one hydrogen changed out for fluorine, is a powerful poison. It was first synthesized in the late 19th century and was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th century. Later, it became widely used to control mammalian pests (e.g. rats). The name \"1080\" refers to the catalogue number of the poison, which became its brand name. The compound is now banned in the European community and the United States but is still used in Australia and some other countries. Fluoroacetate deprives cells of energy by replacing acetate in the Krebs cycle, halting a key part of cell metabolism. Several insecticides contain sodium fluoride, which is much less toxic than fluoroacetate.</p>\n<p>Trifluralin was once a very important weedkiller; for example, in 1998 over a half of U.S. cotton field area was coated with the chemical. However, its suspected carcinogenic properties caused some Northern European countries to ban it in 1993. Although currently banned throughout the whole European Union, this decision has recently been contested.</p>\n<p>The currently used agrichemicals utilize another tactic: instead of directly poisoning organisms by interfering with metabolism, they transform the metabolic processes so that the organism itself produces poisonous compounds. For example, insects fed 29-fluorostigmasterol (a fluorinated steroid) produce fluoroacetates. Because vertebrates do not break down the fluorosteroid, the insecticide is more safe than 1080. If a fluorine is transferred to a body cell, it blocks metabolism at the position occupied.</p>\n<p>Use of fluorine agrichemicals may increase if the cost of synthesis decreases and if green chemistry accentuates the differences between these agrichemicals and other less-environmentally-friendly alternatives.<br></p>\n<h3>Scanning</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWhole-body PET scan using fluorine-18</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main articles: Positron emission tomography and Fludeoxyglucose (18F)</div>\n<p>Compounds containing fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that emits positrons, are often used in positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, because the isotope's half-life of about 110 minutes is long by positron-emitter standards. One such radiopharmaceutical is 2-deoxy-2-(F)fluoro-D-glucose (generically referred to as fludeoxyglucose), commonly abbreviated as F-FDG, or simply FDG. In PET imaging, FDG can be used for assessing glucose metabolism in the brain and for imaging cancer tumors. After injection into the blood, FDG is taken up by \"FDG-avid\" tissues with a high need for glucose, such as the brain and most types of malignant tumors. Tomography, often assisted by a computer to form a PET/CT (CT stands for \"computer tomography\") machine, can then be used to diagnose or monitor treatment of cancers; especially Hodgkin's lymphoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Natural fluorine is monoisotopic, consisting solely of fluorine-19. Fluorine compounds are highly amenable to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), because fluorine-19 has a nuclear spin of ½, a high nuclear magnetic moment, and a high magnetogyric ratio. Fluorine compounds typically have a fast NMR relaxation, which enables the use of fast averaging to obtain a signal-to-noise ratio similar to hydrogen-1 NMR spectra. Fluorine-19 is commonly used in NMR study of metabolism, protein structures and conformational changes. In addition, inert fluorinated gases have the potential to be a cheap and efficient tool for imaging lung ventilation.<br></p>\n<h2>Hazards</h2>\n<h3>Fluorine gas</h3>\n<p>Elemental fluorine is highly toxic. Above a concentration of 25&nbsp;ppm, fluorine causes significant irritation while attacking the eyes, respiratory tract, lungs, liver and kidneys. At a concentration of 100&nbsp;ppm, human eyes and noses are seriously damaged.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nU.S. hazard signs for commercially transported fluorine</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Hydrofluoric acid</h3>\n<div>See also: Chemical burn</div>\n<p>Hydrogen fluoride is a toxic gas. Its water solution, hydrofluoric acid, is a contact poison and must be handled with extreme care, far beyond that accorded to other mineral acids. From 1984-1994, at least 9 U.S. workers died from accidents with HF.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHF burns</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Owing to its lesser chemical dissociation in water (remaining a neutral molecule), hydrogen fluoride penetrates tissue more quickly than typical acids. Poisoning can occur readily through the skin or eyes or when inhaled or swallowed. Once in the blood, hydrogen fluoride reacts with calcium and magnesium, resulting in electrolyte imbalance (potentially hypocalcemia). The consequent cardiac arrhythmia may be fatal. Formation of insoluble calcium fluoride also causes strong pain. Burns with areas larger than 160&nbsp;cm (25&nbsp;in), about the size of a man's hand, can cause serious systemic toxicity.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid may not be immediately evident, with 8-hour delay for 50% HF and up to 24-hour for lower concentrations. Hydrogen fluoride interferes with nerve function, meaning that burns may not initially be painful. Accidental exposures can go unnoticed, delaying treatment and increasing injury.</p>\n<p>If the burn has been initially noticed, then HF should be washed off with a forceful stream of water for ten to fifteen minutes, to prevent its further penetration into the body. Clothing used by the person burned may also exhibit danger. Hydrofluoric acid exposure is often treated with calcium gluconate, a source of Ca that binds with the fluoride ions. Skin burns can be treated with a water wash and 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions.</p>\n<p>Because HF is absorbed, medical treatment is necessary. Calcium gluconate may be injected or administered by IV. Use of calcium chloride is contra-indicated and may lead to severe complications. Sometimes surgical excision of tissue or amputation may be required.</p>\n<h3>Fluoride ion</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGeographical areas with groundwater having over 1.5&nbsp;mg/L of naturally occurring fluoride, which is above recommended levels.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Fluoride poisoning</div>\n<p>Soluble fluorides are moderately toxic. For sodium fluoride, the lethal dose for adults is 5–10&nbsp;g, which is equivalent to 32–64&nbsp;mg of elemental fluoride per kilogram of body weight. The dose that may lead to adverse health effects is about one fifth the lethal dose. Chronic excess fluoride consumption can lead to skeletal fluorosis, a disease of the bones that affects millions in Asia and Africa.</p>\n<p>The fluoride ion is readily absorbed by the stomach and intestines. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach. In this form, fluoride crosses cell membranes and then binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes.</p>\n<p>Fluoride is excreted through urine. Fluoride exposure limits are based on urine testing which has determined the human body's capacity for ridding itself of fluoride.</p>\n<p>Historically, most cases of fluoride poisoning have been caused by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluoride, Currently, most calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunction of water fluoridation equipment has occurred several times, including an Alaskan incident which sickened nearly 300 people and killed one.</p>\n<h2>Environmental concerns</h2>\n<h3>Atmosphere</h3>\n<div>See also: Ozone depletion&nbsp;and global warming</div>\n<p>Because they deplete the ozone layer, Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons (BFCs) have been strictly regulated via a series of international agreements called the Montreal Protocol. It is the chlorine and bromine from these molecules that cause harm, not fluorine. Because of the inherent stability of these fully halogenated molecules (which makes them so nonflammable and useful), they are able to reach the upper reaches of the atmosphere before decomposing. At those altitudes, they release chlorine and bromine which then attack the ozone molecules. Predictions are that generations will be required, even after the CFC ban, for these molecules to leave the atmosphere and for the ozone layer to recover. Early indications are that the CFC ban is working—ozone depletion has stopped and recovery is underway.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNASA projection of stratospheric ozone over North America if CFCs had not been banned</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are current replacements for CFCs, with about one tenth the ozone damaging potential (ODP). They were originally scheduled for elimination by 2030 in developed nations (2040 in undeveloped). In 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prohibited production of one HCFC and capped the production of the two others. In 2007, a new treaty was signed by almost all nations to move HCFC phaseout up to 2020 because HFCs, which have no chlorine and thus zero ODP, are available.</p>\n<p>Fluorocarbon gases of all sorts (CFCs, HFCs, etc.) are greenhouse gases about 4,000 to 10,000&nbsp;times as potent as carbon dioxide. Sulfur hexafluoride exhibits an even stronger effect, about 20,000 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide.</p>\n<h3>Biopersistance</h3>\n<p>Because of the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond, organofluorines endure in the environment. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), used in waterproofing sprays, are persistent global contaminants. Trace quantities of these substances have been detected worldwide, from polar bears in the Arctic to the global human population. PFOA has been detected in breast milk and the blood of newborns. One study indicates that PFOS levels in wildlife are starting to go down because of reducing production.</p>\n<p>In the body, PFOA binds to a protein, serum albumin. PFOA's tissue distribution in humans is unknown, but studies in rats suggest it is likely to be present primarily in the liver, kidney, and blood. PFOA is not metabolized by the body, but is excreted by the kidneys.</p>\n<p>The potential health effects of PFOA are unclear. Unlike chlorinated hydrocarbons, PFOA is not lipophilic (stored in fat), nor is it genotoxic (damaging genes). While both PFOA and PFOS cause cancer in high quantities in animals, studies on exposed humans have not been able to prove an impact at current exposures. Bottlenose dolphins have some of the highest PFOS concentrations of any wildlife studied; one study suggests an impact on their immune systems.</p>\n<p>Because biological systems do not metabolize fluorinated molecules easily, fluorinated pharmaceuticals (often antibiotics and antidepressants) are among the major fluorinated organics found in treated city sewage and wastewater. Fluorine-containing agrichemicals are measurable in farmland runoff and nearby rivers.<br></p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>Main article: Compounds of fluorine</div>\n<p>Fluorine's common oxidation state is −1. With other atoms, fluorine forms either ionic bonds or polar covalent bonds. Covalent bonds involving fluorine atoms are almost always single bonds. Fluoride may act as a bridging ligand between two metals in some complex molecules. Molecules containing fluorine may also exhibit hydrogen bonding. Fluorine has a rich chemistry including compounds formed with hydrogen, metals, main group nonmetals, and even noble gases, as well as a diverse set of organic compounds.</p>\n<h3>Hydrogen fluoride</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Hydrogen fluoride and Hydrofluoric acid</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBoiling points of the hydrogen halides (blue) and hydrogen chalcogenides (red): HF and HO break trends.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Fluorine combines with hydrogen to make a compound called hydrogen fluoride (HF) or, in the context of water solutions, hydrofluoric acid. HF molecules cluster together weakly via hydrogen bonds. Because of this, hydrogen fluoride behaves more like water than like HCl. Hydrogen fluoride boils at a much higher temperature than the heavier hydrogen halides. HF is also fully miscible with water (dissolves in any proportion), unlike HCl, HBr, or HI.</p>\n<p>In water solution, hydrogen fluoride is a weak acid, having lower dissociation constant compared to the other hydrohalic acids. Hydrofluoric acid is non-ideal: instead of having a constant acid dissociation constant (PKa), HF's inherent acidity increases at higher concentrations through a phenomenon called homoconjugation. Although hydrofluoric acid is weak, it is very corrosive, even attacking glass.</p>\n<h3>Metal fluorides</h3>\n<div>See also: Fluoride volatility</div>\n<p>Metal fluorides share some similarities with other metal halides but are more ionic, often more like oxides in their bonding and crystal structures. However, there is a trend of the binary metal fluorides becoming more covalently-bonded and volatile as the amount of fluorination increases. For example, sodium monofluoride boils at 1704&nbsp;°C (3099&nbsp;°F), while rhenium heptafluoride has a boiling point below water's. Similar to fluorine itself, the higher metal fluorides are very reactive. Platinum hexafluoride was the first compound to oxidize molecular oxygen and xenon. The solubility of fluorides varies greatly but tends to decrease with more fluorine.</p>\n<p>The alkali metals form monofluorides that, like the alkali metal chlorides, are very ionic and soluble. They have the same atomic arrangement—the rock salt crystal structure—as sodium chloride. Other metal monofluorides show clear difference versus their chlorides. For example, thallium and silver monofluorides are soluble, while the chlorides are not.</p>\n<p>The difluorides of the alkaline earths are also very ionic, but are generally very insoluble. In contrast, the alkali earth dichlorides are fairly soluble. Beryllium difluoride differs from those of the other alkaline earths: the bonding has some covalent character, the structures are similar to SiO (quartz), and the compound is water soluble.</p>\n<p>Many metals form trifluorides, such as iron, bismuth, the rare earths, some actinides, and the metals in the aluminium and scandium columns of the periodic table. Gold forms a trifluoride that has a polymer structure, with helical chains. In contrast, gold trichloride is molecular.</p>\n<p>The tetrafluorides show a mixture of ionic and covalent bonding. Zirconium and hafnium, along with several actinides, form tetrafluorides with an ionic structure based on 8-coordinate metal cations. Melting points are around 1000&nbsp;°C (1850&nbsp;°F). On the other hand, the tetrafluorides of titanium,, vanadium, niobium are polymeric. The first melts at 284&nbsp;°C (543&nbsp;°F); the latter two decompose at around 350&nbsp;°C (650&nbsp;°F).</p>\n<p>The pentafluorides are even more covalently bonded, forming low dimensionality polymers or oligomeric molecules. Bismuth and uranium pentafluorides share the same structure: straight chains of connected octahedra. Gold's pentafluoride is a dimer (doubled molecule), AuF. Niobium and tantalum pentafluorides are tetrameric molecules (fourfold clusters). The former melts at 80&nbsp;°C (176&nbsp;°F), the latter at 95&nbsp;°C (203&nbsp;°F).</p>\n<p>There are thirteen metal hexafluorides. All are octahedral molecules. At room temperature tungsten hexafluoride is a gas. Molybdenum hexafluoride and rhenium hexafluoride are liquids. The rest are volatile solids.</p>\n<p>The only definite metal heptafluoride, rhenium heptafluoride, is a low-melting molecular solid. Its structure is pentagonal bipyramidal.</p>\n\n<h3>Nonmetal fluorides</h3>\n<p>The binary fluorides of the main group nonmetals and metalloids are generally volatile, covalently bonded molecules. The fluorides of those elements in the second row of the period table (carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen) follow the octet rule. Boron is an exception—its fluoride has an incomplete octet (less bonds than normal). Nonmetals from the third row of the period table and below form fluorides which are hypervalent (more bonds than normal). The discussion is organized by periodic table column.</p>\n<p>Boron trifluoride is a planar molecule. It is a weak Lewis acid and readily accepts a Lewis base, forming adducts (combinations). The lone pair of a Lewis base, such as ammonia, allows the boron to complete its octet. With another fluoride ion (F is a Lewis base), BF reacts to form the relatively unreactive BF anion.</p>\n<p>Silicon tetrafluoride and germanium tetrafluoride adopt a tetrahedral structure and are Lewis acids. Germanium forms a difluoride, less stable than its tetrafluoride.</p>\n<p>The pnictogens (nitrogen's column) form trifluorides that are weak Lewis bases and are more reactive as the pnictogen becomes heavier. In comparison, the pnictogen pentafluorides are much more reactive, with antimony pentafluoride being the strongest Lewis acid of all charge-neutral compounds. PF and AsF are trigonal bipramidal in all phases, as is gaseous SbF. Liquid and solid SbF have more complicated structures with octahedral antimony and bridging fluorines. Nitrogen is different than other pnictogens as it forms a trifluoride that is stable against hydrolysis and is not a Lewis base. Also, nitrogen pentafluoride does not exist.</p>\n<p>The chalcogens (oxygen's column) form a variety of fluorides. Unstable difluorides are known for oxygen (the only compound where oxygen is at oxidation state +2) as well as sulfur and selenium. Sulfur and selenium tetrafluorides are molecular while TeF is a polymer. The tetrafluorides are thermally unstable and hydrolyze. The hexafluorides are the result of direct fluorination of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium, while other hexahalides of the elements do not even exist. SF is extremely inert, while SeF and TeF show increasingly higher reactivity.</p>\n<p>The well-characterized heavier halogens (chlorine, bromine, and iodine) all form mono-, tri-, and pentafluorides: XF, XF, and XF. Of the neutral +7 species, only iodine heptafluoride is known. The corresponding cations ClF and BrF, are known and are extremely strong oxidizers. For the radioactive astatine only the non-volatile astatine monofluoride has been studied, but its existence is debated. Many of the halogen fluorides are powerful fluorinators (sources of fluorine atoms). ClF readily fluorinates asbestos and refractory oxides, and industrial use requires precautions similar to those for fluorine gas.</p>\n\n<h3>Noble gas compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: Noble gas compound</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nXenon tetrafluoride, 1962</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The noble gases are generally non-reactive because they have complete electronic shells. Until the 1960s, no chemical bond with a noble gas was known. In 1962, Neil Bartlett reported the first chemical compound of xenon, xenon hexafluoroplatinate. Later in 1962, xenon was reported to react directly with fluorine to form the di- and tetrafluorides. Since then, xenon hexafluoride, various oxyfluorides, and their derivatives have been prepared.</p>\n<p>Krypton, xenon's lighter homolog, also forms difluoride and a few more complicated fluorine-containing compounds. The possibility of a tetrafluoride or a hexafluoride has been debated.</p>\n<p>Radon, xenon's heavier homolog has been shown to readily react with fluorine to form a solid compound. It is generally thought to be radon difluoride, but the exact formula is not known. If radon were not so radioactive and difficult to collect, its chemistry might be at least as extensive as xenon's.</p>\n<p>The lightest noble gases do not form stable binary fluorides. Argon, however, reacts in extreme conditions with hydrogen fluoride to form argon fluorohydride. Helium and neon do not form any stable chemical compounds at all, but helium fluorohydride has been observed and it is unstable in gas phase, but it may be stable under enormous pressure. Neon is considered less reactive than helium and is not expected to form a stable compound capable of synthesis.</p>\n<h3>Organic compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organofluorine chemistry</div>\n<p>The carbon–fluorine chemical bond is the strongest bond in organic chemistry. This C–F bond strength, along with the low polarizability of molecules containing C-F, makes organofluorines very stable. Fluorinated organics have similar sizes to corresponding unfluorinated molecules because of the small van der Waals radius of fluorine.</p>\n<p>The range of organofluorine compounds is diverse, reflecting the inherent complexity of organic chemistry. A vast number of small molecules can exist with varying amounts of fluorine substitution, as well as many polymers. Research in particular areas is driven by the commercial value of applications.</p>\n<h4>Small molecules</h4>\n<p>Partially fluorinated alkanes are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Monofluoroalkanes (alkanes with one hydrogen replaced with fluorine) have properties similar to unfluorinated alkanes. They are soluble in many nonpolar solvents and have some chemical and thermal instability. As more fluorines are substituted for hydrogens, the properties change. Solubility in hydrocarbons decreases and stability increases. Also, melting and boiling points decrease, while density goes up.</p>\n<p>When all hydrogens are replaced with fluorines to make <i>perfluorocarbons</i> (the \"per\" means maximum), a great difference is revealed. Such compounds are extremely stable, and only sodium in liquid ammonia attacks them at standard conditions. They are also very insoluble, with few organic solvents capable of dissolving them.</p>\n\n<p>Perfluorinated compounds, hydrocarbons that are fully fluorinated except for one functional group have a combination of properties. (See \"Perfluorinated compound\".) They exhibit many perfluorocarbon properties (e.g. inertness, stability, non-wetting by water and oils, slipperiness). However, the functional group is available for reactions or may make the molecule behave as a surfactant. If a perfluorinated compound has a fluorinated tail but also a few non-fluorinated carbons (typically two) near the functional group, it is called a fluorotelomer. Industrially, such compounds are treated as perfluorinated.</p>\n<p>Fluorinating an organic acid raises its acidity. For example, acetic acid and its mono-, di-, and trifluoroacetic derivatives show a trend of lowering pK: 4.74, 2.66, 1.24, 0.23 (thus increasing acidity). This happens because of fluorine's inductive effect (it stabilizes anions by spreading negative charge, allowing the hydrogen to be released). Similarly, the acidity is greatly increased for other perfluorocarboxyl acids, as well as the amines (which are not acids but become less basic if fluorinated). The perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids are also very notable for their acidity. Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, is comparable to strong mineral acids.</p>\n<h4>Polymers</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe complex unit structure of Nafion</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As with small molecules, replacing hydrogen with fluorine in a polymer increases chemical stability and reduces flammability. Melting points are typically much higher than in the corresponding hydrocarbon polymers.</p>\n<p>The simplest fluoroplastic is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, DuPont brand Teflon), which is a simple linear chain polymer with the repeating structural unit: –CF–. It has no hydrogens and is the perfluoro analog of polyethylene (structural unit: –CH–). PTFE has high chemical and thermal stability, as expected for a perfluorocarbon, much stronger than polyethylene. However, its very high melting point makes it difficult to fashion into parts.</p>\n<p>Various PTFE derivatives have lower maximum usage temperatures but have the benefit of being more melt-processable. FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene is structurally similar to PTFE but has some fluorines replaced with the –CF groups). PFA (perfluoroalkoxy has some fluorines replaced with –OCF).</p>\n<p>There are other fluoroplastics that are not perfluorinated (contain some C-H). Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, structural unit: –CFCH–), is an analog of PTFE with half the fluorines. PVF (polyvinyl fluoride, structural unit: –CHCHF–) contains one one-fourth the fluorines of PTFE. Despite this, it still has many properties of more fluorinated compounds.</p>\n<p>Nafion is a structurally complicated polymer. It has a PTFE-like backbone, but also contains side chains of perfluoro ether that end in sulfonic acid (–SOOH) groups. Because of the polar side chains, it is very hydroscopic. With the addition of water and cations such as Na, Nafion can be made into an ionic conductor.</p>\n"

  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For the PlayStation Home game, see Sodium (PlayStation Home).  For the racehorse, see Sodium (horse).</div>\n<div>\"Natrium\" redirects here. For the town in West Virginia, see Natrium, West Virginia.</div>\n\n<p><b>Sodium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol&nbsp;<b>Na</b> (from Latin: natrium) and atomic number&nbsp;11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal and is a member of the alkali metals; its only stable isotope is Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but instead must be prepared from its compounds; it was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt. Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble, and their sodium has been leached by the action of water so that chloride and sodium are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the Earth's bodies of oceanic water.</p>\n<p>Many sodium compounds are useful, such as sodium hydroxide (lye) for soapmaking, and sodium chloride for use as a deicing agent and a nutrient (edible salt). Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants. In animals, sodium ions are used against potassium ions to build up charges on cell membranes, allowing transmission of nerve impulses when the charge is dissipated. The consequent need of animals for sodium causes it to be classified as a dietary inorganic macro-mineral.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<p>Sodium at standard temperature and pressure is a soft metal that can be readily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity. Freshly exposed, sodium has a bright, silvery luster that rapidly tarnishes, forming a white coating of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate. These properties change at elevated pressures: at 1.5&nbsp;Mbar, the color changes to black, then to red transparent at 1.9&nbsp;Mbar, and finally clear transparent at 3&nbsp;Mbar. All of these allotropes are insulators and electrides.</p>\n<p>When sodium or its compounds are introduced into a flame, they turn it yellow, because the excited 3s electrons of sodium emit a photon when they fall from 3p to 3s; the wavelength of this photon corresponds to the D line at 589.3&nbsp;nm. Spin-orbit interactions involving the electron in the 3p orbital split the D line into two; hyperfine structures involving both orbitals cause many more lines.</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEmission spectrum for sodium, showing the D line.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA positive flame test for sodium has a bright yellow color.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Sodium is generally less reactive than potassium and more reactive than lithium. Like all the alkali metals, it reacts exothermically with water, to the point that sufficiently large pieces melt to a sphere and may explode; this reaction produces caustic sodium hydroxide and flammable hydrogen gas. When burned in dry air, it mainly forms sodium peroxide as well as some sodium oxide. In moist air, sodium hydroxide results. Sodium metal is highly reducing, with the reduction of sodium ions requiring −2.71 volts but potassium and lithium have even more negative potentials. Hence, the extraction of sodium metal from its compounds (such as with sodium chloride) uses a significant amount of energy.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of sodium</div>\n<p>20 isotopes of sodium are known, but only Na is stable. Two radioactive, cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation: Na with a half-life of 2.6 years and Na with a half-life of 15 hours; all other isotopes have a half-life of less than one minute. Two nuclear isomers have been discovered, the longer-lived one being Na with a half-life of around 20.2 microseconds. Acute neutron radiation, such as from a nuclear criticality accident, converts some of the stable Na in human blood to Na; by measuring the concentration of Na in relation to Na, the neutron radiation dosage of the victim can be calculated.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<p>Na is created in the carbon-burning process by fusing two carbon atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star with at least three solar masses. The Earth's crust has 2.6% sodium by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element on Earth. Because of its high reactivity, it is never found as a pure element. It is found in many different minerals, some very soluble, such as halite and natron, others much less soluble such as amphibole, and zeolite. The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as cryolite and feldspar arises from their polymeric anions, which in the case of feldspar is a polysilicate. In the interstellar medium, sodium is identified by the D line; though it has a high vaporization temperature, its abundance allowed it to be detected by Mariner 10 in Mercury's atmosphere.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Sodium compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of sodium chloride, showing octahedral coordination around Na and Cl centres. This framework disintegrates upon dissolution in water and reassembles upon evaporation.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Sodium compounds are of immense commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The sodium compounds that are the most important include table salt (NaCl), soda ash (NaCO), baking soda (NaHCO), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate (NaSO·5HO), and borax (NaBO·10HO). In its compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions, and is viewed as a hard Lewis acid.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTwo equivalent images of the chemical structure of sodium stearate, a typical soap.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Most soaps are sodium salts of fatty acids. Sodium soaps are harder (higher melting) soaps than potassium soaps. Sodium chloride is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing and as a preservative; sodium bicarbonate is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; although in most cases potassium is the better ion, sodium is selected for its lower price and atomic weight.Sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.</p>\n<h3>Aqueous solutions</h3>\n<p>Sodium tends to form water-soluble compounds, such as halides, sulfates, nitrates, carboxylates and carbonates. The main aqueous species are the aquo complexes [Na(HO)], where n = 4–6. The high affinity of sodium for oxygen-based ligands is the basis of crown ethers; macrolide antibiotics, which interfere with Na transport in the infecting organism, are functionally related and more complex.</p>\n<p>Direct precipitation of sodium salts from aqueous solutions is rare, because sodium salts typically have a high affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO). Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35 g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, may be used as a phase-transfer catalyst.</p>\n<p>Sodium content in bulk may be determined by treating with a large excess of uranyl zinc acetate; the hexahydrate (UO)ZnNa(CHCO)·6HO precipitates, which can be weighed. Caesium and rubidium do not interfere with this reaction, but potassium and lithium do. Lower concentrations of sodium may be determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry or by potentiometry using ion-selective electrodes.</p>\n<h3>Electrides and sodides</h3>\n<p>Like the other alkali metals, sodium dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply coloured solutions; evaporation of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic sodium. The solutions contain the coordination complex (Na(NH)), whose positive charge is counterbalanced by electrons as anions; cryptands permit the isolation of these complexes as crystalline solids. Cryptands, like crown ethers and other ionophores, have a high affinity for the sodium ion; derivatives of the alkalide Na are obtainable by the addition of cryptands to solutions of sodium in ammonia via disproportionation.</p>\n<h3>Organosodium compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe structure of the complex of sodium (Na, shown in yellow) and the antibiotic monensin-A.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Many organosodium compounds have been prepared. Because of the high polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of carbanions (salts with organic anions). Some well known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide (NaCH) and trityl sodium ((CH)CNa).</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Salt has been an important commodity in human activities, as shown by the English word <i>salary</i>, which derives from <i>salarium</i>, the wafers of salt sometimes given to Roman soldiers along with their other wages. In medieval Europe, a compound of sodium with the Latin name of <i>sodanum</i> was used as a headache remedy. The name sodium is thought to originate from the Arabic <i>suda</i> (صداع), meaning headache, as the headache-alleviating properties of sodium carbonate or soda were well known in early times. The chemical abbreviation for sodium was first published by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in his system of atomic symbols, and is a contraction of the element's new Latin name <i>natrium</i>, which refers to the Egyptian <i>natron</i>, a natural mineral salt primarily made of hydrated sodium carbonate. Natron historically had several important industrial and household uses, later eclipsed by other sodium compounds. Although sodium, sometimes called <i>soda</i>, had long been recognised in compounds, the metal itself was not isolated until 1807 by Sir Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide.</p>\n<p>Sodium imparts an intense yellow color to flames. As early as 1860, Kirchhoff and Bunsen noted the high sensitivity of a sodium flame test, and stated in Annalen der Physik und Chemie:</p>\n\n<h2>Commercial production</h2>\n<p>Enjoying rather specialized applications, only about 100,000 tonnes of metallic sodium are produced annually. Metallic sodium was first produced commercially in 1855 by carbothermal reduction of sodium carbonate at 1100&nbsp;°C, in what is known as the Deville process:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>NaCO + 2 C → 2 Na + 3 CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>A related process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in 1886.</p>\n<p>Sodium is now produced commercially through the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, based on a process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs Cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700&nbsp;°C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process of electrolyzing sodium hydroxide.</p>\n<p>Reagent-grade sodium in tonne quantities sold for about US$3.30/kg in 2009; lower purity metal sells for considerably less. The market for sodium is volatile due to the difficulty in its storage and shipping; it must be stored under a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent the formation of a surface layer of sodium oxide or sodium superoxide. These oxides can react violently in the presence of organic materials. Smaller quantities of sodium cost far more, in the range of US$165/kg; the high cost is partially due to the expense of shipping hazardous material.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Though metallic sodium has some important uses, the major applications of sodium use it in its many compounds; millions of tons of the chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually.</p>\n<h3>Free element</h3>\n<p>Metallic sodium is mainly used for the production of sodium borohydride, sodium azide, indigo, and triphenylphosphine. Previous uses were for the making of tetraethyllead and titanium metal; because applications for these chemicals were discontinued, the production of sodium declined after 1970. Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an anti-scaling agent, and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective. Sodium vapor lamps are often used for street lighting in cities and give colours ranging from yellow-orange to peach as the pressure increases. By itself or with potassium, sodium is a desiccant; it gives an intense blue colouration with benzophenone when the desiccate is dry. In organic synthesis, sodium is used in various reactions such as the Birch reduction, and the sodium fusion test is conducted to qualitatively analyse compounds. Lasers emitting light at the D line, utilising sodium, are used to create artificial laser guide stars that assist in the adaptive optics for land-based visible light telescopes.</p>\n<h4>Heat transfer</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNaK phase diagram, showing the melting point of sodium as a function of potassium concentration. NaK with 77% potassium is eutectic and has the lowest melting point of the NaK alloys at −12.6 °C.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Liquid sodium is used as a heat transfer fluid in some fast reactors, due to its high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section, which is required to achieve a high neutron flux; the high boiling point allows the reactor to operate at ambient pressure. Drawbacks of using sodium include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its explosive properties. Radioactive sodium-24 may be formed by neutron activation during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard; the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be frequently shut down, NaK is used; due to it being liquid at room temperature, cooling pipes do not freeze. In this case, the pyrophoricity of potassium means extra precautions against leaks need to be taken. Another heat transfer application is in high-performance internal combustion engines with poppet valves, where valve stems partially filled with sodium are used as a heat pipe to cool the valves.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n\n<div>Main article: Sodium in biology</div>\n<p>In humans, sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods. The DRI for sodium is 2.3&nbsp;grams per day, but on average people in the United States consume 3.4&nbsp;grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.</p>\n<p>The renin-angiotensin system regulates the amount of fluids and sodium in the body. Reduction of blood pressure and sodium concentration in the kidney result in the production of renin, which in turn produces aldosterone and angiotensin, retaining sodium in the urine. Because of the increase in sodium concentration, the production of renin decreases, and the sodium concentration returns to normal. Sodium is also important in neuron function and osmoregulation between cells and the extracellular fluid, their distribution mediated in all animals by Na/K-ATPase; hence, sodium is the most prominent cation in extracellular fluid.</p>\n<p>In C4 plants, sodium is a micronutrient that aids in metabolism, specifically in regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate and synthesis of chlorophyll. In others, it substitutes for potassium in several roles, such as maintaining turgor pressure and aiding in the opening and closing of stomata. Excess sodium in the soil limits the uptake of water due to decreased water potential, which may result in wilting; similar concentrations in the cytoplasm can lead to enzyme inhibition, which in turn causes necrosis and chlorosis. To avoid these problems, plants developed mechanisms that limit sodium uptake by roots, store them in cell vacuoles, and control them over long distances; excess sodium may also be stored in old plant tissue, limiting the damage to new growth.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Care is required in handling elemental sodium, as it generates flammable hydrogen and caustic sodium hydroxide upon contact with water; powdered sodium may combust spontaneously in air or oxygen. Excess sodium can be safely removed by hydrolysis in a ventilated cabinet; this is typically done by sequential treatment with isopropanol, ethanol and water. Isopropanol reacts very slowly, generating the corresponding alkoxide and hydrogen. Fire extinguishers based on water accelerate sodium fires; those based on carbon dioxide and bromochlorodifluoromethane lose their effectiveness when they dissipate. An effective extinguishing agent is Met-L-X, which comprises approximately 5% Saran in sodium chloride together with flow agents; it is most commonly hand-applied with a scoop. Other materials include Lith+, which has graphite powder and an organophosphate flame retardant, and dry sand.</p>\n"

  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with manganese.</div>\n\n<p><b>Magnesium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol&nbsp;<b>Mg</b> and atomic number&nbsp;12. Its common oxidation number is +2. It is an alkaline earth metal and the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and ninth in the known universe as a whole. Magnesium is the fourth most common element in the Earth as a whole (behind iron, oxygen and silicon), making up 13% of the planet's mass and a large fraction of the planet's mantle. The relative abundance of magnesium is related to the fact that it easily builds up in supernova stars from a sequential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon (which in turn is made from three helium nuclei). Due to magnesium ion's high solubility in water, it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater.</p>\n<p>The free element (metal) is not found naturally on Earth, as it is highly reactive (though once produced, it is coated in a thin layer of oxide (see passivation), which partly masks this reactivity). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant white light, making it a useful ingredient in flares. The metal is now mainly obtained by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine. Commercially, the chief use for the metal is as an alloying agent to make aluminium-magnesium alloys, sometimes called <i>magnalium</i> or <i>magnelium</i>. Since magnesium is less dense than aluminium, these alloys are prized for their relative lightness and strength.</p>\n<p>In human biology, magnesium is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the human body. Its ions are essential to all living cells, where they play a major role in manipulating important biological polyphosphate compounds like ATP, DNA, and RNA. Hundreds of enzymes thus require magnesium ions to function. Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives, antacids (e.g., milk of magnesia), and in a number of situations where stabilization of abnormal nerve excitation and blood vessel spasm is required (e.g., to treat eclampsia). Magnesium ions are sour to the taste, and in low concentrations they help to impart a natural tartness to fresh mineral waters.</p>\n<p>In vegetation, magnesium is the metallic ion at the center of chlorophyll, and is thus a common additive to fertilizers.</p>\n\n<h2>Origin and characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical and chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Elemental magnesium is a rather strong, silvery-white, light-weight metal (two thirds the density of aluminium). It tarnishes slightly when exposed to air, although unlike the alkali metals, an oxygen-free environment is unnecessary for storage because magnesium is protected by a thin layer of oxide that is fairly impermeable and difficult to remove. Like its lower periodic table group neighbor calcium, magnesium reacts with water at room temperature, though it reacts much more slowly than calcium. When submerged in water, hydrogen bubbles almost unnoticeably begin to form on the surface of the metal—though if powdered, it reacts much more rapidly. The reaction occurs faster with higher temperatures (see precautions). Magnesium's ability to react with water can be harnessed to produce energy and run a magnesium-based engine. Magnesium also reacts exothermically with most acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). As with aluminium, zinc and many other metals, the reaction with hydrochloric acid produces the chloride of the metal and releases hydrogen gas.</p>\n<p>Magnesium is a highly flammable metal, but while it is easy to ignite when powdered or shaved into thin strips, it is difficult to ignite in mass or bulk. Once ignited, it is difficult to extinguish, being able to burn in nitrogen (forming magnesium nitride), carbon dioxide (forming magnesium oxide and carbon) and water (forming magnesium oxide and hydrogen). This property was used in incendiary weapons used in the firebombing of cities in World War II, the only practical civil defense being to smother a burning flare under dry sand to exclude the atmosphere. On burning in air, magnesium produces a brilliant white light that includes strong ultraviolet. Thus magnesium powder (flash powder) was used as a source of illumination in the early days of photography. Later, magnesium ribbon was used in electrically ignited flash bulbs. Magnesium powder is used in the manufacture of fireworks and marine flares where a brilliant white light is required. Flame temperatures of magnesium and magnesium alloys can reach 3,100 °C (3,370&nbsp;K; 5,610&nbsp;°F), although flame height above the burning metal is usually less than 300&nbsp;mm (12&nbsp;in). Magnesium may be used as an ignition source for thermite, a mixture of aluminium and iron oxide powder that is otherwise difficult to ignite. Those properties are due to magnesium's high specific heat, the fourth highest specific heat among the metals.</p>\n<p>Magnesium compounds are typically white crystals. Most are soluble in water, providing the sour-tasting magnesium ion Mg. Small amounts of dissolved magnesium ion contribute to the tartness and taste of natural waters. Magnesium ion in large amounts is an ionic laxative, and magnesium sulfate (common name: <i>Epsom salt</i>) is sometimes used for this purpose. So-called \"milk of magnesia\" is a water suspension of one of the few insoluble magnesium compounds, magnesium hydroxide. The undissolved particles give rise to its appearance and name. Milk of magnesia is a mild base commonly used as an antacid, which has some laxative side effect.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<p>Magnesium has three stable isotopes: Mg, Mg and Mg. All are present in significant amounts (see table of isotopes above). About 79% of Mg is Mg. The isotope Mg is radioactive and in the 1950s to 1970s was made commercially by several nuclear power plants for use in scientific experiments. This isotope has a relatively short half-life (21 hours) and so its use was limited by shipping times.</p>\n<p>Mg has found application in isotopic geology, similar to that of aluminium. Mg is a radiogenic daughter product of Al, which has a half-life of 717,000 years. Large enrichments of stable Mg have been observed in the Ca-Al-rich inclusions of some carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The anomalous abundance of Mg is attributed to the decay of its parent Al in the inclusions. Therefore, the meteorite must have formed in the solar nebula before the Al had decayed. Hence, these fragments are among the oldest objects in the solar system and have preserved information about its early history.</p>\n<p>It is conventional to plot Mg/Mg against an Al/Mg ratio. In an isochron dating plot, the Al/Mg ratio plotted isAl/Mg. The slope of the isochron has no age significance, but indicates the initial Al/Al ratio in the sample at the time when the systems were separated from a common reservoir.</p>\n<h3>Creation</h3>\n<p>Magnesium is produced in stars larger than 3 solar masses by fusing helium and neon in the alpha process at temperatures above 600 megakelvins.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also category: Magnesium minerals</div>\n<p>Although magnesium is found in over 60 minerals, only dolomite, magnesite, brucite, carnallite, talc, and olivine are of commercial importance.</p>\n<p>The Mg2+ cation is the second most abundant cation in seawater (occurring at about 12% of the mass of sodium there), which makes seawater and sea-salt an attractive commercial source of Mg. To extract the magnesium, calcium hydroxide is added to seawater to form magnesium hydroxide precipitate.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>MgCl\n2 + Ca(OH)\n2 → Mg(OH)\n2 + CaCl\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Magnesium hydroxide (brucite) is insoluble in water so it can be filtered out, and reacted with hydrochloric acid to obtain concentrated magnesium chloride.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Mg(OH)\n2 + 2 HCl → MgCl\n2 + 2 H\n2O</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>From magnesium chloride, electrolysis produces magnesium.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n\n<p>China is the dominant supplier of magnesium, with approximately 80% of the world market share. China is almost completely reliant on the silicothermic Pidgeon process (the reduction of the oxide at high temperatures with silicon) to obtain the metal.</p>\n<p>In the United States, magnesium is principally obtained by electrolysis of fused magnesium chloride from brines, wells, and sea water. At the cathode, the Mg2+ ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Mg2+ + 2 e− → Mg</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>At the anode, each pair of Cl− ions is oxidized to chlorine gas, releasing two electrons to complete the circuit:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Cl− → Cl\n2 (g) + 2 e−</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>A new process, solid oxide membrane technology, involves the electrolytic reduction of MgO. At the cathode Mg2+ ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal. The electrolyte is Yttria-stabilized zirconia(YSZ). The anode is a liquid metal. At the YSZ/liquid metal anode O2− is reduced. A layer of graphite borders the liquid metal anode, and at this interface carbon and oxygen react to form carbon monoxide. When silver is used as the liquid metal anode, there is no reductant carbon or hydrogen needed, and only oxygen gas is evolved at the anode. It has been reported that this method provides a 40% reduction in cost per pound over the electrolytic reduction method. This method is more environmentally sound than others because there is much less carbon dioxide emitted.</p>\n<p>The United States has traditionally been the major world supplier of this metal, supplying 45% of world production even as recently as 1995. Today, the US market share is at 7%, with a single domestic producer left, US Magnesium, a Renco Group company in Utah born from now-defunct Magcorp.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSir Humphry Davy</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The name magnesium originates from the Greek word for a district in Thessaly called Magnesia. It is related to magnetite and manganese, which also originated from this area, and required differentiation as separate substances. See manganese for this history.</p>\n<p>Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust by mass and tied in seventh place with iron in terms of molarity. It is found in large deposits of magnesite, dolomite, and other minerals, and in mineral waters, where magnesium ion is soluble. In 1618, a farmer at Epsom in England attempted to give his cows water from a well there. The cows refused to drink because of the water's bitter taste, but the farmer noticed that the water seemed to heal scratches and rashes. The substance became known as Epsom salts and its fame spread. It was eventually recognized as hydrated magnesium sulfate, MgSO·7 HO.</p>\n<p>The metal itself was first produced by Sir Humphry Davy in England in 1808. He used electrolysis on a mixture of magnesia and mercuric oxide. Antoine Bussy prepared it in coherent form in 1831. Davy's first suggestion for a name was magnium, but the name magnesium is now used.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>As metal</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAn unusual application of magnesium as an illumination source while wakeskating in 1931</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Magnesium is the third most commonly used structural metal, following iron and aluminium. It has been called the lightest useful metal by The Periodic Table of Videos.</p>\n<p>The main applications of magnesium are, in order: component of aluminium alloys, in die-casting (alloyed with zinc), to remove sulfur in the production of iron and steel, the production of titanium in the Kroll process.</p>\n<p>Magnesium, in its purest form, can be compared with aluminium, and is strong and light, so it is used in several high volume part manufacturing applications, including automotive and truck components. Specialty, high-grade car wheels of magnesium alloy are called \"mag wheels\", although the term is often more broadly misapplied to include aluminium wheels.</p>\n<p>The high magnesium content used for the crankcase of the late-World War II Wright Duplex Cyclone eighteen-cylinder radial aviation engine was a serious problem for the earliest examples of the Boeing B-29 heavy bomber, as engine fires in flight could ignite the engine crankcases, literally \"torching\" the wing spar apart in under a minute, causing wing failure.</p>\n<p>An earlier Mercedes-Benz race car model, the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR, had a body made from Elektron, a magnesium alloy; these cars ran (with successes) at Le Mans, the Mille Miglia, and other world-class race events in 1955 (though one was involved in the single worst accident in auto racing history, in terms of human casualties, at the Le Mans race.) Porsche's all-out quest to decrease the weight of their race cars led to the use of magnesium alloy frames in the famous 917/053 that won Le Mans in 1971, and still holds the absolute distance record.</p>\n<p>Volkswagen Group has used magnesium in its engine components for many years. For a long time, Porsche used magnesium alloy for its engine blocks due to the weight advantage. There is renewed interest in magnesium alloy engine blocks, as featured in the 2006 BMW 325i and 330i models.</p>\n<p>The BMW engine uses an aluminium alloy insert for the cylinder walls and cooling jackets surrounded by a high-temperature magnesium alloy AJ62A.</p>\n<p>The application of magnesium AE44 alloy in the 2006 Corvette Z06 engine cradle has advanced the technology of designing robust automotive parts in magnesium. Both these alloys are recent developments in high-temperature low creep magnesium alloys.</p>\n<p>Mitsubishi Motors also uses magnesium (branded magnesium alloy) for its paddle shifters. The general strategy for such alloys is to form intermetallic precipitates at the grain boundaries, for example by adding mischmetal or calcium. New alloy development and lower costs that make magnesium competitive with aluminium will increase the number of automotive applications.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nProducts made of magnesium: firestarter and shavings, sharpener, magnesium ribbon</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The second application field of magnesium is electronic devices. Because of low weight, good mechanical and electrical properties, magnesium is widely used for manufacturing of mobile phones, laptop and tablet computers, cameras, and other electronic components.</p>\n<p>Historically, magnesium was one of the main aerospace construction metals and was used for German military aircraft as early as World War I and extensively for German aircraft in World War II.</p>\n<p>The Germans coined the name 'Elektron' for magnesium alloy. The term is still used today. The application of magnesium in the commercial aerospace industry was generally restricted to engine related components, due either to perceived hazards with magnesium parts in the event of fire, or corrosion. Currently the use of magnesium alloys in aerospace is increasing, mostly driven by the increasing importance of fuel economy and the need to reduce weight. The development and testing of new magnesium alloys continues, notably Elektron 21, which has successfully undergone extensive aerospace testing for suitability in engine, internal and airframe components. The European Community runs three R&amp;D magnesium projects in the Aerospace priority of Six Framework Program.</p>\n<h4>Niche uses of the metal</h4>\n<p>Magnesium, being readily available and relatively nontoxic, has a variety of uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Magnesium is flammable, burning at a temperature of approximately 3,100 °C (3,370&nbsp;K; 5,610&nbsp;°F), and the autoignition temperature of magnesium ribbon is approximately 473 °C (746&nbsp;K; 883&nbsp;°F). It produces intense, bright, white light when it burns. Magnesium's high combustion temperature makes it a useful tool for starting emergency fires. Other uses include flash photography, flares, pyrotechnics and fireworks sparklers. Magnesium is also often used to ignite thermite, or other materials that require a high ignition temperature.\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMagnesium firestarter (in left hand), used with a pocket knife and flint to create sparks that ignite the shavings</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>In the form of turnings or ribbons, to prepare Grignard reagents, which are useful in organic synthesis.</li>\n<li>As an additive agent in conventional propellants and the production of nodular graphite in cast iron.</li>\n<li>As a reducing agent for the production of uranium and other metals from their salts.</li>\n<li>As a sacrificial (galvanic) anode to protect underground tanks, pipelines, buried structures, and water heaters.</li>\n<li>Alloyed with zinc to produce the zinc sheet used in photoengraving plates in the printing industry, dry-cell battery walls, and roofing.</li>\n<li>As a metal, this element's principal use is as an alloying additive to aluminium with these aluminium-magnesium alloys being used mainly for beverage cans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>In magnesium compounds</h3>\n<p>Magnesium compounds, primarily magnesium oxide (MgO), are used as a refractory material in furnace linings for producing iron, steel, nonferrous metals, glass and cement. Magnesium oxide and other magnesium compounds are also used in the agricultural, chemical, and construction industries.</p>\n<p>Magnesium reacted with an alkyl halide gives a Grignard reagent, which is a very useful tool for preparing alcohols.</p>\n<p>In agriculture and biology, the magnesium ion is necessary for all life (see magnesium in biology), so magnesium salts are frequently included in various foods, fertilizers (magnesium is a component of chlorophyll), and culture media.</p>\n<h4>Niche and illustrative uses of magnesium compounds</h4>\n<h5>Biological</h5>\n<p>Pharmaceutical preparations of magnesium are used to treat magnesium deficiency and hypomagnesemia, as well as eclampsia. Usually in lower dosages, magnesium is commonly included in dietary mineral preparations, including many multivitamin preparations.</p>\n<p>Sorted by type of magnesium salt, biological applications of magnesium include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Magnesium sulfate, as the heptahydrate called Epsom salts, is used as bath salts, as a laxative, and as a highly soluble fertilizer.</li>\n<li>Magnesium hydroxide, suspended in water, is used in milk of magnesia antacids and laxatives.</li>\n<li>Magnesium chloride, oxide, gluconate, malate, orotate, glycinate and citrate are all used as oral magnesium supplements. Some have claimed that oral magnesium supplements are therapeutic for Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) in some individuals.</li>\n<li>Magnesium borate, magnesium salicylate, and magnesium sulfate are used as antiseptics.</li>\n<li>Magnesium bromide is used as a mild sedative (this action is due to the bromide, not the magnesium).</li>\n<li>Magnesium stearate is a slightly flammable white powder with lubricating properties. In pharmaceutical technology, it is used in the manufacturing of numerous kinds of tablets to prevent the tablets from sticking to the equipment during the tablet compression process (i.e., when the tablet's substance is pressed into tablet form).</li>\n<li>Magnesium carbonate powder is used by athletes such as gymnasts, weightlifters and climbers to eliminate moisture and improving the grip on a gymnastic apparatus, lifting bar and climbing rocks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Non biological</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Dead-burned magnesite (magnesium oxide) is used for refractory purposes such as brick and liners in furnaces and converters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Magnesium oxide from calcination is used as an electrical insulator in fire-resistant cables.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Magnesium sulfite is used in the manufacture of paper (sulfite process).</li>\n<li>Magnesium phosphate is used to fireproof wood used in construction.</li>\n<li>Magnesium hexafluorosilicate is used in mothproofing of textiles.</li>\n<li>In the form of turnings or ribbons, Mg is useful in purification of solvents, for example the preparation of super-dry ethanol</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>Main article: Magnesium in biology</div>\n<p>Because of the important interaction between phosphate and magnesium ions, magnesium ions are essential to the basic nucleic acid chemistry of life, and thus are essential to all cells of all known living organisms. Over 300 enzymes require the presence of magnesium ions for their catalytic action, including <i>all</i> enzymes utilizing or synthesizing ATP, or those that use other nucleotides to synthesize DNA and RNA. ATP exists in cells normally as a chelate of ATP and a magnesium ion.</p>\n<p>Plants have an additional use for magnesium in that chlorophylls are magnesium-centered porphyrins. Magnesium deficiency in plants causes late-season yellowing between leaf veins, especially in older leaves, and can be corrected by applying Epsom salts (which is rapidly leached), or else crushed dolomitic limestone to the soil.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nExamples of food sources of magnesium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Magnesium is a vital component of a healthy human diet. Human magnesium deficiency (including conditions that show few overt symptoms) is relatively rare although only 32% of people in the United States meet the RDA-DRI; low levels of magnesium in the body has been associated with the development of a number of human illnesses such as asthma, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Taken in the proper amount magnesium plays a role in preventing both stroke and heart attack. The symptoms of people with fibromyalgia, migraines, and girls going through their premenstrual syndrome are less severe and magnesium can shorten the length of the migraine symptoms.</p>\n<p>Adult human bodies contain about 24&nbsp;grams of magnesium, with 60% in the skeleton, 39% intracellular (20% in skeletal muscle), and 1% extracellular. Serum levels are typically 0.7–1.0&nbsp;mmol/L or 1.8–2.4 mEq/L. Serum magnesium levels may appear normal even in cases of underlying intracellular deficiency, although no known mechanism maintains a homeostatic level in the blood other than renal excretion of high blood levels.</p>\n<p>Intracellular magnesium is correlated with intracellular potassium. Magnesium is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, with more absorbed when status is lower. In humans, magnesium appears to facilitate calcium absorption. Low and high protein intake inhibit magnesium absorption, and other factors such as phosphate, phytate, and fat affect absorption. Absorbed dietary magnesium is largely excreted through the urine, although most magnesium \"administered orally\" is excreted through the feces. Magnesium status may be assessed roughly through serum and erythrocyte Mg concentrations and urinary and fecal excretion, but intravenous magnesium loading tests are likely the most accurate and practical in most people. In these tests, magnesium is injected intravenously; a retention of 20% or more indicates deficiency. Other nutrient deficiencies are identified through biomarkers, but none are established for magnesium.</p>\n<p>Spices, nuts, cereals, coffee, cocoa, tea, and vegetables are rich sources of magnesium. Green leafy vegetables such as spinach are also rich in magnesium as they contain chlorophyll. Observations of reduced dietary magnesium intake in modern Western countries compared to earlier generations may be related to food refining and modern fertilizers that contain no magnesium.</p>\n<p>Numerous pharmaceutical preparations of magnesium, as well as magnesium dietary supplements are available. Magnesium oxide, one of the most common forms in magnesium dietary supplements because it has high magnesium content per weight, has been reported the least bioavailable. Magnesium citrate has been reported as more bioavailable than oxide or amino-acid chelate (glycinate) forms.</p>\n<p>Excess magnesium in the blood is freely filtered at the kidneys, and for this reason it is difficult to overdose on magnesium from dietary sources alone. With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction. Alcoholism can produce a magnesium deficiency, which is easily reversed by oral or parenteral administration, depending on the degree of deficiency.</p>\n<h3>Detection in biological fluids</h3>\n<p>Magnesium concentrations in plasma or serum may be measured to monitor for efficacy and safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. The newborn children of mothers who received parenteral magnesium sulfate during labor may exhibit toxicity at serum magnesium levels that were considered appropriate for the mothers.</p>\n<h3>Magnesium in treatment-resistant depression (TRD)</h3>\n<p>There has been some speculation that magnesium deficiency can lead to depression. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) magnesium has been found low in treatment-resistant suicidal depression and in patients that have attempted suicide. Brain magnesium has been found low in TRD using phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, an accurate means for measuring brain magnesium. Blood and CSF magnesium do not appear well-correlated with major depression. Magnesium chloride in relatively small doses was found as effective in the treatment of depressed elderly type 2 diabetics with hypomagnesemia as imipramine 50&nbsp;mg daily.</p>\n<h3>Magnesium in disease</h3>\n<p>Results from a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials demonstrated that magnesium supplementation lowers high blood pressure in a dose dependent manner. Low serum magnesium levels are associated with metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. Low serum magnesium levels have been associated with a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Magnesium therapy is recommended by the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for Management of Patients With Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death for patients with ventricular arrhythmia associated with torsade de pointes who present with long QT syndrome as well as for the treatment of patients with digoxin intoxication-induced arrhythmias. Magnesium is also the drug of choice in the management of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.</p>\n<p>Besides its therapeutic role, magnesium has an additional beneficial effect on calcification. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a high prevalence of vascular calcification, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this population. Several in vitro and animal studies point towards a protective role of magnesium through multiple molecular mechanisms. Magnesium is a natural calcium antagonist and both human and animal studies have shown that low circulating magnesium levels are associated with vascular calcification. Results from an observational study conducted in the general Japanese population demonstrated that lower serum magnesium levels were significantly and independently associated with a greater average intima-media thickness and the risk of at least two carotid plaques. Magnesium supplementation might be useful in reducing the progression of atherosclerosis in chronic dialysis patients. Low serum magnesium may be an independent risk factor for death in patients with chronic kidney disease, and patients with mildly elevated serum magnesium levels could have a survival advantage over those with lower magnesium levels.</p>\n<h2>Safety precautions for magnesium metal</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe magnesium-bodied Honda RA302 of Jo Schlesser crashes and burns during the 1968 French Grand Prix. Schlesser was killed. The magnesium car body did not cause the fire or the death, but it greatly hindered attempts to douse the fire with water.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Magnesium metal and its alloys are explosive hazards; they are highly flammable in their pure form when molten or in powder or ribbon form. Burning or molten magnesium metal reacts violently with water. When working with powdered magnesium, safety glasses with welding eye protection are employed, because the bright white light produced by burning magnesium contains ultraviolet light that can permanently damage the retinas of the eyes.</p>\n<p>Magnesium is capable of reducing water to highly flammable hydrogen gas:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Mg (s) + 2 H\n2O (l) → Mg(OH)\n2 (s) + H\n2 (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>As a result, water cannot extinguish magnesium fires. The hydrogen gas produced only intensifies the fire. Dry sand is an effective smothering agent, but only on relatively level and flat surfaces.</p>\n<p>Magnesium also reacts with carbon dioxide to form magnesium oxide and carbon:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Mg (s) + CO\n2 → 2 MgO (s) + C (s)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>hence, carbon dioxide fire extinguishers cannot be used for extinguishing magnesium fires either.</p>\n<p>Burning magnesium is usually quenched by using a Class D dry chemical fire extinguisher, or by covering the fire with sand or magnesium foundry flux to remove its air source.</p>\n"

  "title": "Silicon",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with the silicon-containing synthetic polymer silicone.</div>\n\n<p><b>Silicon</b>, a tetravalent metalloid, is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Si</b> and atomic number 14. It is less reactive than its chemical analog carbon, the nonmetal directly above it in the periodic table, but more reactive than germanium, the metalloid directly below it in the table. Controversy about silicon's character dates to its discovery; it was first prepared and characterized in pure form in 1823. In 1808, it was given the name silicium (from Latin: silicis, flints), with an <b>-ium</b> word-ending to suggest a metal, a name which the element retains in several non-English languages. However, its final English name, first suggested in 1817, reflects the more physically similar elements carbon and boron.</p>\n<p>Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure free element in nature. It is most widely distributed in dusts, sands, planetoids, and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. Over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after oxygen.</p>\n<p>Most silicon is used commercially without being separated, and indeed often with little processing of compounds from nature. These include direct industrial building-use of clays, silica sand and stone. Silica is used in ceramic brick. Silicate goes into Portland cement for mortar and stucco, and when combined with silica sand and gravel, to make concrete. Silicates are also in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain, and in traditional quartz-based soda-lime glass. More modern silicon compounds such as silicon carbide form abrasives and high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the ubiquitous synthetic silicon-based polymers called silicones.</p>\n<p>Elemental silicon also has a large impact on the modern world economy. Although most free silicon is used in the steel refining, aluminum-casting, and fine chemical industries (often to make fumed silica), the relatively small portion of very highly purified silicon that is used in semiconductor electronics (&lt; 10%) is perhaps even more critical. Because of wide use of silicon in integrated circuits, the basis of most computers, a great deal of modern technology depends on it.</p>\n<p>Silicon is an essential element in biology, although only tiny traces of it appear to be required by animals. However, various sea sponges as well as microorganisms like diatoms need silicon in order to have structure. It is much more important to the metabolism of plants, particularly many grasses.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSilicon crystallizes in a diamond cubic crystal structure</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Further information: Monocrystalline silicon</div>\n<p>Silicon is a solid at room temperature, with relatively high melting and boiling points of 1414 and 3265 degrees Celsius respectively. It has a greater density in a liquid state than a solid state. It does not contract when it freezes like most substances, but expands, similar to how ice is less dense than water. With a relatively high thermal conductivity of 149 W·m·K, silicon conducts heat well and as a result is not often used to insulate hot objects.</p>\n<p>In its crystalline form, pure silicon has a gray color and a metallic luster. Like germanium, silicon is rather strong, very brittle, and prone to chipping. Silicon, like carbon and germanium, crystallizes in a diamond cubic crystal structure, with a lattice spacing of 0.5430710&nbsp;nm (5.430710 Å).</p>\n<p>The outer electron orbital of silicon, like that of carbon, has four valence electrons. The 1<i>s</i>, 2<i>s</i>, 2<i>p</i> and 3<i>s</i> subshells are completely filled while the 3<i>p</i> subshell contains two electrons out of a possible six.</p>\n<p>Silicon is a semiconductor. It has a negative temperature coefficient of resistance, since the number of free charge carriers increases with temperature. The electrical resistance of single crystal silicon significantly changes under the application of mechanical stress due to the piezoresistive effect.</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSilicon powder</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Silicon is a metalloid, readily either donating or sharing its four outer electrons, allowing for many forms of chemical bonding. Like carbon, it typically forms four bonds. Unlike carbon, it can accept additional electrons and form five or six bonds in a sometimes more labile silicate form. Tetra-valent silicon is relatively inert, but still reacts with halogens and dilute alkalis, but most acids (except for some hyper-reactive combinations of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid) have no known effect on it. However, having four bonding electrons gives it, like carbon, many opportunities to combine with other elements or compounds under the right circumstances.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: isotopes of silicon</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable isotopes, silicon-28, silicon-29, and silicon-30, with silicon-28 being the most abundant (92% natural abundance). Out of these, only silicon-29 is of use in NMR and EPR spectroscopy. Twenty radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being silicon-32 with a half-life of 170 years, and silicon-31 with a half-life of 157.3 minutes. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than seven seconds, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than one tenth of a second. Silicon does not have any known nuclear isomers.</p>\n<p>The isotopes of silicon range in mass number from 22 to 44. The most common decay mode of six isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most abundant stable isotope, silicon-28, is β+, primarily forming aluminium isotopes (13 protons) as decay products. The most common decay mode(s) for 16 isotopes with mass numbers higher than silicon-28 is β−, primarily forming phosphorus isotopes (15 protons) as decay products.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nQuartz crystal cluster from Tibet. The naturally occurring mineral is a network solid with the formula SiO.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Silicate minerals</div>\n<p>Measured by mass, silicon makes up 27.7% of the Earth's crust and is the second most abundant element in the crust, with only oxygen having a greater abundance. Silicon is usually found in the form of complex silicate minerals, and less often as silicon dioxide (<b>silica</b>, a major component of common sand). Pure silicon crystals are very rarely found in nature.</p>\n<p>The silicate minerals—various minerals containing silicon, oxygen and reactive metals—account for 90% of the mass of the Earth's crust. This is due to the fact that at the high temperatures characteristic of the formation of the inner solar system, silicon and oxygen have a great affinity for each other, forming networks of silicon and oxygen in chemical compounds of very low volatility. Since oxygen and silicon were the most common non-gaseous and non-metallic elements in the debris from supernova dust which formed the protoplanetary disk in the formation and evolution of the Solar System, they formed many complex silicates which accreted into larger rocky planetesimals that formed the terrestrial planets. Here, the reduced silicate mineral matrix entrapped the metals reactive enough to be oxidized (aluminum, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium). After loss of volatile gases, as well as carbon and sulfur via reaction with hydrogen, this silicate mixture of elements formed most of the Earth's crust. These silicates were of relatively low density with respect to iron, nickel, and other metals non-reactive to oxygen and thus a residuum of uncombined iron and nickel sank to the planet's core, leaving a thick mantle consisting mostly of magnesium and iron silicates above.</p>\n<p>Examples of silicate minerals in the crust include those in the pyroxene, amphibole, mica, and feldspar groups. These minerals occur in clay and various types of rock such as granite and sandstone.</p>\n<p>Silica occurs in minerals consisting of very pure silicon dioxide in different crystalline forms, quartz, agate amethyst, rock crystal, chalcedony, flint, jasper, and opal. The crystals have the empirical formula of silicon dioxide, but do not consist of separate silicon dioxide molecules in the manner of solid carbon dioxide. Rather, silica is structurally a network-solid consisting of silicon and oxygen in three-dimensional crystals, like diamond. Less pure silica forms the natural glass obsidian. Biogenic silica occurs in the structure of diatoms, radiolaria and siliceous sponges.</p>\n<p>Silicon is also a principal component of many meteorites, and is a component of tektites, a silicate mineral of possibly lunar origin, or (if Earth-derived) which has been subjected to unusual temperatures and pressures, possibly from meteorite strike.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFerrosilicon alloy</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Ferrosilicon, an iron-silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron, accounts for about 80% of the world's production of elemental silicon, with China, the leading supplier of elemental silicon, providing 4.6 million tonnes (or 2/3 of the world output) of silicon, most of which is in the form of ferrosilicon. It is followed by Russia (610,000 t), Norway (330,000 t), Brazil (240,000 t) and the United States (170,000 t). Ferrosilicon is primarily used by the steel industry (see below).</p>\n<p>Aluminum-silicon alloys are heavily used in the aluminum alloy casting industry, where silicon is the single most important additive to aluminum to improve its casting properties. Since cast aluminum is widely used in the automobile industry, this use of silicon is thus the single largest industrial use of \"metallurgical grade\" pure silicon (as this purified silicon is added to pure aluminum, whereas ferrosilicon is never purified before being added to steel).</p>\n<h3>Metallurgical grade</h3>\n<p>Elemental silicon not alloyed with significant quantities of other elements, and usually &gt; 95%, is often referred to loosely as <b>silicon metal</b>. It makes up about 20% of the world total elemental silicon production, with less than 1 to 2% of total elemental silicon (5–10% of metallurgical grade silicon) ever purified to higher grades for use in electronics. Metallurgical grade silicon is commercially prepared by the reaction of high-purity silica with wood, charcoal, and coal in an electric arc furnace using carbon electrodes. At temperatures over 1,900&nbsp;°C (3,450&nbsp;°F), the carbon in the aforementioned materials and the silicon undergo the chemical reaction SiO + 2 C → Si + 2 CO. Liquid silicon collects in the bottom of the furnace, which is then drained and cooled. The silicon produced this manner is called <i>metallurgical grade silicon</i> and is at least 98% pure. Using this method, silicon carbide (SiC) may also form from an excess of carbon in one or both of the following ways: SiO + C → SiO + CO or SiO + 2 C → SiC + CO. However, provided the concentration of SiO is kept high, the silicon carbide can be eliminated by the chemical reaction 2 SiC + SiO → 3 Si + 2 CO.</p>\n<p>As noted above, metallurgical grade silicon \"metal\" has its primary use in the aluminum casting industry to make aluminum-silicon alloy parts. The remainder (about 45%) is used by the chemical industry, where it is primarily employed to make fumed silica.</p>\n<p>As of September 2008, metallurgical grade silicon costs about US$1.45 per pound ($3.20/kg), up from $0.77 per pound ($1.70/kg) in 2005.</p>\n<h3>Electronic grade </h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMonocrystalline silicon ingot grown by the Czochralski process</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The use of silicon in semiconductor devices demands a much greater purity than afforded by metallurgical grade silicon. Very pure silicon (&gt;99.9%) can be extracted directly from solid silica or other silicon compounds by molten salt electrolysis. This method, known as early as 1854 (see also FFC Cambridge process), has the potential to directly produce solar-grade silicon without any carbon dioxide emission at much lower energy consumption.</p>\n<p>Solar grade silicon cannot be used for semiconductors, where purity must be extreme to properly control the process. Bulk silicon wafers used at the beginning of the integrated circuit making process must first be refined to \"nine nines\" purity (99.9999999%), a process which requires repeated applications of refining technology.</p>\n<p>The majority of silicon crystals grown for device production are produced by the Czochralski process, (CZ-Si) since it is the cheapest method available and it is capable of producing large size crystals. However, single crystals grown by the Czochralski process contain impurities because the crucible containing the melt often dissolves. Historically, a number of methods have been used to produce ultra-high-purity silicon.</p>\n<p>Early silicon purification techniques were based on the fact that if silicon is melted and re-solidified, the last parts of the mass to solidify contain most of the impurities. The earliest method of silicon purification, first described in 1919 and used on a limited basis to make radar components during World War II, involved crushing metallurgical grade silicon and then partially dissolving the silicon powder in an acid. When crushed, the silicon cracked so that the weaker impurity-rich regions were on the outside of the resulting grains of silicon. As a result, the impurity-rich silicon was the first to be dissolved when treated with acid, leaving behind a more pure product.</p>\n<p>In zone melting, also called zone refining, the first silicon purification method to be widely used industrially, rods of metallurgical grade silicon are heated to melt at one end. Then, the heater is slowly moved down the length of the rod, keeping a small length of the rod molten as the silicon cools and re-solidifies behind it. Since most impurities tend to remain in the molten region rather than re-solidify, when the process is complete, most of the impurities in the rod will have been moved into the end that was the last to be melted. This end is then cut off and discarded, and the process repeated if a still higher purity is desired.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA polycrystalline silicon rod made by the Siemens process</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>At one time, DuPont produced ultra-pure silicon by reacting silicon tetrachloride with high-purity zinc vapors at 950 °C, producing silicon by SiCl + 2 Zn → Si + 2 ZnCl. However, this technique was plagued with practical problems (such as the zinc chloride byproduct solidifying and clogging lines) and was eventually abandoned in favor of the Siemens process. In the <i>Siemens process</i>, high-purity silicon rods are exposed to trichlorosilane at 1150 °C. The trichlorosilane gas decomposes and deposits additional silicon onto the rods, enlarging them because 2 HSiCl → Si + 2 HCl + SiCl. Silicon produced from this and similar processes is called <i>polycrystalline silicon</i>. Polycrystalline silicon typically has impurity levels of less than one part per billion.</p>\n<p>In 2006 REC announced construction of a plant based on <i>fluidized bed</i> (FB) technology using silane: 3 SiCl + Si + 2 H → 4 HSiCl, 4 HSiCl → 3 SiCl + SiH, SiH → Si + 2 H. The advantage of fluid bed technology is that processes can be run continuously, yielding higher yields than Siemens Process, which is a batch process.</p>\n<p>Today, silicon is purified by converting it to a silicon compound that can be more easily purified by distillation than in its original state, and then converting that silicon compound back into pure silicon. Trichlorosilane is the silicon compound most commonly used as the intermediate, although silicon tetrachloride and silane are also used. When these gases are blown over silicon at high temperature, they decompose to high-purity silicon.</p>\n<p>In addition, there is the <i>Schumacher process</i>, which utilizes tribromosilane in place of trichlorosilane and fluid bed technology. It requires lower deposition temperatures, lower capital costs to build facilities and operate, no hazardous polymers nor explosive material, and produces no amorphous silicon dust waste, all of which are drawbacks of the Siemens process. However, there are yet to be any major factories built using this process.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPDMS – a silicone compound</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Silicon forms binary compounds called silicides with many metallic elements whose properties range from reactive compounds, e.g. magnesium silicide, MgSi through high melting refractory compounds such as molybdenum disilicide, MoSi.</li>\n<li>Silicon carbide, SiC (carborundum) is a hard, high melting solid and a well known abrasive. It may also be sintered into a type of high-strength ceramic used in armor.</li>\n<li>Silane, SiH, is a pyrophoric gas with a similar tetrahedral structure to methane, CH. When pure, it does not react with pure water or dilute acids; however, even small amounts of alkali impurities from the laboratory glass can result in a rapid hydrolysis. There is a range of catenated silicon hydrides that form a homologous series of compounds, Si\nnH\n2n+2 where <i>n</i> = 2–8 (analogous to the alkanes). These are all readily hydrolyzed and are thermally unstable, particularly the heavier members.</li>\n<li>Disilenes contain a silicon-silicon double bond (analogous to the alkenes) and are generally highly reactive requiring large substituent groups to stabilize them. A disilyne with a silicon-silicon triple bond was first isolated in 2004; although as the compound is non-linear, the bonding is dissimilar to that in alkynes.</li>\n<li>Tetrahalides, SiX, are formed with all the halogens. Silicon tetrachloride, for example, reacts with water, unlike its carbon analogue, carbon tetrachloride. Silicon dihalides are formed by the high temperature reaction of tetrahalides and silicon; with a structure analogous to a carbene they are reactive compounds. Silicon difluoride condenses to form a polymeric compound, (SiF\n2)\nn.</li>\n<li>Silicon dioxide is a high melting solid with a number of crystal forms; the most familiar of which is the mineral quartz. In quartz each silicon atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms that bridge to other silicon atoms to form a three dimensional lattice. Silica is soluble in water at high temperatures forming a range of compounds called <i>monosilicic acid</i>, Si(OH).</li>\n<li>Under the right conditions monosilicic acid readily polymerizes to form more complex silicic acids, ranging from the simplest condensate, disilicic acid (HSiO) to linear, ribbon, layer and lattice structures which form the basis of the many silicate minerals and are called <i>polysilicic acids</i> {Si(OH)}.</li>\n<li>With oxides of other elements the high temperature reaction of silicon dioxide can give a wide range of glasses with various properties. Examples include soda lime glass, borosilicate glass and lead crystal glass.</li>\n<li>Silicon sulfide, SiS, is a polymeric solid (unlike its carbon analogue the liquid CS).</li>\n<li>Silicon forms a nitride, SiN which is a ceramic. Silatranes, a group of tricyclic compounds containing five-coordinate silicon, may have physiological properties.</li>\n<li>Many transition metal complexes containing a metal-silicon bond are now known, which include complexes containing SiH\nnX\n3−n ligands, SiX ligands, and Si(OR) ligands.</li>\n<li>Silicones are large group of polymeric compounds with an (Si-O-Si) backbone. An example is the silicone oil PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane). These polymers can be crosslinked to produce resins and elastomers.</li>\n<li>Many organosilicon compounds are known which contain a silicon-carbon single bond. Many of these are based on a central tetrahedral silicon atom, and some are optically active when central chirality exists. Long chain polymers containing a silicon backbone are known, such as polydimethysilylene (SiMe\n2)\nn. Polycarbosilane, [(SiMe\n2)\n2CH\n2]\nn with a backbone containing a repeating -Si-Si-C unit, is a precursor in the production of silicon carbide fibers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Attention was first drawn to silica as the possible oxide of a fundamental chemical element by Antoine Lavoisier, in 1787. After an attempt to isolate silicon in 1808, Sir Humphry Davy proposed the name \"silicium\" for silicon, from the Latin <i>silex</i>, <i>silicis</i> for flint, flints, and adding the \"-ium\" ending because he believed it was a metal. In 1811, Gay-Lussac and Thénard are thought to have prepared impure amorphous silicon, through the heating of recently isolated potassium metal with silicon tetrafluoride, but they did not purify and characterize the product, nor identify it as a new element. Silicon was given its present name in 1817 by Scottish chemist Thomas Thomson. He retained part of Davy's name but added \"-on\" because he believed that silicon was a nonmetal similar to boron and carbon. In 1823, Berzelius prepared amorphous silicon using approximately the same method as Gay-Lussac (potassium metal and potassium fluorosilicate), but purifying the product to a brown powder by repeatedly washing it. As a result he is usually given credit for the element's discovery.</p>\n<p>Silicon in its more common crystalline form was not prepared until 31 years later, by Deville. By electrolyzing impure sodium-aluminum chloride containing approximately 10% silicon, he was able to obtain a slightly impure allotrope of silicon in 1854. Later, more cost-effective methods have been developed to isolate silicon in several allotrope forms, the most recent being silicene.</p>\n<p>Because silicon is an important element in semiconductors and high-technology devices, many places in the world bear its name. For example, Silicon Valley in California, since it is the base for a number of technology-related industries, bears the name <i>silicon</i>. Other geographic locations with connections to the industry have since been named after silicon as well. Examples include Silicon Forest in Oregon, Silicon Hills in Austin, Texas, Silicon Saxony in Germany, Silicon Valley in India, Silicon Border in Mexicali, Mexico, Silicon Fen in Cambridge, England, Silicon Roundabout in London, Silicon Glen in Scotland, and Silicon Gorge in Bristol, England.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<p>Most silicon is used industrially without being separated into the element, and indeed often with comparatively little processing from natural occurrence. Over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, silica sand and most kinds of building stone. Thus, the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). For example, silica is an important part of ceramic brick. Silicates are used in making Portland cement which is used in building mortar and stucco, but more importantly combined with silica sand, and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals like granite), to make the concrete that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world. </p>\n<p>Silicate minerals are also in whiteware ceramics, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired clay (natural aluminum silicate). An example is porcelain which is based on silicate mineral kaolinite. Ceramics include art objects, and domestic, industrial and building products. Traditional quartz-based soda-lime glass also functions in many of the same roles.</p>\n<p>More modern silicon compounds also function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon (silicon carbide), and in superalloys.</p>\n<p>Alternating silicon-oxygen chains with hydrogen attached to the remaining silicon bonds form the ubiquitous silicon-based polymeric materials known as silicones. These compounds containing silicon-oxygen and occasionally silicon-carbon bonds have the capability to act as bonding intermediates between glass and organic compounds, and to form polymers with useful properties such as impermeability to water, flexibility and resistance to chemical attack. Silicones are often used in waterproofing treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature greases and waxes, and caulking compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly Putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>Elemental silicon is added to molten cast iron as ferrosilicon or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of cementite where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon.</p>\n<p>The properties of silicon itself can be used to modify alloys. Silicon's importance in aluminum casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminum forms a eutectic mixture which solidifies with very little thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminum. Silicon is an important constituent of electrical steel, modifying its resistivity and ferromagnetic properties.</p>\n<p>Metallurgical grade silicon is silicon of 95–99% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminum-silicon alloys for aluminum part casts, mainly for use in the automotive industry. The reason for the high silicon use in these alloys is noted above. Much of the rest of metallurgical-grade silicon is used by the chemical industry for production of the important industrial product fumed silica. The remainder is used in production of other fine chemicals such as silanes and some types of silicones.</p>\n<h3>Electronics</h3>\n<div>Main article: Semiconductor device fabrication</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSilicon wafer with mirror finish</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Since most elemental silicon produced remains as ferrosilicon alloy, only a relatively small amount (20%) of the elemental silicon produced is refined to metallurgical grade purity (a total of 1.3–1.5 million metric tons/year). The fraction of silicon metal which is further refined to semiconductor purity is estimated at only 15% of the world production of metallurgical grade silicon. However, the economic importance of this small very high-purity fraction (especially the ~ 5% which is processed to monocrystalline silicon for use in integrated circuits) is disproportionately large.</p>\n<p>Pure monocrystalline silicon is used to produce silicon wafers used in the semiconductor industry, in electronics and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. In terms of charge conduction, pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor which means that unlike metals it conducts electron holes and electrons which may be released from atoms within the crystal by heat, and thus increase silicon's electrical conductivity with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a resistivity) to be used as a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements, a process that greatly increases its conductivity and adjusts its electrical response by controlling the number and charge (positive or negative) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for transistors, solar cells, semiconductor detectors and other semiconductor devices, which are used in the computer industry and other technical applications. For example, in silicon photonics, silicon can be used as a continuous wave Raman laser medium to produce coherent light, though it is ineffective as an everyday light source.</p>\n<p>In common integrated circuits, a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support for the circuits, which are created by doping, and insulated from each other by thin layers of silicon oxide, an insulator which is easily produced by exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions. Silicon has become the most popular material to build both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits. The reason is that silicon is the semiconductor that can withstand the highest temperatures and electrical powers without becoming dysfunctional due to avalanche breakdown (a process in which an electron avalanche is created by a chain reaction process whereby heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn produce more current which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over germanium (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain type of fabrication techniques.</p>\n<p>Monocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually only justified in production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon which do not exist as single crystals may be employed. These include hydrogenated amorphous silicon and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) which are used in the production of low-cost, large-area electronics in applications such as liquid crystal displays, and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film solar cells. Such semiconductor grades of silicon which are either slightly less pure than those used in integrated circuits, or which are produced in polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline form, make up roughly similar amount of silicon as are produced for the monocrystalline silicon semiconductor industry, or 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year. However, production of such materials is growing more quickly than silicon for the integrated circuit market. By 2013 polycrystalline silicon production, used mostly in solar cells, is projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor silicon production (used in computer microchips) remains below 50,000 tons/year.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSilica skeletons of radiolaria in false color.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Although silicon is readily available in the form of silicates, very few organisms have a use for it. Diatoms, radiolaria and siliceous sponges use biogenic silica as a structural material to construct skeletons. In more advanced plants, the silica phytoliths (opal phytoliths) are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in the cell; some plants, for example rice, need silicon for their growth. Although silicon was proposed to be an ultra trace nutrient, its exact function in the biology of animals is still under discussion. Higher organisms are only known to use it in very limited occasions in the form of silicic acid and soluble silicates.</p>\n<p>Silicon is known to be needed for synthesis of elastin and collagen; the aorta contains the highest quantity of elastin and silicon.</p>\n<p>Silicon is currently under consideration for elevation to the status of a \"plant beneficial substance by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO).\" Silicon has been shown in university and field studies to improve plant cell wall strength and structural integrity, improve drought and frost resistance, decrease lodging potential and boost the plant's natural pest and disease fighting systems. Silicon has also been shown to improve plant vigor and physiology by improving root mass and density, and increasing above ground plant biomass and crop yields.</p>\n<p>Hypothetical silicon-based lifeforms are the subject of silicon biochemistry, by analogy with carbon-based lifeforms. Silicon, being below carbon in the periodic table, is thought to have similar enough properties that would make silicon-based life possible, but much different from life as we know it.</p>\n"

  "title": "Phosphorus",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Phosphorus (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Phosphorus</b> is a nonmetallic chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>P</b> and atomic number&nbsp;15. A multivalent pnictogen, phosphorus as a mineral is almost always present in its maximally oxidised state, as inorganic phosphate rocks. Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms—white phosphorus and red phosphorus—but due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth.</p>\n<p>The first form of elemental phosphorus to be produced (white phosphorus, in 1669) emits a faint glow upon exposure to oxygen – hence its name given from Greek mythology, Φωσφόρος meaning \"light-bearer\" (Latin <i>Lucifer</i>), referring to the \"Morning Star\", the planet Venus. The term \"phosphorescence\", meaning glow after illumination, originally derives from this property of phosphorus, although this word has since been used for a different physical process that produces a glow. The glow of phosphorus itself originates from oxidation of the white (but not red) phosphorus— a process now termed chemiluminescence.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of phosphorus compounds are consumed as fertilisers. Other applications include the role of organophosphorus compounds in detergents, pesticides and nerve agents, and matches.</p>\n<p>Phosphorus is essential for life. As phosphate, it is a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and also the phospholipids that form all cell membranes. Demonstrating the link between phosphorus and life, elemental phosphorus was historically first isolated from human urine, and bone ash was an important early phosphate source. Phosphate minerals are fossils. Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in some aquatic systems. The chief commercial use of phosphorus compounds for production of fertilisers is due to the need to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>Main article: Allotropes of phosphorus</div>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nP molecule</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Phosphorus exists as several forms (allotropes) that exhibit strikingly different properties. The two most common allotropes are <b>white phosphorus</b> and <b>red phosphorus</b>. Another form, scarlet phosphorus, is obtained by allowing a solution of white phosphorus in carbon disulfide to evaporate in sunlight. Black phosphorus is obtained by heating white phosphorus under high pressures (about 12,000 standard atmospheres or 1.2 gigapascals). In appearance, properties, and structure, it resembles graphite, being black and flaky, a conductor of electricity, and has puckered sheets of linked atoms. Another allotrope is diphosphorus; it contains a phosphorus dimer as a structural unit and is highly reactive.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWhite phosphorus</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWhite phosphorus exposed to air glows in the darkness</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>White phosphorus and related molecular forms</h4>\n<p>The most important form of elemental phosphorus from the perspective of applications and the chemical literature is white phosphorus. It consists of tetrahedral P\n4 molecules, in which each atom is bound to the other three atoms by a single bond. This P\n4 tetrahedron is also present in liquid and gaseous phosphorus up to the temperature of 800&nbsp;°C when it starts decomposing to P\n2 molecules. Solid white exists in two forms. At low-temperatures, the β form is stable. At high-temperatures the α form is predominant. These forms differ in terms of the relative orientations of the constituent P tetrahedra.</p>\n<p>White phosphorus is the least stable, the most reactive, the most volatile, the least dense, and the most toxic of the allotropes. White phosphorus gradually changes to red phosphorus. This transformation is accelerated by light and heat, and samples of white phosphorus almost always contain some red phosphorus and accordingly appear yellow. For this reason it is also called yellow phosphorus. It glows in the dark (when exposed to oxygen) with a very faint tinge of green and blue, is highly flammable and pyrophoric (self-igniting) upon contact with air and is toxic (causing severe liver damage on ingestion). Owing to its pyrophoricity, white phosphorus is used as an additive in napalm. The odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell, and samples are commonly coated with white \"(di)phosphorus pentoxide\", which consists of P\n4O\n10 tetrahedra with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices. White phosphorus is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide.</p>\n<p>Thermolysis (cracking) of P at 1100&nbsp;kelvin) gives diphosphorus, P. This species is not stable as a solid or liquid. The dimeric unit contains a triple bond and is analogous to N. It can also be generated as a transient intermediate in solution by thermolysis of organophosphorus precursor reagents. At still higher temperatures, P dissociates into atomic P.</p>\n<p>Although the term phosphorescence is derived from phosphorus, the reaction that gives phosphorus its glow is properly called chemiluminescence (glowing due to a cold chemical reaction), not phosphorescence (re-emitting light that previously fell onto a substance and excited it).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCrystal structure of red phosphorus</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nred phosphorus</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Red phosphorus</h4>\n<p>Red phosphorus is polymeric in structure. It can be viewed as a derivative of P wherein one P-P bond is broken, and one additional bond is formed with the neighbouring tetrahedron resulting in a chain-like structure. Red phosphorus may be formed by heating white phosphorus to 250&nbsp;°C (482&nbsp;°F) or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight. Phosphorus after this treatment is amorphous. Upon further heating, this material crystallises. In this sense, red phosphorus is not an allotrope, but rather an intermediate phase between the white and violet phosphorus, and most of its properties have a range of values. For example, freshly prepared, bright red phosphorus is highly reactive and ignites at about 300 °C, though it is still more stable than white phosphorus, which ignites at about 30&nbsp;°C. After prolonged heating or storage, the color darkens (see infobox images); the resulting product is more stable and does not spontaneously ignite in air.</p>\n<h4>Violet phosphorus</h4>\n<p>Violet phosphorus is a form of phosphorus that can be produced by day-long annealing of red phosphorus above 550 °C. In 1865, Hittorf discovered that when phosphorus was recrystallized from molten lead, a red/purple form is obtained. Therefore this form is sometimes known as \"Hittorf's phosphorus\" (or violet or α-metallic phosphorus).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCrystal structure of black phosphorus</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Black phosphorus</h4>\n<p>Black phosphorus is the least reactive allotrope and the thermodynamically stable form below 550 °C. It is also known as β-metallic phosphorus and has a structure somewhat resembling that of graphite. High pressures are usually required to produce black phosphorus, but it can also be produced at ambient conditions using metal salts as catalysts.</p>\n\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of phosphorus</div>\n<p>Twenty-three isotopes of phosphorus are known, including all possibilities from 24P up to 46P. Only 31P is stable and is therefore present at 100% abundance. The half-integer nuclear spin and high abundance of P make phosphorus-31 NMR spectroscopy a very useful analytical tool in studies of phosphorus-containing samples.</p>\n<p>Two radioactive isotopes of phosphorus have half-lives that make them useful for scientific experiments. P has a half-life of 14.262 days and P has a half-life of 25.34 days. Biomolecules can be \"tagged\" with a radioisotope to allow for the study of very dilute samples.</p>\n<p>Radioactive isotopes of phosphorus include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>32P, a beta-emitter (1.71 MeV) with a half-life of 14.3 days, which is used routinely in life-science laboratories, primarily to produce radiolabeled DNA and RNA probes, <i>e.g.</i> for use in Northern blots or Southern blots. Because the high energy beta particles produced penetrate skin and corneas, and because any 32P ingested, inhaled, or absorbed is readily incorporated into bone and nucleic acids, Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States, and similar institutions in other developed countries require that a lab coat, disposable gloves and safety glasses or goggles be worn when working with 32P, and that working directly over an open container be avoided in order to protect the eyes. Monitoring personal, clothing, and surface contamination is also required. In addition, due to the high energy of the beta particles, shielding this radiation with the normally used dense materials (<i>e.g.</i> lead), gives rise to secondary emission of X-rays via Bremsstrahlung (braking radiation). Therefore shielding must be accomplished with low density materials, <i>e.g.</i> Plexiglas (Lucite), other plastics, water, or (when transparency is not required), even wood.</li>\n<li>33P, a beta-emitter (0.25&nbsp;MeV) with a half-life of 25.4 days. It is used in life-science laboratories in applications in which lower energy beta emissions are advantageous such as DNA sequencing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also category: Phosphate minerals</div>\n<p>In terms of stellar nucleosynthesis, stable forms of phosphorus are produced in large (greater than 3 solar masses) stars by fusing two oxygen atoms together. This requires temperatures above 1,000 megakelvins.</p>\n<p>Phosphorus is not found free in nature, but it is widely distributed in many minerals, mainly phosphates. Historically-important but limited commercial sources were organic, such as bone ash and (in the latter 19 century) guano. Inorganic phosphate rock, which is partially made of apatite (an impure tri-calcium phosphate mineral), is today the chief commercial source of this element. About 50 percent of the global phosphorus reserves are in the Arab nations. Large deposits of apatite are located in China, Russia, Morocco, Florida, Idaho, Tennessee, Utah, and elsewhere. Albright and Wilson in the United Kingdom and their Niagara Falls plant, for instance, were using phosphate rock in the 1890s and 1900s from Tennessee, Florida, and the Îles du Connétable (guano island sources of phosphate); by 1950 they were using phosphate rock mainly from Tennessee and North Africa. In the early 1990s Albright and Wilson's purified wet phosphoric acid business was being adversely affected by phosphate rock sales by China and the entry of their long-standing Moroccan phosphate suppliers into the purified wet phosphoric acid business.</p>\n<p>In 2012, the USGS estimated 71 billion tons of world reserves, where reserve figures refer to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices; 0.19 billion tons were mined in 2011.</p>\n<p>Recent reports suggest that production of phosphorus may have peaked, leading to the possibility of global shortages by 2040. In 2007, at the rate of consumption, the supply of phosphorus was estimated to run out in 345 years. However, some scientists now believe that a \"peak phosphorus\" will occur in 30 years and that \"At current rates, reserves will be depleted in the next 50 to 100 years.\" Phosphorus comprises about 0.1% by mass of the average rock, and consequently the Earth's supply is vast, although dilute.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>Main article: phosphoric acid</div>\n<p>The majority of phosphorus-containing compounds are produced for use as fertilisers. For this purpose, phosphate-containing minerals are converted to phosphoric acid. Two distinct routes are employed, the main one being treatment of phosphate minerals with sulfuric acid. The other process utilises white phosphorus, which may be produced by reaction and distillation from very low grade phosphate sources. The white phosphorus is then oxidised to phosphoric acid and subsequently neutralised with base to give phosphate salts. Phosphoric acid obtained via white phosphorus is relatively pure and is the main source of phosphates used in detergents and other non-fertiliser applications.</p>\n<h3>Elemental phosphorus</h3>\n<p>Presently, about 1,000,000 short tons (910,000 t) of elemental phosphorus is produced annually. Calcium phosphate (phosphate rock), mostly mined in Florida and North Africa, can be heated to 1,200–1,500&nbsp;°C with sand, which is mostly SiO\n2, and coke (impure carbon) to produce vaporized P\n4. The product is subsequently condensed into a white powder under water to prevent oxidation by air. Even under water, white phosphorus is slowly converted to the more stable red phosphorus allotrope. The chemical equation for this process when starting with fluoroapatite, a common phosphate mineral, is:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Ca(PO)F + 18 SiO + 30 C → 3 P + 30 CO + 18 CaSiO + 2 CaF</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Side products from this production include ferrophosphorus, a crude form of FeP, resulting from iron impurities in the mineral precursors. The silicate slag is a useful construction material. The fluoride is sometimes recovered for use in water fluoridation. More problematic is a \"mud\" containing significant amounts of white phosphorus. Production of white phosphorus is conducted in large facilities in part because it is energy intensive. The white phosphorus is transported in molten form. Some major accidents have occurred during transportation, train derailments at Brownston, Nebraska and Miamisburg, Ohio led to large fires. The worst incident in recent times was an environmental one in 1968 when the sea became contaminated due to spillages and/or inadequately treated sewage from a white phosphorus plant at Placentia Bay, Newfoundland.</p>\n<p>Another process by which elemental phosphorus is extracted includes applying at high temperatures (1500 °C):</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Ca(PO) + 6 SiO + 10 C → 6CaSiO + 10 CO + P</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Thermphos International is Europe's only producer of elemental phosphorus with the annual capacity of 80,000 t provided by a plant at Vlissingen, the Netherlands.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Phosphorus compounds</div>\n<h3>Oxoacids of phosphorus</h3>\n<p>Phosphorous oxoacids are extensive, often commercially important, and sometimes structurally complicated. They all have acidic protons bound to oxygen atoms and some have nonacidic protons that are bonded directly to phosphorus. Although many oxoacids of phosphorus are formed, only nine are important, and three of them, hypophosphorous acid, phosphorous acid, and phosphoric acid, are particularly important ones.</p>\n\n<h3>Phosphorus(V) compounds</h3>\n<h4>Oxides</h4>\n<p>The most prevalent compounds of phosphorus are derivatives of phosphate (PO), a tetrahedral anion. Phosphate is the conjugate base of phosphoric acid, which is produced on a massive scale for use in fertilisers. Being triprotic, phosphoric acid converts stepwise to three conjugate bases:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>HPO + HO  HO + HPO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>K</i>= 7.25×10</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>HPO + HO  HO + HPO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>K</i>= 6.31×10</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>HPO + HO  HO + &nbsp;PO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>K</i>= 3.98×10</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Phosphate exhibits the tendency to form chains and rings with P-O-P bonds. Many polyphosphates are known, including ATP. Polyphosphates arise by dehydration of hydrogen phosphates such as HPO and HPO. For example, the industrially important trisodium triphosphate (also known as sodium tripolyphosphate, STPP) is produced industrially on a megatonne scale via this condensation reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Na[(HO)PO] + Na[(HO)PO] → Na[OP-O-P(O)-O-PO] + 2 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Phosphorus pentoxide (PO) is the acid anhydride of phosphoric acid, but several intermediates are known between the two. This waxy white solid reacts vigorously with water.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe tetrahedral structure of PO and PS.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>With metal cations, phosphate forms a variety of salts. These solids are polymeric, featuring P-O-M linkages. When the metal cation has a charge of 2+ or 3+, the salts are generally insoluble, hence they exist as common minerals. Many phosphate salts are derived from hydrogen phosphate (HPO).</p>\n<p>PCl and PF are common compounds. Both are volatile and pale or colourless. The other two halides, PBr and PIPI are unstable. The pentachloride and pentafluoride adopt trigonal bipyramid molecular geometry and are Lewis acids. With fluoride, PF forms PF, an anion that is isoelectronic with SF. The most important oxyhalide is phosphorus oxychloride (POCl), which is tetrahedral.</p>\n<p>Before extensive computer calculations were feasible, it was proposed that bonding in phosphorus(V) compounds involved <i>d</i> orbitals. It is now accepted that the bonding can be better explained by molecular orbital theory and involves only s- and p-orbitals on phosphorus.</p>\n<h3>Nitrides</h3>\n<p>Compounds of the formula (PNCl) exist mainly as rings such as the trimer hexachlorophosphazene. The phosphazenes arise by treatment of phosphorus pentachloride with ammonium chloride: PCl + NHCl → 1/<i>n</i> (NPCl) + 4 HCl The chloride groups can be replaced by alkoxide (RO) to give rise to a family of polymers with potentially useful properties.</p>\n<h3>Sulfides</h3>\n<div>Main article: phosphorus sulfide</div>\n<p>Phosphorus forms a wide range of sulfides, where phosphorus can be P(V), P(III) or other oxidation states. Most famous is the three-fold symmetric PS used in strike-anywhere matches. PS and PO have analogous structures.</p>\n<h3>Phosphorus(III) compounds</h3>\n<p>Phosphine (PH) and its organic derivatives (PR) are structural analogues with ammonia (NH) but the bond angles at phosphorus are closer to 90° for phosphine and its organic derivatives. It is an ill-smelling, toxic compound. Phosphine is produced by hydrolysis of calcium phosphide, CaP. Unlike ammonia, phosphine is oxidised by air. Phosphine is also far less basic than ammonia.</p>\n<p>All four symmetrical trihalides are well known: gaseous PF, the yellowish liquids PCl and PBr, and the solid PI. These materials are moisture sensitive, hydrolysing to give phosphorus acid. The trichloride, a common reagent, is produced by chlorination of white phosphorus:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>P + 6 Cl → 4 PCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The trifluoride is produced by from the trichloride by halide exchange. PF is toxic because it binds to haemoglobin.</p>\n<p>Phosphorus(III) oxide, PO (also called tetraphosphorus hexoxide) is the anhydride of P(OH), the minor tautomer of phosphorous acid. The structure of PO is like that of PO less the terminal oxide groups.</p>\n<p>Mixed oxyhalides and oxyhydrides of phosphorus(III) are almost unknown.</p>\n<h3>Organophosphorus compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: organophosphorus compounds</div>\n<p>Compounds with P-C and P-O-C bonds are often classified as organophosphorus compounds. They are widely used commercially. The PCl serves as a source of P in routes to organophosphorus(III) compounds. For example it is the precursor to triphenylphosphine:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>PCl + 6 Na + 3 CHCl → P(CH) + 6 NaCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Treatment of phosphorus trihalides with alcohols and phenols gives phosphites, e.g. triphenylphosphite:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>PCl + 3 CHOH → P(OCH) + 3 HCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Similar reactions occur for phosphorus oxychloride, affording triphenylphosphate:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>OPCl + 3 CHOH → OP(OCH) + 3 HCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Phosphorus(I) and phosphorus(II) compounds</h3>\n<p>These compounds generally feature P-P bonds. Examples include catenated derivatives of phosphine and organophosphines. The highly flammable gas diphosphine (PH) is the first of a series of derivatives of this type. Diphosphine is an analogue of hydrazine. Compounds containing P=P double bonds have also been observed, although they are rare.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA stable diphosphene, a derivative of phosphorus(I).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Phosphides</h3>\n<p>The phosphide ion is P. Phosphides arise by reaction of metals with red phosphorus. Salts of P do not exist in solution and these derivatives are refractory, reflecting their high lattice energy. Illustrated by the behaviour calcium phosphide, many metal phosphides hydrolyse in water with release of phosphine:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>CaP + 6 HO → 2 PH + 3 Ca(OH)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Schreibersite is a naturally occurring phosphide found in meteorites. Many polyphosphides are known such as derivatives of OsP. These can be structurally complex ranging from NaP and derivatives of P. Often these species adopt cage-like structures that resemble fragments of violet phosphorus.</p>\n<h2>Spelling and etymology</h2>\n<p>The name <i>Phosphorus</i> in Ancient Greece was the name for the planet Venus and is derived from the Greek words (φως = light, φέρω = carry), which roughly translates as light-bringer or light carrier. (In Greek mythology and tradition, Augerinus (Αυγερινός = morning star, in use until today), Hesperus or Hesperinus (΄Εσπερος or Εσπερινός or Αποσπερίτης = evening star, in use until today) and Eosphorus (Εωσφόρος = dawnbearer, not in use for the planet after Christianity) are close homologues, and also associated with Phosphorus-the-planet).</p>\n<p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the correct spelling of the element is <b>phosphorus</b>. The word <b>phosphorous</b> is the adjectival form of the P valence: so, just as sulfur forms sulfur<b>ous</b> and sulfur<b>ic</b> compounds, phosphor<b>us</b> forms phosphor<b>ous</b> compounds (e.g., phosphorous acid) and P valence phosphor<b>ic</b> compounds (e.g., phosphoric acids and phosphates).</p>\n<h2>History and discovery</h2>\n<p>Phosphorus was the 13th element to be discovered. For this reason, and also due to its use in explosives, poisons and nerve agents, it is sometimes referred to as \"the Devil's element\". It was the first element to be discovered that was not known since ancient times. The discovery of phosphorus is credited to the German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669, although other chemists might have discovered phosphorus around the same time. Brand experimented with urine, which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism. Working in Hamburg, Brand attempted to create the fabled philosopher's stone through the distillation of some salts by evaporating urine, and in the process produced a white material that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly. It was named <i>phosphorus mirabilis</i> (\"miraculous bearer of light\"). His process originally involved letting urine stand for days until it gave off a terrible smell. Then he boiled it down to a paste, heated this paste to a high temperature, and led the vapours through water, where he hoped they would condense to gold. Instead, he obtained a white, waxy substance that glowed in the dark. Brand had discovered phosphorus, the first element discovered since antiquity. We now know that Brand produced ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate, (NH\n4)NaHPO\n4. While the quantities were essentially correct (it took about 1,100&nbsp;L of urine to make about 60&nbsp;g of phosphorus), it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot. Later scientists would discover that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRobert Boyle</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Brand at first tried to keep the method secret, but later sold the recipe for 200 thalers to D Krafft from Dresden, who could now make it as well, and toured much of Europe with it, including England, where he met with Robert Boyle. The secret that it was made from urine leaked out and first Johann Kunckel (1630–1703) in Sweden (1678) and later Boyle in London (1680) also managed to make phosphorus. Boyle states that Krafft gave him no information as to the preparation of phosphorus other than that it was derived from \"somewhat that belonged to the body of man\". This gave Boyle a valuable clue, however, so that he, too, managed to make phosphorus, and published the method of its manufacture. Later he improved Brand's process by using sand in the reaction (still using urine as base material),</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 NaPO\n3 + 2 SiO\n2 + 10 C → 2 Na\n2SiO\n3 + 10 CO + P\n4</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Robert Boyle was the first to use phosphorus to ignite sulfur-tipped wooden splints, forerunners of our modern matches, in 1680.</p>\n<p>In 1769 Johan Gottlieb Gahn and Carl Wilhelm Scheele showed that calcium phosphate (Ca\n3(PO\n4)\n2) is found in bones, and they obtained elemental phosphorus from bone ash. Antoine Lavoisier recognized phosphorus as an element in 1777. Bone ash was the major source of phosphorus until the 1840s. The method started by roasting bones, then employed the use of clay retorts encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product. Alternately, precipitated phosphates could be made from ground-up bones that had been de-greased and treated with strong acids. white phosphorus could be then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates, mixed with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot, and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a retort. Carbon monoxide and other flammable gases produced during the reduction process were burnt off in a flare stack.</p>\n<p>In the 1840s, world phosphate production turned to the mining of tropical island deposits formed from bird and bat guano (see also Guano Islands Act). These became an important source of phosphates for fertilizer in the latter half of the 19 century.</p>\n<p>Phosphate rock, a mineral containing calcium phosphate, was first used in 1850 to make phosphorus, and following the introduction of the electric arc furnace in 1890, elemental phosphorus production switched from the bone-ash heating, to electric arc production from phosphate rock. After the depletion of world guano sources about the same time, mineral phosphates became the major source of phosphate fertilizer production. Phosphate rock production greatly increased after World War II, and remains the primary global source of phosphorus and phosphorus chemicals today. See the article on peak phosphorus for more information on the history and present state of phosphate mining. Phosphate rock remains a feedstock in the fertilizer industry, where it is treated with sulfuric acid to produce various \"superphosphate\" fertilizer products.</p>\n<p>White phosphorus was first made commercially in the 19 century for the match industry. This used bone ash for a phosphate source, as described above. The bone-ash process became obsolete when the submerged-arc furnace for phosphorus production was introduced to reduce phosphate rock. The electric furnace method allowed production to increase to the point where phosphorus could be used in weapons of war. In World War I it was used in incendiaries, smoke screens and tracer bullets. A special incendiary bullet was developed to shoot at hydrogen-filled Zeppelins over Britain (hydrogen being highly flammable if it can be ignited). During World War II, Molotov cocktails of benzene and phosphorus were distributed in Britain to specially selected civilians within the British resistance operation, for defence; and phosphorus incendiary bombs were used in war on a large scale. Burning phosphorus is difficult to extinguish and if it splashes onto human skin it has horrific effects.</p>\n<p>Early matches used white phosphorus in their composition, which was dangerous due to its toxicity. Murders, suicides and accidental poisonings resulted from its use. (An apocryphal tale tells of a woman attempting to murder her husband with white phosphorus in his food, which was detected by the stew's giving off luminous steam). In addition, exposure to the vapours gave match workers a severe necrosis of the bones of the jaw, the infamous \"phossy jaw\". When a safe process for manufacturing red phosphorus was discovered, with its far lower flammability and toxicity, laws were enacted, under the Berne Convention (1906), requiring its adoption as a safer alternative for match manufacture. The toxicity of white phosphorus led to discontinuation of it use in matches. In a historical coincidence, the Allies used phosphorus incendiary bombs in World War II to destroy Hamburg, the place where the \"miraculous bearer of light\" was first discovered.</p>\n<h3>The glow, the explanation, and the term derived from it</h3>\n<p>It was known from early times that the green glow emanating from white phosphorus would persist for a time in a stoppered jar, but then cease. Robert Boyle in the 1680s ascribed it to \"debilitation\" of the air; in fact, it is oxygen being consumed. By the 18th century, it was known that in pure oxygen, phosphorus does not glow at all; there is only a range of partial pressure at which it does. Heat can be applied to drive the reaction at higher pressures.</p>\n<p>In 1974, the glow was explained by R. J. van Zee and A. U. Khan. A reaction with oxygen takes place at the surface of the solid (or liquid) phosphorus, forming the short-lived molecules HPO and P\n2O\n2 that both emit visible light. The reaction is slow and only very little of the intermediates are required to produce the luminescence, hence the extended time the glow continues in a stoppered jar.</p>\n<p>Since that time, <i>phosphors</i> and <i>phosphorescence</i> were used loosely to describe substances that shine in the dark without burning. However, as mentioned above, even though the term phosphorescence was originally coined as a term by analogy with the glow from oxidation of elemental phosphorus, is now reserved for another fundamentally different process—re-emission of light after illumination.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Fertiliser</h3>\n<p>The dominant application of phosphorus is in fertilisers, which provides phosphate as required for all life and is often a limiting nutrient for crops. Phosphorus, being an essential plant nutrient, finds its major use as a constituent of fertilizers for agriculture and farm production in the form of concentrated phosphoric acids, which can consist of 70% to 75% PO. Global demand for fertilisers led to large increase in phosphate (PO) production in the second half of the 20th century. Due to the essential nature of phosphorus to living organisms, the low solubility of natural phosphorus-containing compounds, and the slow natural cycle of phosphorus, the agricultural industry relies on fertilisers that contain phosphate. A major form of these fertilisers is superphosphate of lime, a mixture of two salts, calcium dihydrogen phosphate Ca(HPO) and calcium sulfate dihydrate CaSO·2HO, produced by the reaction of sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate.</p>\n\n<h3>Organophosphorus compounds</h3>\n<p>White phosphorus is widely used to make organophosphorus compounds, through the intermediates phosphorus chlorides and two phosphorus sulfides, phosphorus pentasulfide, and phosphorus sesquisulfide. Organophosphorus compounds have many applications, including in plasticizers, flame retardants, pesticides, extraction agents, and water treatment. in particular the herbicide glyphosate sold under the brand name Roundup.</p>\n<h3>Metallurgical aspects</h3>\n<p>Phosphorus is also an important component in steel production, in the making of phosphor bronze, and in many other related products. Phosphorus is added to metallic copper during its smelting process to react with oxygen present as an impurity in copper and to produce phosphorus-containing copper (CuOFP) alloys with a higher hydrogen embrittlement resistance than normal copper.</p>\n<h3>Matches</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMatch striking surface made of a mixture of red phosphorus, glue and ground glass. The glass powder is used to increase the friction.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Match</div>\n<p>Phosphorus-contained matches were first produced in 1830s and contained a mixture of white phosphorus, an oxygen-releasing compound (potassium chlorate, lead dioxide or some nitrate) and a binder in their heads. They were rather sensitive to storage conditions, toxic and unsafe, as they could be lit by striking on any rough surface. Therefore, their production was gradually banned between 1872 and 1925 in different countries. The international Berne Convention, adopted in 1906, prohibited the use of white phosphorus in matches. As a consequence, the 'strike-anywhere' matches were gradually replaced by 'safety matches' where white phosphorus was substituted by phosphorus sesquisulfide (PS), sulfur or antimony sulfide. Such matches are hard to ignite on an arbitrary surface and require a special strip. The strip contains red phosphorus which heats up upon striking, reacts with the oxygen-releasing compound in the head and ignites the flammable material of the head.</p>\n<h3>Water softening</h3>\n<p>Sodium tripolyphosphate made from phosphoric acid is used in laundry detergents in some countries, but banned for this use in others. It is useful for softening water to enhance the performance of the detergents and to prevent pipe/boiler tube corrosion.</p>\n<h3>Niche applications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Phosphates are utilized in the making of special glasses that are used for sodium lamps.</li>\n<li>Bone-ash, calcium phosphate, is used in the production of fine china.</li>\n<li>Phosphoric acid made from elemental phosphorus is used in food applications such as some soda beverages. The acid is also a starting point to make food grade phosphates. These include mono-calcium phosphate that is employed in baking powder and sodium tripolyphosphate and other sodium phosphates. Among other uses these are used to improve the characteristics of processed meat and cheese. Others are used in toothpaste.</li>\n<li>White phosphorus, called \"WP\" (slang term \"Willie Peter\") is used in military applications as incendiary bombs, for smoke-screening as smoke pots and smoke bombs, and in tracer ammunition. It is also a part of an obsolete M34 White Phosphorus US hand grenade. This multipurpose grenade was mostly used for signalling, smoke screens and inflammation; it could also cause severe burns and had a psychological impact on the enemy. Military uses of white phosphorus are constrained by international law</li>\n<li>In trace amounts, phosphorus is used as a dopant for n-type semiconductors.</li>\n<li>P and P are used as radioactive tracers in biochemical laboratories.</li>\n<li>Phosphate is a strong complexing agent for the hexavalent uranyl (UO) species and this is the reason why apatite and other natural phosphates can often be very rich in uranium.</li>\n<li>Tributylphosphate is an organophosphate soluble in kerosene and used to extract uranium in the Purex process applied in the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Inorganic phosphorus in the form of the phosphate PO3−\n4 is required for all known forms of life, playing a major role in biological molecules such as DNA and RNA where it forms part of the structural framework of these molecules. Living cells also use phosphate to transport cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Nearly every cellular process that uses energy obtains it in the form of ATP. ATP is also important for phosphorylation, a key regulatory event in cells. Phospholipids are the main structural components of all cellular membranes. Calcium phosphate salts assist in stiffening bones.</p>\n<p>Living cells are defined by a membrane that separates it from its surroundings. Biological membranes are made from a phospholipid matrix and proteins, typically in the form of a bilayer. Phospholipids are derived from glycerol, such that two of the glycerol hydroxyl (OH) protons have been replaced with fatty acids as an ester, and the third hydroxyl proton has been replaced with phosphate bonded to another alcohol.</p>\n<p>An average adult human contains about 0.7&nbsp;kg of phosphorus, about 85–90% of which is present in bones and teeth in the form of apatite, and the remainder in soft tissues and extracellular fluids (~1%). The phosphorus content increases from about 0.5 weight% in infancy to 0.65–1.1 weight% in adults. Average phosphorus concentration in the blood is about 0.4 g/L, about 70% of that is organic and 30% inorganic phosphates. A well-fed adult in the industrialized world consumes and excretes about 1–3&nbsp;grams of phosphorus per day, with consumption in the form of inorganic phosphate and phosphorus-containing biomolecules such as nucleic acids and phospholipids; and excretion almost exclusively in the form of phosphate ions such as H\n2PO−\n4 and HPO2−\n4. Only about 0.1% of body phosphate circulates in the blood, and this amount reflects the amount of phosphate available to soft tissue cells.</p>\n<h3>Bone and teeth enamel</h3>\n<p>The main component of bone is hydroxyapatite as well as amorphous forms of calcium phosphate, possibly including carbonate. Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel. Water fluoridation enhances the resistance of teeth to decay by the partial conversion of this mineral to the still harder material called fluoroapatite:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Ca\n5(PO\n4)\n3OH + F− → Ca\n5(PO\n4)\n3F + OH−</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Phosphorus deficiency</h3>\n<p>In medicine, low-phosphate syndromes are caused by malnutrition, by failure to absorb phosphate, and by metabolic syndromes that draw phosphate from the blood (such as re-feeding after malnutrition) or pass too much of it into the urine. All are characterized by hypophosphatemia, which is a condition of low levels of soluble phosphate levels in the blood serum, and therefore inside cells. Symptoms of hypophosphatemia include muscle and neurological dysfunction, and disruption of muscle and blood cells due to lack of ATP. Too much phosphate can lead to diarrhoea and calcification (hardening) of organs and soft tissue, and can interfere with the body's ability to use iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc.</p>\n<p>Phosphorus is an essential macromineral for plants, which is studied extensively in edaphology in order to understand plant uptake from soil systems. In ecological terms, phosphorus is often a limiting factor in many environments; i.e. the availability of phosphorus governs the rate of growth of many organisms. In ecosystems an excess of phosphorus can be problematic, especially in aquatic systems, resulting in eutrophication which sometimes lead to algal blooms.</p>\n<h3>Food sources</h3>\n<p>The main food sources for phosphorus are foods containing protein, although proteins do not contain phosphorus. For example, milk, meat, and soya typically also have phosphorus. As a rule, if one holds a meal plan providing sufficient amount of protein and calcium then the amount of phosphorus is also likely sufficient.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Organic compounds of phosphorus form a wide class of materials, many are required for life, but some are extremely toxic. Fluorophosphate esters are among the most potent neurotoxins known. A wide range of organophosphorus compounds are used for their toxicity to certain organisms as pesticides (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, etc.) and weaponised as nerve agents. Most inorganic phosphates are relatively nontoxic and essential nutrients.</p>\n<p>The white phosphorus allotrope presents a significant hazard because it ignites in air and produces phosphoric acid residue. Chronic white phosphorus poisoning leads to necrosis of the jaw called \"phossy jaw\". Ingestion of white phosphorus may cause a medical condition known as \"Smoking Stool Syndrome\".</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPhosphorus explosion</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Upon exposure to elemental phosphorus, in the past it was suggested to wash the affected area with 2% copper sulfate solution to form harmless compounds that can be washed away. According to the recent <i>US Navy's Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties and Conventional Military Chemical Injuries: FM8-285: Part 2 Conventional Military Chemical Injuries</i>, \"Cupric (copper(II)) sulfate has been used by U.S. personnel in the past and is still being used by some nations. However, copper sulfate is toxic and its use will be discontinued. Copper sulfate may produce kidney and cerebral toxicity as well as intravascular hemolysis.\"</p>\n<p>The manual suggests instead \"<i>a bicarbonate solution to neutralize phosphoric acid, which will then allow removal of visible white phosphorus. Particles often can be located by their emission of smoke when air strikes them, or by their phosphorescence in the dark. In dark surroundings, fragments are seen as luminescent spots. Promptly debride the burn if the patient's condition will permit removal of bits of WP (white phosphorus) that might be absorbed later and possibly produce systemic poisoning. DO NOT apply oily-based ointments until it is certain that all WP has been removed. Following complete removal of the particles, treat the lesions as thermal burns.</i>\" As white phosphorus readily mixes with oils, any oily substances or ointments are not recommended until the area is thoroughly cleaned and all white phosphorus removed.</p>\n<h3>US DEA List I status</h3>\n<p>Phosphorus can reduce elemental iodine to hydroiodic acid, which is a reagent effective for reducing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. For this reason, red and white phosphorus were designated by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration as List I precursor chemicals under 21 CFR 1310.02 effective on November 17, 2001. As a result, in the United States, handlers of red or white phosphorus are subject to stringent regulatory controls.</p>\n"

  "title": "Sulfur",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Sulfur (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Sulfur</b> or <b>sulphur</b> (British English; see spelling below) is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>S</b> and atomic number&nbsp;16. It is an abundant, multivalent non-metal. Under normal conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with chemical formula S. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow crystalline solid when at room temperature. Chemically, sulfur can react as either an oxidant or reducing agent. It oxidizes most metals and several nonmetals, including carbon, which leads to its negative charge in most organosulfur compounds, but it reduces several strong oxidants, such as oxygen and fluorine.</p>\n<p>Sulfur occurs naturally as the pure element (native sulfur) and as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Elemental sulfur crystals are commonly sought after by mineral collectors for their distinct, brightly colored polyhedron shapes. Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, mentioned for its uses in ancient India, ancient Greece, China and Egypt. Fumes from burning sulfur were used as fumigants, and sulfur-containing medicinal mixtures were used as balms and antiparasitics. Sulfur is referred to in the Bible as <i>brimstone</i> (burn stone) in English, with this name still used in several nonscientific tomes. It was needed to make the best quality of black gunpowder. In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was a basic element, rather than a compound.</p>\n<p>Elemental sulfur was once extracted from salt domes where it sometimes occurs in nearly pure form, but this method has been obsolete since the late 20th century. Today, almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum. The element's commercial uses are primarily in fertilizers, because of the relatively high requirement of plants for it, and in the manufacture of sulfuric acid, a primary industrial chemical. Other well-known uses for the element are in matches, insecticides and fungicides. Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous, and the smell of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, grapefruit, and garlic is due to sulfur compounds. Hydrogen sulfide produced by living organisms imparts the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other biological processes.</p>\n<p>Sulfur is an essential element for all life, and is widely used in biochemical processes. In metabolic reactions, sulfur compounds serve as both fuels (electron donors) and respiratory (oxygen-alternative) materials (electron acceptors). Sulfur in organic form is present in the vitamins biotin and thiamine, the latter being named for the Greek word for sulfur. Sulfur is an important part of many enzymes and in antioxidant molecules like glutathione and thioredoxin. Organically bonded sulfur is a component of all proteins, as the amino acids cysteine and methionine. Disulfide bonds are largely responsible for the mechanical strength and insolubility of the protein keratin, found in outer skin, hair, and feathers, and the element contributes to their pungent odor when burned.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWhen burned, sulfur melts to a blood-red liquid and emits a blue flame that is best observed in the dark.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Sulfur forms polyatomic molecules with different chemical formulas, with the best-known allotrope being octasulfur, cyclo-S. Octasulfur is a soft, bright-yellow solid with only a faint odor, similar to that of matches. It melts at 115.21 °C, boils at 444.6 °C and sublimes easily. At 95.2 °C, below its melting temperature, cyclo-octasulfur changes from α-octasulfur to the β-polymorph. The structure of the S ring is virtually unchanged by this phase change, which affects the intermolecular interactions. Between its melting and boiling temperatures, octasulfur changes its allotrope again, turning from β-octasulfur to γ-sulfur, again accompanied by a lower density but increased viscosity due to the formation of polymers. At even higher temperatures, however, the viscosity decreases as depolymerization occurs. Molten sulfur assumes a dark red color above 200 °C. The density of sulfur is about 2 g·cm, depending on the allotrope; all of its stable allotropes are excellent electrical insulators.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Sulfur burns with a blue flame concomitant with formation of sulfur dioxide, notable for its peculiar suffocating odor. Sulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide and, to a lesser extent, in other nonpolar organic solvents, such as benzene and toluene. The first and the second ionization energies of sulfur are 999.6 and 2252 kJ·mol, respectively. Despite such figures, the +2 oxidation state is rare, with +4 and +6 being more common. The fourth and sixth ionization energies are 4556 and 8495.8 kJ·mol, the magnitude of the figures caused by electron transfer between orbitals; these states are only stable with strong oxidants as fluorine, oxygen, and chlorine.</p>\n<h3>Allotropes</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe structure of the cyclooctasulfur molecule, S.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Allotropes of sulfur</div>\n<p>Sulfur forms over 30 solid allotropes, more than any other element. Besides S, several other rings are known. Removing one atom from the crown gives S, which is more deeply yellow than S. HPLC analysis of \"elemental sulfur\" reveals an equilibrium mixture of mainly S, but with S and small amounts of S. Larger rings have been prepared, including S and S.</p>\n<p>Amorphous or \"plastic\" sulfur is produced by rapid cooling of molten sulfur—for example, by pouring it into cold water. X-ray crystallography studies show that the amorphous form may have a helical structure with eight atoms per turn. The long coiled polymeric molecules make the brownish substance elastic, and in bulk this form has the feel of crude rubber. This form is metastable at room temperature and gradually reverts to crystalline molecular allotrope, which is no longer elastic. This process happens within a matter of hours to days, but can be rapidly catalyzed.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of sulfur</div>\n<p>Sulfur has 25 known isotopes, four of which are stable: S (95.02%), S (0.75%), S (4.21%), and S (0.02%). Other than S, with a half-life of 87 days and formed in cosmic ray spallation of Ar, the radioactive isotopes of sulfur have half-lives less than <abbr>170 minutes</abbr>.</p>\n<p>When sulfide minerals are precipitated, isotopic equilibration among solids and liquid may cause small differences in the δS-34 values of co-genetic minerals. The differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration. The δC-13 and δS-34 of coexisting carbonate minerals and sulfides can be used to determine the pH and oxygen fugacity of the ore-bearing fluid during ore formation.</p>\n<p>In most forest ecosystems, sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere; weathering of ore minerals and evaporites contribute some sulfur. Sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources, and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in hydrologic studies. Differences in the natural abundances can be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the S of ecosystem components. Rocky Mountain lakes thought to be dominated by atmospheric sources of sulfate have been found to have different δS values from lakes believed to be dominated by watershed sources of sulfate.</p>\n<h3>Natural occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMost of the yellow and orange hues of Io are due to elemental sulfur and sulfur compounds, produced by active volcanoes.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNative sulfur crystals</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA man carrying sulfur blocks from Kawah Ijen, a volcano in East Java, Indonesia, 2009</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>S is created inside massive stars, at a depth where the temperature exceeds 2.5×10&nbsp;K, by the fusion of one nucleus of silicon plus one nucleus of helium. As this is part of the alpha process that produces elements in abundance, sulfur is the 10th most common element in the universe.</p>\n<p>Sulfur, usually as sulfide, is present in many types of meteorites. Ordinary chondrites contain on average 2.1% sulfur, and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as 6.6%. It is normally present as troilite (FeS), but there are exceptions, with carbonaceous chondrites containing free sulfur, sulfates and other sulfur compounds. The distinctive colors of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io are attributed to various forms of molten, solid and gaseous sulfur.</p>\n<p>On Earth, elemental sulfur can be found near hot springs and volcanic regions in many parts of the world, especially along the Pacific Ring of Fire; such volcanic deposits are currently mined in Indonesia, Chile, and Japan. Such deposits are polycrystalline, with the largest documented single crystal measuring 22×16×11&nbsp;cm. Historically, Sicily was a large source of sulfur in the Industrial Revolution.</p>\n<p>Significant deposits of elemental sulfur, believed to have been (and are still being) synthesised by anaerobic bacteria on sulfate minerals like gypsum, exist in salt domes along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and in evaporites in eastern Europe and western Asia. Native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone. Fossil-based sulfur deposits from salt domes have until recently been the basis for commercial production in the United States, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. Currently, commercial production is still carried out in the Osiek mine in Poland. Such sources are now of secondary commercial importance, and most are no longer worked.</p>\n<p>Common naturally occurring sulfur compounds include the sulfide minerals, such as pyrite (iron sulfide), cinnabar (mercury sulfide), galena (lead sulfide), sphalerite (zinc sulfide) and stibnite (antimony sulfide); and the sulfates, such as gypsum (calcium sulfate), alunite (potassium aluminium sulfate), and barite (barium sulfate). On Earth, just as upon Jupiter's moon Io, elemental sulfur occurs naturally in volcanic emissions, including emissions from hydrothermal vents.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Sulfur may be found by itself and historically was usually obtained in this way, while pyrite has been a source of sulfur via sulfuric acid. In volcanic regions in Sicily, in ancient times, it was found on the surface of the Earth, and the <i>\"Sicilian process\"</i> was used: sulfur deposits were piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides, with airspaces between them. Then, some sulfur was pulverized, spread over the stacked ore and ignited, causing the free sulfur to melt down the hills. Eventually the surface-borne deposits played out, and miners excavated veins that ultimately dotted the Sicilian landscape with labyrinthine mines. Mining was unmechanized and labor-intensive, with pickmen freeing the ore from the rock, and mine-boys or <i>carusi</i> carrying baskets of ore to the surface, often through a mile or more of tunnels. Once the ore was at the surface, it was reduced and extracted in smelting ovens. The conditions in Sicilian sulfur mines were horrific, prompting Booker T. Washington to write <i>\"I am not prepared just now to say to what extent I believe in a physical hell in the next world, but a sulphur mine in Sicily is about the nearest thing to hell that I expect to see in this life.\"</i>. The plight of the <i>carusi</i> is a secondary theme in the historical novella <i>The Lady of the Wheel</i>, by Angelo F. Coniglio.</p>\n<p>Today's sulfur production is as a side product of other industrial processes such as oil refining; in these processes, sulfur often occurs as undesired or detrimental compounds that are extracted and converted to elemental sulfur. As a mineral, native sulfur under salt domes is thought to be a fossil mineral resource, produced by the action of ancient bacteria on sulfate deposits. It was removed from such salt-dome mines mainly by the Frasch process. In this method, superheated water was pumped into a native sulfur deposit to melt the sulfur, and then compressed air returned the 99.5% pure melted product to the surface. Throughout the 20th century this procedure produced elemental sulfur that required no further purification. However, due to a limited number of such sulfur deposits and the high cost of working them, this process for mining sulfur has not been employed in a major way anywhere in the world since 2002.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSulfur recovered from hydrocarbons in Alberta, stockpiled for shipment in North Vancouver, B.C.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Today, sulfur is produced from petroleum, natural gas, and related fossil resources, from which it is obtained mainly as hydrogen sulfide. Organosulfur compounds, undesirable impurities in petroleum, may be upgraded by subjecting them to hydrodesulfurization, which cleaves the C–S bonds:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>R-S-R + 2 H → 2 RH + HS</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The resulting hydrogen sulfide from this process, and also as it occurs in natural gas, is converted into elemental sulfur by the Claus process. This process entails oxidation of some hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide and then the comproportionation of the two:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 O + 2 HS → 2 SO + 2 HO</dd>\n<dd>SO + 2 HS → 3 S + 2 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nProduction and price (US market) of elemental sulfur</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Owing to the high sulfur content of the Athabasca Oil Sands, stockpiles of elemental sulfur from this process now exist throughout Alberta, Canada. Another way of storing sulfur is as a binder for concrete, the resulting product having many desirable properties.</p>\n<p>The world production of sulfur in 2011 amounted to 69 million tonnes (Mt), with more than 15 countries contributing more than 1 Mt each. Countries producing more than 5 Mt are China (9.6), US (8.8), Canada (7.1) and Russia (7.1). While the production has been slowly increasing from 1900 to 2010, the price was much less stable, especially in the 1980s and around 2010.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Sulfur compounds</div>\n<p>Common oxidation states of sulfur range from −2 to +6. Sulfur forms stable compounds with all elements except the noble gases.</p>\n<h3>Sulfides</h3>\n<p>Treatment of sulfur with hydrogen gives hydrogen sulfide. When dissolved in water, hydrogen sulfide is mildly acidic:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>HS  HS + H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Hydrogen sulfide gas and the hydrosulfide anion are extremely toxic to mammals, due to their inhibition of the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and certain cytochromes in a manner analogous to cyanide and azide (see below, under <i>precautions</i>).</p>\n<p>Reduction of elemental sulfur gives polysulfides, which consist of chains of sulfur atoms terminated with S centers:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Na + S → NaS</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction highlights arguably the single most distinctive property of sulfur: its ability to catenate (bind to itself by formation of chains). Protonation of these polysulfide anions gives the polysulfanes, HS where x = 2, 3, and 4. Ultimately reduction of sulfur gives sulfide salts:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>16 Na + S → 8 NaS</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The interconversion of these species is exploited in the sodium-sulfur battery. The radical anion S gives the blue color of the mineral lapis lazuli.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLapis lazuli owes its blue color to a sulfur radical.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>With very strong oxidants, S can be oxidized, for example, to give bicyclic S.</p>\n<h3>Oxides and oxyanions</h3>\n<p>The principal sulfur oxides are obtained by burning sulfur:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>S + O → SO</dd>\n<dd>2 SO + O → 2 SO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Other oxides are known, e.g. sulfur monoxide and disulfur mono- and dioxides, but they are unstable.</p>\n<p>The sulfur oxides form numerous oxyanions with the formula SO. Sulfur dioxide and sulfites (SO2−\n3) are related to the unstable sulfurous acid (HSO). Sulfur trioxide and sulfates (SO2−\n4) are related to sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid and SO combine to give oleum, a solution of pyrosulfuric acid (HSO) in sulfuric acid.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPeroxydisulfuric acid</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Peroxides convert sulfur into unstable such as SO, a sulfoxide. Peroxymonosulfuric acid (HSO) and peroxydisulfuric acids (HSO), made from the action of SO on concentrated HO, and HSO on concentrated HO respectively.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe sulfate anion, SO2−\n4</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Thiosulfate salts (S\n2O2−\n3), sometimes referred as \"hyposulfites\", used in photographic fixing (HYPO) and as reducing agents, feature sulfur in two oxidation states. Sodium dithionite, (S\n2O2−\n4), contains the more highly reducing dithionite anion. Sodium dithionate (NaSO) is the first member of the polythionic acids (HSO), where <i>n</i> can range from 3 to many.</p>\n<h3>Halides and oxyhalides</h3>\n<p>The two main sulfur fluorides are sulfur hexafluoride, a dense gas used as nonreactive and nontoxic propellant, and sulfur tetrafluoride, a rarely used organic reagent that is highly toxic. Their chlorinated analogs are sulfur dichloride and sulfur monochloride. Sulfuryl chloride and chlorosulfuric acid are derivatives of sulfuric acid; thionyl chloride (SOCl) is a common reagent in organic synthesis.</p>\n<h3>Pnictides</h3>\n<p>An important S–N compound is the cage tetrasulfur tetranitride (SN). Heating this compound gives polymeric sulfur nitride ((SN)), which has metallic properties even though it does not contain any metal atoms. Thiocyanates contain the SCN group. Oxidation of thiocyanate gives thiocyanogen, (SCN) with the connectivity NCS-SCN. Phosphorus sulfides are numerous, the most important commercially being the cages PS and PS.</p>\n<h3>Metal sulfides</h3>\n<div>Main article: Sulfide mineral</div>\n<p>The principal ores of copper, zinc, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, and other metals are sulfides. These materials tend to be dark-colored semiconductors that are not readily attacked by water or even many acids. They are formed, both geochemically and in the laboratory, by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with metal salts. The mineral galena (PbS) was the first demonstrated semiconductor and found a use as a signal rectifier in the cat's whiskers of early crystal radios. The iron sulfide called pyrite, the so-called \"fool's gold,\" has the formula FeS. The upgrading of these ores, usually by roasting, is costly and environmentally hazardous. Sulfur corrodes many metals via the process called tarnishing.</p>\n<h3>Organic compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organosulfur compounds</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Illustrative organosulfur compounds</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Allicin, the active ingredient in garlic</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>R-cysteine, an amino acid containing a thiol group</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Methionine, an amino acid containing a thioether</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Diphenyl disulfide, a representative disulfide</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, a controversial surfactant</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Dibenzothiophene, a component of crude oil</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Penicillin</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the main classes of sulfur-containing organic compounds include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thiols or mercaptans (as they are <b>mer</b>cury <b>capt</b>urers as chelators) are the sulfur analogs of alcohols; treatment of thiols with base gives thiolate ions.</li>\n<li>Thioethers are the sulfur analogs of ethers.</li>\n<li>Sulfonium ions have three groups attached to a cationic sulfur center. Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is one such compound, important in the marine organic sulfur cycle.</li>\n<li>Sulfoxides and sulfones are thioethers with one and two oxygen atoms attached to the sulfur atom, respectively. The simplest sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfoxide, is a common solvent; a common sulfone is sulfolane.</li>\n<li>Sulfonic acids are used in many detergents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compounds with carbon–sulfur bonds are uncommon with the notable exception of carbon disulfide, a volatile colorless liquid that is structurally similar to carbon dioxide. It is used as a reagent to make the polymer rayon and many organosulfur compounds. Unlike carbon monoxide, carbon monosulfide is only stable as a dilute gas, as in the interstellar medium.</p>\n<p>Organosulfur compounds are responsible for the some of the unpleasant odors of decaying organic matter. They are used in the odoration of natural gas and cause the odor of garlic and skunk spray. Not all organic sulfur compounds smell unpleasant at all concentrations: the sulfur-containing monoterpenoid grapefruit mercaptan in small concentrations is responsible for the characteristic scent of grapefruit, but has a generic thiol odor at larger concentrations. Sulfur mustard, a potent vesicant, was used in World War I as a disabling agent.</p>\n<p>Sulfur-sulfur bonds are a structural component to stiffen rubber, in a way similar to the biological role of disulfide bridges to rigidify proteins (see biological below). In the most common type of industrial \"curing\" or hardening and strengthening of natural rubber, elemental sulfur is heated with the rubber to the point that chemical reactions form disulfide bridges between isoprene units of the polymer. This process, patented in 1843, allowed rubber to become a major industrial product, especially automobile tires. Because of the heat and sulfur, the process was named vulcanization, after the Roman god of the forge and volcanism.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Antiquity</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPharmaceutical container for sulfur from the first half of the 20th century. From the Museo del Objeto del Objeto collection</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Being abundantly available in native form, sulfur (Latin <i>sulphur</i>) was known in ancient times and is referred to in the Torah (Genesis). English translations of the Bible commonly referred to burning sulfur as \"brimstone\", giving rise to the name of 'fire-and-brimstone' sermons, in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that await the unbelieving and unrepentant. It is from this part of the Bible that Hell is implied to \"smell of sulfur\" (likely due to its association with volcanic activity). According to the Ebers Papyrus, a sulfur ointment was used in ancient Egypt to treat granular eyelids. Sulfur was used for fumigation in preclassical Greece; this is mentioned in the <i>Odyssey</i>. Pliny the Elder discusses sulfur in book 35 of his <i>Natural History</i>, saying that its best-known source is the island of Melos. He mentions its use for fumigation, medicine, and bleaching cloth.</p>\n<p>A natural form of sulfur known as <i>shiliuhuang</i> was known in China since the 6th century BC and found in Hanzhong. By the 3rd century, the Chinese discovered that sulfur could be extracted from pyrite. Chinese Daoists were interested in sulfur's flammability and its reactivity with certain metals, yet its earliest practical uses were found in traditional Chinese medicine. A Song Dynasty military treatise of 1044 AD described different formulas for Chinese black powder, which is a mixture of potassium nitrate (KNO\n3), charcoal, and sulfur.</p>\n<p>Indian alchemists, practitioners of \"the science of mercury\" (Skt. rasaśāstra, रसशास्त्र), wrote extensively about the use of sulfur in alchemical operations with mercury, from the eighth century AD onwards. In the rasaśāstra tradition, sulphur is called \"the smelly,\" (Skt. gandhaka, गन्धक).</p>\n<p>Early European alchemists gave sulfur its own alchemical symbol, a triangle at the top of a cross. In traditional skin treatment before the modern era of scientific medicine, elemental sulfur was used, mainly in creams, to alleviate conditions such as scabies, ringworm, psoriasis, eczema, and acne. The mechanism of action is unknown—though elemental sulfur does oxidize slowly to sulfurous acid, which in turn (through the action of sulfite) acts as a mild reducing and antibacterial agent.</p>\n<h3>Modern times</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSicilian kiln used to obtain sulfur from volcanic rock.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was an element, not a compound. With the sulfur from Sicily being principally controlled by the French market, a debate ensued about the amount of sulfur France and Britain got. This led to a bloodless confrontation between the two sides in 1840. In 1867, sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in Louisiana and Texas. The highly successful Frasch process was developed to extract this resource.</p>\n<p>In the late 18th century, furniture makers used molten sulfur to produce decorative inlays in their craft. Because of the sulfur dioxide produced during the process of melting sulfur, the craft of sulfur inlays was soon abandoned. Molten sulfur is sometimes still used for setting steel bolts into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floor-mounted equipment attachment points. Pure powdered sulfur was used as a medicinal tonic and laxative. With the advent of the contact process, the majority of sulfur today is used to make sulfuric acid for a wide range of uses, particularly fertilizer.</p>\n<h3>Spelling and etymology</h3>\n<p><i>Sulfur</i> comes via Old French from Latin <i>sulphur</i>, which in turn is apparently formed on a root meaning \"to burn\". The element was traditionally spelled <i>sulphur</i> in the United Kingdom (since the 14th century), most of the rest of the Commonwealth (including Australia, India, Malaysia, South Africa), Hong Kong, the Caribbean and Ireland. <i>Sulfur</i> is used in the United States, while both spellings are used in Canada and the Philippines.</p>\n<p>However, the IUPAC adopted the spelling <i>sulfur</i> in 1990, as did the Royal Society of Chemistry Nomenclature Committee in 1992. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority for England and Wales recommended its use in 2000, and it now appears in GCSE exams. The Oxford Dictionaries note that <i>\"In chemistry... the -f- spelling is now the standard form in all related words in the field in both British and US contexts.\"</i></p>\n<p>In Latin, the word is variously written <i>sulpur</i>, <i>sulphur</i>, and <i>sulfur</i> (the Oxford Latin Dictionary lists the spellings in this order). It is an original Latin name and not a Classical Greek loan, so the <i>ph</i> variant does not denote the Greek letter φ (phi). Sulfur in Greek is <i>thion</i> (θείον), whence comes the prefix thio-. The simplification of the Latin word's p or ph to an f appears to have taken place towards the end of the classical period.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Sulfuric acid</h3>\n<p>Elemental sulfur is mainly used as a precursor to other chemicals. Approximately 85% (1989) is converted to sulfuric acid (HSO):</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 S + 3 O + 2 HO → 2 HSO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>With sulfuric acid being of central importance to the world's economies, its production and consumption is an indicator of a nation's industrial development. For example with 32.5 million tonnes in 2010, the United States produces more sulfuric acid every year than any other inorganic industrial chemical. The principal use for the acid is the extraction of phosphate ores for the production of fertilizer manufacturing. Other applications of sulfuric acid include oil refining, wastewater processing, and mineral extraction.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSulfuric acid production in 2000</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Other large-scale sulfur chemicals</h3>\n<p>Sulfur reacts directly with methane to give carbon disulfide, which is used to manufacture cellophane and rayon. One of the direct uses of sulfur is in vulcanization of rubber, where polysulfides crosslink organic polymers. Sulfites are heavily used to bleach paper and as preservatives in dried fruit. Many surfactants and detergents, e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate, are produced are sulfate derivatives. Calcium sulfate, gypsum, (CaSO2HO) is mined on the scale of 100 million tons each year for use in Portland cement and fertilizers.</p>\n<p>When silver-based photography was widespread, sodium and ammonium thiosulfate were widely used as \"fixing agents.\" Sulfur is a component of gunpowder.</p>\n<h3>Fertilizer</h3>\n<p>Sulfur is increasingly used as a component of fertilizers. The most important form of sulfur for fertilizer is the mineral calcium sulfate. Elemental sulfur is hydrophobic (that is, it is not soluble in water) and, therefore, cannot be directly utilized by plants. Over time, soil bacteria can convert it to soluble derivatives, which can then be utilized by plants. Sulfur improves the use efficiency of other essential plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. Biologically produced sulfur particles are naturally hydrophilic due to a biopolymer coating. This sulfur is, therefore, easier to disperse over the land (via spraying as a diluted slurry), and results in a faster release.</p>\n<p>Plant requirements for sulfur are equal to or exceed those for phosphorus. It is one of the major nutrients essential for plant growth, root nodule formation of legumes and plants protection mechanisms. Sulfur deficiency has become widespread in many countries in Europe. Because atmospheric inputs of sulfur continue to decrease, the deficit in the sulfur input/output is likely to increase, unless sulfur fertilizers are used.</p>\n<h3>Fine chemicals</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA molecular model of the pesticide malathion.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Organosulfur compounds are used in pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs, and agrochemicals. Many drugs contain sulfur, early examples being antibacterial sulfonamides, known as <i>sulfa drugs</i>. Sulfur is a part of many bacterial defense molecules. Most β-lactam antibiotics, including the penicillins, cephalosporins and monolactams contain sulfur.</p>\n<p>Magnesium sulfate, known as Epsom salts when in hydrated crystal form, can be used as a laxative, a bath additive, an exfoliant, magnesium supplement for plants, or (when in dehydrated form) as a desiccant.</p>\n<h3>Fungicide and pesticide</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSulfur candle originally sold for home fumigation</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Elemental sulfur is one of the oldest fungicides and pesticides. \"Dusting sulfur,\" elemental sulfur in powdered form, is a common fungicide for grapes, strawberry, many vegetables and several other crops. It has a good efficacy against a wide range of powdery mildew diseases as well as black spot. In organic production, sulfur is the most important fungicide. It is the only fungicide used in organically farmed apple production against the main disease apple scab under colder conditions. Biosulfur (biologically produced elemental sulfur with hydrophilic characteristics) can be used well for these applications.</p>\n<p>Standard-formulation dusting sulfur is applied to crops with a sulfur duster or from a dusting plane. Wettable sulfur is the commercial name for dusting sulfur formulated with additional ingredients to make it water miscible. It has similar applications and is used as a fungicide against mildew and other mold-related problems with plants and soil.</p>\n<p>Elemental sulfur powder is used as an \"organic\" (i.e. \"green\") insecticide (actually an acaricide) against ticks and mites. A common method of use is to dust clothing or limbs with sulfur powder.</p>\n<p>Diluted solutions of lime sulfur (made by combinding calcium hydroxide with elemental sulfur in water), are used as a dip for pets to destroy ringworm (fungus), mange and other dermatoses and parasites. Sulfur candles consist of almost pure sulfur in blocks or pellets that are burned to fumigate structures. It is no longer used in the home due to the toxicity of the products of combustion.</p>\n<h3>Bacteriocide in winemaking and food preservation</h3>\n<p>Small amounts of sulfur dioxide gas addition (or equivalent potassium metabisulfite addition) to fermented wine to produce traces of sulfurous acid (produced when SO reacts with water) and its sulfite salts in the mixture, has been called \"the most powerful tool in winemaking.\" After the yeast-fermentation stage in winemaking, sulfites absorb oxygen and inhibit aerobic bacterial growth that otherwise would turn ethanol into acetic acid, souring the wine. Without this preservative step, indefinite refrigeration of the product before consumption is usually required. Similar methods go back into antiquity but modern historical mentions of the practice go to the fifteenth century. The practice is used by large industrial wine producers and small organic wine producers alike.</p>\n<p>Sulfur dioxide and various sulfites have been used for their antioxidant antibacterial preservative properties in many other parts of the food industry also. The practice has declined since reports of an allergy-like reaction of some persons to sulfites in foods.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<h3>Protein and organic cofactors</h3>\n<p>Sulfur is an essential component of all living cells. It is the seventh or eighth most abundant element in the human body by weight, being about as common as potassium, and a little more common than sodium or chlorine. A 70&nbsp;kg human body contains about 140&nbsp;grams of sulfur.</p>\n<p>In plants and animals, the amino acids cysteine and methionine contain most of the sulfur. The element is thus present in all polypeptides, proteins, and enzymes that contain these amino acids. In humans, methionine is an essential amino acid that must be ingested. However, save for the vitamins biotin and thiamine, cysteine and all sulfur-containing compounds in the human body can be synthesized from methionine. The enzyme sulfite oxidase is needed for the metabolism of methionine and cysteine in humans and animals.</p>\n<p>Disulfide bonds (S-S bonds) formed between cysteine residues in peptide chains are very important in protein assembly and structure. These covalent bonds between peptide chains confer extra toughness and rigidity. For example, the high strength of feathers and hair is in part due to their high content of S-S bonds and their high content of cysteine and sulfur. Eggs are high in sulfur because large amounts of the element are necessary for feather formation, and the characteristic odor of rotting eggs is due to hydrogen sulfide. The high disulfide bond content of hair and feathers contributes to their indigestibility and to their characteristic disagreeable odor when burned.</p>\n<p>Homocysteine and taurine are other sulfur-containing acids that are similar in structure, but not coded by DNA, and are not part of the primary structure of proteins. Many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with -SH moieties to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals: two common examples from basic metabolism are coenzyme A and alpha-lipoic acid. Two of the 13 classical vitamins, biotin and thiamine contain sulfur, with the latter being named for its sulfur content. Sulfur plays an important part, as a carrier of reducing hydrogen and its electrons, for cellular repair of oxidation. Reduced glutathione, a sulfur-containing tripeptide, is a reducing agent through its sulfhydryl (-SH) moiety derived from cysteine. The thioredoxins, a class of small protein essential to all known life, using neighboring pairs of reduced cysteines to act as general protein reducing agents, to similar effect.</p>\n<p>Methanogenesis, the route to most of the world's methane, is a multistep biochemical transformation of carbon dioxide. This conversion requires several organosulfur cofactors. These include coenzyme M, CHSCHCHSO, the immediate precursor to methane.</p>\n<h3>Metalloproteins and inorganic cofactors</h3>\n<p>Inorganic sulfur forms a part of iron-sulfur clusters as well as many copper, nickel, and iron proteins. Most pervasive are the ferrodoxins, which serve as electron shuttles in cells. In bacteria, the important nitrogenase enzymes contains an Fe-Mo-S cluster, is a catalyst that performs the important function of nitrogen fixation, converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia that can be used by microorganisms and plants to make proteins, DNA, RNA, alkaloids, and the other organic nitrogen compounds necessary for life.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Sulfur metabolism and the sulfur cycle</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Sulfur metabolism and Sulfur cycle</div>\n<p>The sulfur cycle was the first of the biogeochemical cycles to be discovered. In the 1880s, while studying Beggiatoa (a bacterium living in a sulfur rich environment), Sergei Winogradsky found that it oxidized hydrogen sulfide (HS) as an energy source, forming intracellular sulfur droplets. Winogradsky referred to this form of metabolism as inorgoxidation (oxidation of inorganic compounds). He continued to study it together with Selman Waksman until the 1950s.</p>\n<p>Sulfur oxidizers can use as energy sources reduced sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, sulfite, thiosulfate, and various polythionates (e.g., tetrathionate). They depend on enzymes such as sulfur oxygenase and sulfite oxidase to oxidize sulfur to sulfate. Some lithotrophs can even use the energy contained in sulfur compounds to produce sugars, a process known as chemosynthesis. Some bacteria and archaea use hydrogen sulfide in place of water as the electron donor in chemosynthesis, a process similar to photosynthesis that produces sugars and utilizes oxygen as the electron acceptor. The photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria and some lithotrophs use elemental oxygen to carry out such oxidization of hydrogen sulfide to produce elemental sulfur (S), oxidation state = 0. Primitive bacteria that live around deep ocean volcanic vents oxidize hydrogen sulfide in this way with oxygen; see giant tube worm for an example of large organisms that use hydrogen sulfide (via bacteria) as food to be oxidized.</p>\n<p>The so-called sulfate-reducing bacteria, by contrast, \"breathe sulfate\" instead of oxygen. They use organic compounds or molecular hydrogen as the energy source. They use sulfur as the electron acceptor, and reduce various oxidized sulfur compounds back into sulfide, often into hydrogen sulfide. They can grow on a number of other partially oxidized sulfur compounds (e.g. thiosulfates, thionates, polysulfides, sulfites). The hydrogen sulfide produced by these bacteria is responsible for some of the smell of intestinal gases (flatus) and decomposition products.</p>\n<p>Sulfur is absorbed by plants via the roots from soil as the sulfate and transported as a phosphate ester. Sulfate is reduced to sulfide via sulfite before it is incorporated into cysteine and other organosulfur compounds.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>SO → SO → HS → cysteine → methionine</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEffect of acid rain on a forest, Jizera Mountains, Czech Republic</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Elemental sulfur is non-toxic, as generally are the soluble sulfate salts, such as Epsom salts. Soluble sulfate salts are poorly absorbed and laxative. However, when injected parenterally, they are freely filtered by the kidneys and eliminated with very little toxicity in multi-gram amounts.</p>\n<p>When sulfur burns in air, it produces sulfur dioxide. In water, this gas produces sulfurous acid and sulfites, which are antioxidants that inhibit growth of aerobic bacteria and allow its use as a food additive in small amounts. However, at high concentrations these acids harm the lungs, eyes or other tissues. In organisms without lungs such as insects or plants, it otherwise prevents respiration in high concentrations. Sulfur trioxide (made by catalysis from sulfur dioxide) and sulfuric acid are similarly highly corrosive, due to the strong acids that form on contact with water.</p>\n<p>The burning of coal and/or petroleum by industry and power plants generates sulfur dioxide (SO), which reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid (HSO) and sulfurous acid (HSO). These acids are components of acid rain, which lower the pH of soil and freshwater bodies, sometimes resulting in substantial damage to the environment and chemical weathering of statues and structures. Fuel standards increasingly require that fuel producers extract sulfur from fossil fuels to prevent acid rain formation. This extracted and refined sulfur represents a large portion of sulfur production. In coal-fired power plants, flue gases are sometimes purified. More modern power plants that use synthesis gas extract the sulfur before they burn the gas.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen sulfide is as toxic as hydrogen cyanide, and kills by the same mechanism, though hydrogen sulfide is less likely to cause surprise poisonings from small inhaled amounts, because of its disagreeable warning odor. Though pungent at first, however, hydrogen sulfide quickly deadens the sense of smell—so a victim may breathe increasing quantities and be unaware of its presence until severe symptoms occur, which can quickly lead to death. Dissolved sulfide and hydrosulfide salts are also toxic by the same mechanism.</p>\n"

  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For the bleach, see Sodium hypochlorite.  For the film, see Chlorine (film).  For the unit of volume, see Centilitre.  For other uses of \"Cl\", see CL (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Chlorine</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Cl</b> and atomic number&nbsp;17. Chlorine is in the halogen group (17) and is the second lightest halogen after fluorine. The element is a yellow-green gas under standard conditions, where it forms diatomic molecules. It has the highest electron affinity and the third highest electronegativity of all the elements; for this reason, chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent. Free chlorine is rare on Earth, and is usually a result of direct or indirect oxidation by oxygen.</p>\n<p>The most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride, has been known since ancient times. Around 1630 chlorine gas was first synthesized in a chemical reaction, but not recognized as a fundamentally important substance. Characterization of chlorine gas was made in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who supposed it an oxide of a new element. In 1809 chemists suggested that the gas might be a pure element, and this was confirmed by Sir Humphry Davy in 1810, who named it from Ancient Greek: χλωρóς&nbsp;khlôros&nbsp;\"pale green\".</p>\n<p>Nearly all chlorine in the Earth's crust occurs as chloride in various ionic compounds, including table salt. It is the second most abundant halogen and 21 most abundant chemical element in Earth's crust. Elemental chlorine is commercially produced from brine by electrolysis. The high oxidizing potential of elemental chlorine led commercially to free chlorine's bleaching and disinfectant uses, as well as its many uses of an essential reagent in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, as well as many intermediates for production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary.</p>\n<p>In the form of chloride ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils, as part of the immune response against bacteria. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was historically used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical characteristics of chlorine and its compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChlorine, liquefied under a pressure of 7.4 bar at room temperature, displayed in a quartz ampule embedded in acrylic glass.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>At standard temperature and pressure, two chlorine atoms form the diatomic molecule Cl. This is a yellow-green gas that has a distinctive strong odor, familiar to most from common household bleach. The bonding between the two atoms is relatively weak (only 242.580 ± 0.004&nbsp;kJ/mol), which makes the Cl molecule highly reactive. The boiling point at regular atmosphere is around −34 ˚C, but it can be liquefied at room temperature with pressures above 740 kPa.</p>\n<p>Although elemental chlorine is yellow-green, chloride ion, in common with other halide ions, has no color in either minerals or solutions (example, table salt). Similarly, (again as with other halogens) chlorine atoms impart no color to organic chlorides when they replace hydrogen atoms in colorless organic compounds, such as tetrachloromethane. The melting point and density of these compounds is increased by substitution of hydrogen in place of chlorine. Compounds of chlorine with other halogens, however, as well as many chlorine oxides, are visibly colored.</p>\n<h3>Chemical characteristics</h3>\n<p>Along with fluorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine, chlorine is a member of the halogen series that forms the group 17 (formerly VII, VIIA, or VIIB) of the periodic table. Chlorine forms compounds with almost all of the elements to give compounds that are usually called chlorides. Chlorine gas reacts with most organic compounds, and will even sluggishly support the combustion of hydrocarbons.</p>\n<h4>Hydrolysis of free chlorine or disproportionation in water</h4>\n<p>At 25&nbsp;°C and atmospheric pressure, one liter of water dissolves 3.26&nbsp;g or 1.125&nbsp;L of gaseous chlorine. Solutions of chlorine in water contain chlorine (Cl), hydrochloric acid, and hypochlorous acid:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Cl + HO  HCl + HClO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This conversion to the right is called disproportionation, because the ingredient chlorine both increases and decreases in formal oxidation state. The solubility of chlorine in water is increased if the water contains dissolved alkali hydroxide, and in this way, chlorine bleach is produced.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Cl + 2 OH → ClO + Cl + HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Chlorine gas only exists in a neutral or acidic solution.</p>\n<h4>Chemistry and compounds</h4>\n<div>See also category: Chlorine compounds</div>\n<p>Chlorine exists in all odd numbered oxidation states from −1 to +7, as well as the elemental state of zero and four in chlorine dioxide (see table below, and also structures in chlorite). Progressing through the states, hydrochloric acid can be oxidized using manganese dioxide, or hydrogen chloride gas oxidized catalytically by air to form elemental chlorine gas.</p>\n\n<h5>Chlorides</h5>\n<div>Main article: Chloride</div>\n<p>Chlorine combines with almost all elements to give chlorides. Compounds with oxygen, nitrogen, xenon, and krypton are known, but do not form by direct reaction of the elements. Chloride is one of the most common anions in nature. Hydrogen chloride and its aqueous solution, hydrochloric acid, are produced on megaton scale annually both as valued intermediates but sometimes as undesirable pollutants.</p>\n<h5>Chlorine oxides</h5>\n<p>Chlorine forms a variety of oxides, as seen above: chlorine dioxide (ClO), dichlorine monoxide (ClO), dichlorine hexoxide (ClO), dichlorine heptoxide (ClO). The anionic derivatives of these same oxides are also well known including chlorate (ClO−\n3), chlorite (ClO−\n2), hypochlorite (ClO), and perchlorate (ClO−\n4). The acid derivatives of these anions are hypochlorous acid (HOCl), chloric acid (HClO) and perchloric acid (HClO). The chloroxy cation chloryl (ClO) is known and has the same structure as chlorite but with a positive charge and chlorine in the +5 oxidation state. The compound \"chlorine trioxide\" does not occur, but rather in gas form is found as the dimeric dichlorine hexoxide (ClO) with a +6 oxidation state. This compound in liquid or solid form disproportionates to a mixture of +5 and +7 oxidation states, occurring as the ionic compound chloryl perchlorate, [ClO\n2]+[ClO\n4]−.</p>\n<p>In hot concentrated alkali solution hypochlorite disproportionates:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 ClO → Cl + ClO−\n2</dd>\n<dd>ClO + ClO−\n2 → Cl + ClO−\n3</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Sodium chlorate and potassium chlorate can be crystallized from solutions formed by the above reactions. If their crystals are heated, they undergo a further, final disproportionation:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 ClO−\n3 → Cl + 3 ClO−\n4</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This same progression from chloride to perchlorate can be accomplished by electrolysis. The anode reaction progression is:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Each step is accompanied at the cathode by</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 HO + 2 e → 2 OH + H (−0.83 volts)</dd>\n</dl>\n<h5>Interhalogen compounds</h5>\n<p>Chlorine oxidizes bromide and iodide salts to bromine and iodine, respectively. However, it cannot oxidize fluoride salts to fluorine. It makes a variety of interhalogen compounds, such as the chlorine fluorides, chlorine monofluoride (ClF), chlorine trifluoride (ClF\n3), chlorine pentafluoride (ClF\n5). Chlorides of bromine and iodine are also known.</p>\n<h5>Organochlorine compounds</h5>\n<div>Main article: Organochloride</div>\n<p>Chlorine is used extensively in organic chemistry in substitution and addition reactions. Chlorine often imparts many desired properties to an organic compound, in part owing to its electronegativity.</p>\n<p>Like the other halides, chlorine undergoes electrophilic addition reactions, the most notable one being the chlorination of alkenes and aromatic compounds with a Lewis acid catalyst. Organic chlorine compounds tend to be less reactive in nucleophilic substitution reactions than the corresponding bromine or iodine derivatives, but they tend to be cheaper. They may be activated for reaction by substituting with a tosylate group, or by the use of a catalytic amount of sodium iodide.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also category: Halide minerals</div>\n<p>In the interstellar medium, chlorine is produced in supernovae via the r-process.</p>\n<p>In meteorites and on Earth, chlorine is found primarily as the chloride ion which occurs in minerals. In the Earth's crust, chlorine is present at average concentrations of about 126 parts per million, predominantly in such minerals as <i>halite</i> (sodium chloride), <i>sylvite</i> (potassium chloride), and <i>carnallite</i> (potassium magnesium chloride hexahydrate).</p>\n<p>Chloride is a component of the salt that is deposited in the earth or dissolved in the oceans — about 1.9% of the mass of seawater is chloride ions. Even higher concentrations of chloride are found in the Dead Sea and in underground brine deposits. Most chloride salts are soluble in water, thus, chloride-containing minerals are usually only found in abundance in dry climates or deep underground.</p>\n<p>Over 2000 naturally occurring organic chlorine compounds are known.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of chlorine</div>\n<p>Chlorine has a wide range of isotopes. The two stable isotopes are Cl (75.77%) and Cl (24.23%). Together they give chlorine an atomic weight of 35.4527&nbsp;g/mol. The half-integer value for chlorine's weight caused some confusion in the early days of chemistry, when it had been postulated that atoms were composed of even units of hydrogen (see Proust's law), and the existence of chemical isotopes was unsuspected.</p>\n<p>Trace amounts of radioactive Cl exist in the environment, in a ratio of about 7x10 to 1 with stable isotopes. Cl is produced in the atmosphere by spallation of Ar by interactions with cosmic ray protons. In the subsurface environment, Cl is generated primarily as a result of neutron capture by Cl or muon capture by Ca. Cl decays to S and to Ar, with a combined half-life of 308,000 years. The half-life of this hydrophilic nonreactive isotope makes it suitable for geologic dating in the range of 60,000 to 1&nbsp;million years. Additionally, large amounts of Cl were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and ground water, Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride, has been known since ancient times; archaeologists have found evidence that rock salt was used as early as 3000 BC and brine as early as 6000 BC. Around 1630, chlorine was recognized as a gas by the Belgian chemist and physician Jan Baptist van Helmont.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCarl Wilhelm Scheele</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Elemental chlorine was first prepared and studied in 1774 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and, therefore, he is credited for its discovery. He called it \"<i>dephlogisticated muriatic acid air</i>\" since it is a gas (then called \"airs\") and it came from hydrochloric acid (then known as \"muriatic acid\"). However, he failed to establish chlorine as an element, mistakenly thinking that it was the oxide obtained from the hydrochloric acid (see phlogiston theory). He named the new element within this oxide as <i>muriaticum</i>. Regardless of what he thought, Scheele did isolate chlorine by reacting MnO (as the mineral pyrolusite) with HCl:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 HCl + MnO → MnCl + 2 HO + Cl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Scheele observed several of the properties of chlorine: the bleaching effect on litmus, the deadly effect on insects, the yellow green color, and the smell similar to aqua regia.</p>\n<p>At the time, common chemical theory was: any acid is a compound that contains oxygen (still sounding in the German and Dutch names of oxygen: <i>sauerstoff</i> or <i>zuurstof</i>, both translating into English as <i>acid stuff</i>), so a number of chemists, including Claude Berthollet, suggested that Scheele's <i>dephlogisticated muriatic acid air</i> must be a combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, <i>muriaticum</i>.</p>\n<p>In 1809, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Thénard tried to decompose <i>dephlogisticated muriatic acid air</i> by reacting it with charcoal to release the free element <i>muriaticum</i> (and carbon dioxide). They did not succeed and published a report in which they considered the possibility that <i>dephlogisticated muriatic acid air</i> is an element, but were not convinced.</p>\n<p>In 1810, Sir Humphry Davy tried the same experiment again, and concluded that it is an element, and not a compound. He named this new element as chlorine, from the Greek word χλωρος (<i>chlōros</i>), meaning green-yellow. The name <b>halogen</b>, meaning \"salt producer,\" was originally used for chlorine in 1811 by Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger. However, this term was later used as a generic term to describe all the elements in the chlorine family (fluorine, bromine, iodine), after a suggestion by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1842. In 1823, Michael Faraday liquefied chlorine for the first time, and demonstrated that what was then known as \"solid chlorine\" had a structure of chlorine hydrate (Cl·HO).</p>\n<p>Chlorine gas was first used by French chemist Claude Berthollet to bleach textiles in 1785. Modern bleaches resulted from further work by Berthollet, who first produced sodium hypochlorite in 1789 in his laboratory in the town of Javel (now part of Paris, France), by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as \"<i>Eau de Javel</i>\" (\"Javel water\"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. However, this process was not very efficient, and alternative production methods were sought. Scottish chemist and industrialist Charles Tennant first produced a solution of calcium hypochlorite (\"chlorinated lime\"), then solid calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder). These compounds produced low levels of elemental chlorine, and could be more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite, which remained as dilute solutions because when purified to eliminate water, it became a dangerously powerful and unstable oxidizer. Near the end of the nineteenth century, E. S. Smith patented a method of sodium hypochlorite production involving electrolysis of brine to produce sodium hydroxide and chlorine gas, which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite. This is known as the chloralkali process, first introduced on an industrial scale in 1892, and now the source of essentially all modern elemental chlorine and sodium hydroxide production (a related low-temperature electrolysis reaction, the Hooker process, is now responsible for bleach and sodium hypochlorite production).</p>\n<p>Elemental chlorine solutions dissolved in chemically basic water (sodium and calcium hypochlorite) were first used as anti-putrification agents and disinfectants in the 1820s, in France, long before the establishment of the germ theory of disease. This work is mainly due to Antoine-Germain Labarraque, who adapted Berthollet's \"Javel water\" bleach and other chlorine preparations for the purpose (see a more complete history, see below). Elemental chlorine has since served a continuous function in topical antisepsis (wound irrigation solutions and the like) as well as public sanitation (especially of swimming and drinking water).</p>\n<p>In 1826, silver chloride was used to produce photographic images for the first time. Chloroform was first used as an anesthetic in 1847.</p>\n<p>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was invented in 1912, initially without a purpose.</p>\n<p>Chlorine gas was first introduced as a weapon on April 22, 1915, at Ypres by the German Army, and the results of this weapon were disastrous because gas masks had not been mass distributed and were tricky to get on quickly.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLiquid chlorine analysis</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main articles: Chlorine production and Chloralkali process</div>\n<p>In industry, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water. This method, the chloralkali process industrialized in 1892, now provides essentially all industrial chlorine gas. Along with chlorine, the method yields hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide (with sodium hydroxide actually being the most crucial of the three industrial products produced by the process). The process proceeds according to the following chemical equation:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 NaCl + 2 HO → Cl + H + 2 NaOH</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The electrolysis of chloride solutions all proceed according to the following equations:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Cathode: 2 H (aq) + 2 e → H (g)</dd>\n<dd>Anode: 2 Cl (aq) → Cl (g) + 2 e</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Overall process: 2 NaCl (or KCl) + 2 HO → Cl + H + 2 NaOH (or KOH)</p>\n<p>In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, preventing the chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali but they are not burdened with the problem of preventing mercury discharge into the environment and they are more energy efficient. Membrane cell electrolysis employ permeable membrane as an ion exchanger. Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment, leaving at a lower concentration. This method is more efficient than the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide at about 32% concentration, but requires very pure brine.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMembrane cell process for chloralkali production</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Laboratory methods</h3>\n<p>Small amounts of chlorine gas can be made in the laboratory by combining hydrochloric acid and manganese dioxide. Alternatively a strong acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hypochlorite solution to release chlorine gas but reacts with sodium chlorate to produce chlorine gas and chlorine dioxide gas as well. In the home, accidents occur when hypochlorite bleach solutions are combined with certain acidic drain-cleaners.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Production of industrial and consumer products</h3>\n<p>Principal applications of chlorine are in the production of a wide range of industrial and consumer products. For example, it is used in making plastics, solvents for dry cleaning and metal degreasing, textiles, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, insecticides, dyestuffs, household cleaning products, etc.</p>\n<p>Many important industrial products are produced via organochlorine intermediates. Examples include polycarbonates, polyurethanes, silicones, polytetrafluoroethylene, carboxymethyl cellulose, and propylene oxide. Like the other halogens, chlorine participates in free-radical substitution reactions with hydrogen-containing organic compounds. When applied to organic substrates, reaction is often—but not invariably—non-regioselective, and, hence, may result in a mixture of isomeric products. It is often difficult to control the degree of substitution as well, so multiple substitutions are common. If the different reaction products are easily separated, e.g., by distillation, substitutive free-radical chlorination (in some cases accompanied by concurrent thermal dehydrochlorination) may be a useful synthetic route. Industrial examples of this are the production of methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride from methane, allyl chloride from propylene, and trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene from 1,2-dichloroethane.</p>\n<p>Quantitatively, about 63% and 18% of all elemental chlorine produced is used in the manufacture of organic and inorganic chlorine compounds, respectively,. About 15,000 chlorine compounds are being used commercially. The remaining 19% is used for bleaches and disinfection products. The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, intermediates in the production of PVC. Other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, vinylidene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and trichlorobenzenes. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, ClO, HOCl, NaClO, chlorinated isocyanurates, AlCl, SiCl, SnCl, PCl, PCl, POCl, AsCl, SbCl, SbCl, BiCl, SCl, SCl, SOCI, CIF, ICl, ICl, TiCl, TiCl, MoCl, FeCl, ZnCl, etc.</p>\n<h3>Public sanitation, disinfection, and antisepsis</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Water chlorination, Bleach, and Antoine Labarraque</div>\n<h4>Combating putrefaction</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAntoine-Germain Labarraque</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In France (as elsewhere) there was a need to process animal guts in order to make musical instrument strings, Goldbeater's skin and other products. This was carried out in \"gut factories\" (<i>boyauderies</i>) as an odiferous and unhealthy business. In or about 1820, the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale offered a prize for the discovery of a method, chemical or mechanical, that could be used to separate the peritoneal membrane of animal intestines without causing putrefaction. It was won by Antoine-Germain Labarraque, a 44 year-old French chemist and pharmacist who had discovered that Berthollet's chlorinated bleaching solutions (\"<i>Eau de Javel</i>\") not only destroyed the smell of putrefaction of animal tissue decomposition, but also retarded the decomposition process itself.</p>\n<p>Labarraque's research resulted in chlorides and hypochlorites of lime (calcium hypochlorite) and of sodium (sodium hypochlorite) being employed not only in the <i>boyauderies</i> but also for the routine disinfection and deodorisation of latrines, sewers, markets, abattoirs, anatomical theatres and morgues. They were also used, with success, in hospitals, lazarets, prisons, infirmaries (both on land and at sea), magnaneries, stables, cattle-sheds, etc.; and for exhumations, embalming, during outbreaks of epidemic illness, fever, blackleg in cattle, etc.</p>\n<h4>Against infection and contagion</h4>\n<p>Labarraque's chlorinated lime and soda solutions had been advocated in 1828 to prevent infection (called \"contagious infection\", and presumed to be transmitted by \"miasmas\") and also to treat putrefaction of existing wounds, including septic wounds. In this 1828 work, Labarraque recommended for the doctor to breathe chlorine, wash his hands with chlorinated lime, and even sprinkle chlorinated lime about the patient's bed, in cases of \"contagious infection.\" In 1828, it was well known that some infections were contagious, even though the agency of the microbe was not to be realized or discovered for more than half a century.</p>\n<p>During the Paris cholera outbreak of 1832, large quantities of so-called <i>chloride of lime</i> were used to disinfect the capital. This was not simply modern calcium chloride, but contained chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute calcium hydroxide) to form calcium hypochlorite (chlorinated lime). Labarraque's discovery helped to remove the terrible stench of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms, and, by doing so, effectively deodorised the Latin Quarter of Paris. These \"putrid miasmas\" were thought by many to be responsible for the spread of \"contagion\" and \"infection\" – both words used before the germ theory of infection. The use of chloride of lime was based on destruction of odors and \"putrid matter.\" One source has claimed that chloride of lime was used by Dr. John Snow to disinfect water from the cholera-contaminated well feeding the Broad Street pump in 1854 London. Three reputable sources that described the famous Broad Street pump cholera epidemic do not mention Snow performing any disinfection of water from that well. Instead, one reference makes it clear that chloride of lime was used to disinfect the offal and filth in the streets surrounding the Broad Street pump—a common practice in mid-nineteenth century England.</p>\n<h4>Semmelweis and experiments with antisepsis</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nIgnaz Semmelweis</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Perhaps the most famous application of Labarraque's chlorine and chemical base solutions was in 1847, when Ignaz Semmelweis used (first) chlorine-water (simply chlorine dissolved in pure water), then cheaper chlorinated lime solutions, to deodorize the hands of Austrian doctors, which Semmelweis noticed still carried the stench of decomposition from the dissection rooms to the patient examination rooms. Semmelweis, still long before the germ theory of disease, had theorized that \"cadaveric particles\" were somehow transmitting decay from fresh medical cadavers to living patients, and he used the well-known \"Labarraque's solutions\" as the only known method to remove the smell of decay and tissue decomposition (which he found that soap did not). The solutions proved to be far more effective germicide antiseptics than soap (Semmelweis was also aware of their greater efficacy, but not the reason), and this resulted in Semmelweis's (later) celebrated success in stopping the transmission of childbed fever (\"puerperal fever\") in the maternity wards of Vienna General Hospital in Austria in 1847.</p>\n<p>Much later, during World War I in 1916, a standardized and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution, containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, was developed by Henry Drysdale Dakin (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area). Called Dakin's solution, the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment of a wide variety of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in the modern era, where it remains effective against multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria (see Century Pharmaceuticals).</p>\n<h4>Public sanitation</h4>\n<p>By 1918, the US Department of Treasury called for all drinking water to be disinfected with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for water purification (such as water treatment plants), in disinfectants, and in bleach. Chlorine in water is more than three times as effective as a disinfectant against <i>Escherichia coli</i> than an equivalent concentration of bromine, and is more than six times more effective than an equivalent concentration of iodine.</p>\n<p>Chlorine is usually used (in the form of hypochlorous acid) to kill bacteria and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather sodium hypochlorite, formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide, or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with a human's hair and skin because hair and skin are made from protein. (Reaction with protein amino groups) Once the chlorine reacts with the hair and skin, it becomes chemically bonded. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.</p>\n<p>It is often impractical to store and use poisonous chlorine gas for water treatment, so alternative methods of adding chlorine are used. These include hypochlorite solutions, which gradually release chlorine into the water, and compounds like sodium dichloro-s-triazinetrione (dihydrate or anhydrous), sometimes referred to as \"dichlor\", and trichloro-s-triazinetrione, sometimes referred to as \"trichlor\". These compounds are stable while solid and may be used in powdered, granular, or tablet form. When added in small amounts to pool water or industrial water systems, the chlorine atoms hydrolyze from the rest of the molecule forming hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which acts as a general biocide, killing germs, micro-organisms, algae, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Use as a weapon</h3>\n<h4>World War I</h4>\n<div>Main article: Poison gas in World War I</div>\n<p>Chlorine gas, also known as <b>bertholite</b>, was first used as a weapon in World War I by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres. As described by the soldiers it had a distinctive smell of a mixture between pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung the back of the throat and chest. Chlorine can react with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form hydrochloric acid, an irritant that can be lethal. The damage done by chlorine gas can be prevented by a gas mask, or other filtration method, which makes the overall chance of death by chlorine gas much lower than those of other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben, who developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an entrenched enemy. It is alleged that Haber's role in the use of chlorine as a deadly weapon drove his wife, Clara Immerwahr, to suicide. After its first use, chlorine was utilized by both sides as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly phosgene and mustard gas.</p>\n<h4>Iraq War</h4>\n<div>Main article: 2007 chlorine bombings in Iraq</div>\n<p>Chlorine gas has also been used by insurgents against the local population and coalition forces in the Iraq War in the form of chlorine bombs. On March 17, 2007, for example, three chlorine-filled trucks were detonated in the Anbar province killing two and sickening over 350. Other chlorine bomb attacks resulted in higher death tolls, with more than 30 deaths on two separate occasions. Most of the deaths were caused by the force of the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine, since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. The Iraqi authorities have tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water for the population.</p>\n<h3>Chlorine induced cracking in structural materials</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChlorine \"attack\" on an acetal resin plumbing joint.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The element is widely used for purifying water owing to its powerful oxidizing properties, especially potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred owing to chlorine induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel rods used to suspend them. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic supplies, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows an acetal joint in a water supply system, which, when it fractured, caused substantial physical damage to computers in the labs below the supply. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and grew slowly until finally triggered. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.</p>\n<h2>Health effects of the free element and hazards</h2>\n\n<p>Chlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system. Because it is heavier than air, it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.</p>\n<p>Chlorine is detectable with measuring devices in concentrations of as low as 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60&nbsp;ppm. About 1000&nbsp;ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system, and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations above 30&nbsp;ppm, it begins to react with water and cells, which change it into hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).</p>\n<p>When used at specified levels for water disinfection, the reaction of chlorine with water is not a major concern for human health. Other materials present in the water may generate disinfection by-products that are associated with negative effects on human health, although the health risk is far lower than drinking undisinfected water.</p>\n<h2>Organochlorine compounds as pollutants</h2>\n<p>Some organochlorine compounds are serious pollutants. These are produced either as side products of industrial processes or as end products which are persistent in the environment, such as certain chlorinated pesticides and chlorofluorocarbons. Chlorine is added both to pesticides and pharmaceuticals to make the molecules more resistant to enzymatic degradation by bacteria, insects, and mammals, but this property also has the effect of prolonging the residence time of these compounds when they enter the environment. In this respect chlorinated organics have some resemblance to fluorinated organics.</p>\n"

  "title": "Argon",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Argon (disambiguation).</div>\n<div>Not to be confused with Argonne (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Argon</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Ar</b> and atomic number&nbsp;18. It is in group 18 of the periodic table and is a noble gas. Argon is the third most common gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.93% (9,300 ppm), making it approximately 23.8 times as abundant as next most common atmospheric gas, carbon dioxide (390 ppm), and more than 500 times as abundant as the next most common noble gas, neon (18 ppm). Nearly all of this argon is radiogenic argon-40 derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust. In the universe, argon-36 is by far the most common argon isotope, being the preferred argon isotope produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas.</p>\n<p>The name \"argon\" is derived from the Greek word <b>αργον</b>, neuter singular form of <b>αργος</b> meaning \"lazy\" or \"inactive\", as a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions. The complete octet (eight electrons) in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its triple point temperature of 83.8058&nbsp;K is a defining fixed point in the International Temperature Scale of 1990.</p>\n<p>Argon is produced industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon gas also has uses in incandescent and fluorescent lighting, and other types of gas discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA small piece of rapidly melting solid argon.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Argon has approximately the same solubility in water as oxygen, and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than nitrogen. Argon is colorless, odorless, and nontoxic as a solid, liquid, and gas. Argon is chemically inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.</p>\n<p>Although argon is a noble gas, it has been found to have the capability of forming some compounds. For example, the creation of argon fluorohydride (HArF), a marginally stable compound of argon with fluorine and hydrogen, was reported by researchers at the University of Helsinki in 2000. Although the neutral ground-state chemical compounds of argon are presently limited to HArF, argon can form clathrates with water when atoms of it are trapped in a lattice of the water molecules. Argon-containing ions and excited state complexes, such as ArH+ and ArF, respectively, are known to exist. Theoretical calculations have predicted several argon compounds that should be stable, but for which no synthesis routes are currently known.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLord Rayleigh's method for the isolation of argon, based on an experiment of Henry Cavendish's. The gases are contained in a test-tube (A) standing over a large quantity of weak alkali (B), and the current is conveyed in wires insulated by U-shaped glass tubes (CC) passing through the liquid and round the mouth of the test-tube. The inner platinum ends (DD) of the wire receive a current from a battery of five Grove cells and a Ruhmkorff coil of medium size.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><i>Argon</i> (αργον, neuter singular form of αργος, Greek meaning \"inactive\", in reference to its chemical inactivity) was suspected to be present in air by Henry Cavendish in 1785 but was not isolated until 1894 by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay in Scotland in an experiment in which they removed all of the oxygen, carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen from a sample of clean air. They had determined that nitrogen produced from chemical compounds was one-half percent lighter than nitrogen from the atmosphere. The difference seemed insignificant, but it was important enough to attract their attention for many months. They concluded that there was another gas in the air mixed in with the nitrogen. Argon was also encountered in 1882 through independent research of H. F. Newall and W.N. Hartley. Each observed new lines in the color spectrum of air but were unable to identify the element responsible for the lines. Argon became the first member of the noble gases to be discovered. The symbol for argon is now \"Ar\", but up until 1957 it was \"A\".</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<p>Argon constitutes 0.934% by volume and 1.28% by mass of the Earth's atmosphere, and air is the primary raw material used by industry to produce purified argon products. Argon is isolated from air by fractionation, most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation, a process that also produces purified nitrogen, oxygen, neon, krypton and xenon.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of argon</div>\n<p>The main isotopes of argon found on Earth are 40Ar (99.6%), 36Ar (0.34%), and 38Ar (0.06%). Naturally occurring 40K with a half-life of 1.25×10 years, decays to stable 40Ar (11.2%) by electron capture or positron emission, and also to stable 40Ca (88.8%) via beta decay. These properties and ratios are used to determine the age of rocks by the method of K-Ar dating.</p>\n<p>In the Earth's atmosphere, 39Ar is made by cosmic ray activity, primarily with 40Ar. In the subsurface environment, it is also produced through neutron capture by 39K or alpha emission by calcium. 37Ar is created from the neutron spallation of 40Ca as a result of subsurface nuclear explosions. It has a half-life of 35 days.</p>\n<p>Argon is notable in that its isotopic composition varies greatly between different locations in the solar system. Where the major source of argon is the decay of 40K in rocks, 40Ar will be the dominant isotope, as it is on Earth. Argon produced directly by stellar nucleosynthesis, in contrast, is dominated by the alpha process nuclide, 36Ar. Correspondingly, solar argon contains 84.6% 36Ar based on solar wind measurements. Primordial 36Ar has an abundance of only 31.5 ppmv (= 9340 ppmv x 0.337%), comparable to that of neon (18.18 ppmv). The Martian atmosphere contains 1.6% of 40Ar and 5&nbsp;ppm of 36Ar. The Mariner space probe fly-by of the planet Mercury in 1973 found that Mercury has a very thin atmosphere with 70% argon, believed to result from releases of the gas as a decay product from radioactive materials on the planet. In 2005, the <i>Huygens</i> probe also discovered the presence of 40Ar on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. Similarly, the ratio of the three isotopes Ar: Ar: Ar in the atmospheres of the outer planets is measured to be 8400: 1600: 1</p>\n<p>The predominance of radiogenic 40Ar is responsible for the fact that the standard atomic weight of terrestrial argon is greater than that of the next element, potassium. This was puzzling at the time when argon was discovered, since Mendeleev had placed the elements in his periodic table in order of atomic weight, although the inertness of argon implies that it must be placed before the reactive alkali metal potassium. Henry Moseley later solved this problem by showing that the periodic table is actually arranged in order of atomic number. (See History of the periodic table).</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also: Van der Waals molecule</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSpace-filling model of argon fluorohydride.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Argon's complete octet of electrons indicates full s and p subshells. This full outer energy level makes argon very stable and extremely resistant to bonding with other elements. Before 1962, argon and the other noble gases were considered to be chemically inert and unable to form compounds; however, compounds of the heavier noble gases have since been synthesized. In August 2000, the first argon compound was formed by researchers at the University of Helsinki. By shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride with caesium iodide, argon fluorohydride (HArF) was formed. It is stable up to 40&nbsp;kelvin (−233&nbsp;°C). The metastable ArCF2+\n2 dication, which is valence isoelectronic with carbonyl fluoride, was observed in 2010.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<h3>Industrial</h3>\n<p>Argon is produced industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air in a cryogenic air separation unit; a process that separates liquid nitrogen, which boils at 77.3&nbsp;K, from argon, which boils at 87.3&nbsp;K, and liquid oxygen, which boils at 90.2&nbsp;K. About 700,000 tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year.</p>\n<h3>In radioactive decays</h3>\n<p>Ar, the most abundant isotope of argon, is produced by the decay of K with a half-life of 1.25×10 years by electron capture or positron emission. Because of this, it is used in potassium-argon dating to determine the age of rocks.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCylinders containing argon gas for use in extinguishing fire without damaging server equipment</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>There are several different reasons argon is used in particular applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An inert gas is needed. In particular, argon is the cheapest alternative when nitrogen is not sufficiently inert.</li>\n<li>Low thermal conductivity is required.</li>\n<li>The electronic properties (ionization and/or the emission spectrum) are necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other noble gases would probably work as well in most of these applications, but argon is by far the cheapest. Argon is inexpensive since it is a byproduct of the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen from a cryogenic air separation unit, both of which are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far, since it has a much higher concentration in the atmosphere. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.</p>\n<h3>Industrial processes</h3>\n<p>Argon is used in some high-temperature industrial processes, where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive. For example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning.</p>\n<p>For some of these processes, the presence of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. Argon is used in various types of arc welding such as gas metal arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding, as well as in the processing of titanium and other reactive elements. An argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of silicon and germanium.</p>\n<div>See also: shielding gas</div>\n<p>Argon is an asphyxiant in the poultry industry, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon's relatively high density causes it to remain close to the ground during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.</p>\n<p>Argon is sometimes used for extinguishing fires where damage to equipment is to be avoided.</p>\n<h3>Scientific research</h3>\n<p>Liquid argon is used as the target for direct dark matter searches. The interaction of a hypothetical WIMP particle with the argon nucleus produces scintillation light that is detected by photomultiplier tubes. Two-phase detectors also use argon gas to detect the ionized electrons produced during the WIMP-nucleus scattering. As with most other liquefied noble gases, argon has a high scintillation lightyield (~ 51 photons / keV), is transparent to its own scintillation light, and is relatively easy to purify. Compared to xenon, argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils. On the other hand, its intrinsic gamma-ray background is larger due to 39Ar contamination, unless one uses underground argon sources with a low level of radioactivity. Dark matter detectors currently operating with liquid argon include WArP, ArDM, microCLEAN and DEAP-I.</p>\n<h3>Preservative</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA sample of caesium is packed under argon to avoid reactions with air</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Argon is used to displace oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents (argon has the European food additive code of <i>E938</i>). Aerial oxidation, hydrolysis, and other chemical reactions which degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely. Bottles of high-purity chemicals and certain pharmaceutical products are available in sealed bottles or ampoules packed in argon. In wine making, argon is used to top-off barrels to avoid the aerial oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid during the aging process.</p>\n<p>Argon is also available in aerosol-type cans, which may be used to preserve compounds such as varnish, polyurethane, paint, etc. for storage after opening.</p>\n<p>Since 2002, the American National Archives stores important national documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution within argon-filled cases to retard their degradation. Using argon reduces gas leakage, compared with the helium used in the preceding five decades.</p>\n<h3>Laboratory equipment</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGloveboxes are often filled with argon, which recirculates over scrubbers to maintain an oxygen-, nitrogen-, and moisture-free atmosphere</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Air-free technique</div>\n<p>Argon may be used as the inert gas within Schlenk lines and gloveboxes. The use of argon over comparatively less expensive nitrogen is preferred where nitrogen may react with the experimental reagents or apparatus.</p>\n<p>Argon may be used as the carrier gas in gas chromatography and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in ICP spectroscopy. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Argon gas is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication.</p>\n<h3>Medical use</h3>\n<p>Cryosurgery procedures such as cryoablation use liquefied argon to destroy cancer cells. In surgery it is used in a procedure called \"argon enhanced coagulation\" which is a form of argon plasma beam electrosurgery. The procedure carries a risk of producing gas embolism in the patient and has resulted in the death of one person via this type of accident. Blue argon lasers are used in surgery to weld arteries, destroy tumors, and to correct eye defects. It has also been used experimentally to replace nitrogen in the breathing or decompression mix, to speed the elimination of dissolved nitrogen from the blood. See Argox.</p>\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nArgon gas-discharge lamp forming the symbol for argon \"Ar\". Small amounts of mercury are sometimes added to argon to produce an electric blue color, as in this picture.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Incandescent lights are filled with argon, to preserve the filaments at high temperature from oxidation. It is used for the specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics. Gas-discharge lamps filled with argon provide blue light. Argon is also used for the creation of blue and green laser light.</p>\n<h3>Miscellaneous uses</h3>\n<p>It is used for thermal insulation in energy efficient windows. Argon is also used in technical scuba diving to inflate a dry suit, because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity. Argon is being used as a propellant in the development of the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR). Compressed argon gas is allowed to expand, to cool the seeker heads of the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, and other missiles that use cooled thermal seeker heads. The gas is stored at high pressure.</p>\n<p>Argon-39, with a half-life of 269 years, has been used for a number of applications, primarily ice core and ground water dating. Also, potassium-argon dating is used in dating igneous rocks.</p>\n<h2>Safety</h2>\n<p>Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and is therefore considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. It is also difficult to detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces, and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.</p>\n"

  "title": "Potassium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Potassium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>K</b> (from Neo-Latin <i>kalium</i>) and atomic number&nbsp;19. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and is very reactive with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite the hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac flame.</p>\n<p>Because potassium and sodium are chemically very similar, their salts were not at first differentiated. The existence of multiple elements in their salts was suspected from 1702, and this was proven in 1807 when potassium and sodium were individually isolated from different salts by electrolysis. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. As such, it is found dissolved in seawater (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals.</p>\n<p>Most industrial chemical applications of potassium employ the relatively high solubility in water of potassium compounds, such as potassium soaps. Potassium metal has only a few special applications, being replaced in most chemical reactions with sodium metal.</p>\n<p>Potassium ions are necessary for the function of all living cells. Potassium ion diffusion is a key mechanism in nerve transmission, and potassium depletion in animals, including humans, results in various cardiac dysfunctions. Potassium accumulates in plant cells, and thus fresh fruits and vegetables are a good dietary source of it. Conversely, most plants except specialist halophytes are intolerant of salt, and sodium is present in them only in low concentration. This resulted in potassium first being isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, giving the element its name. For the same reason, heavy crop production rapidly depletes soils of potassium, and agricultural fertilizers consume 95% of global potassium chemical production.</p>\n\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe flame test of potassium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Potassium atoms have 19 electrons, which is one more than the extremely stable configuration of argon. A potassium atom is thus much more likely to lose the \"extra\" electron than to gain one; however, the alkalide ions, K, are known. Because of the low first ionization energy (418.8 kJ/mol) the potassium atom easily loses an electron and oxidizes into the monopositive cation, K. This process requires so little energy that potassium is readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (3052 kJ/mol), because removal of two electrons breaks the stable noble gas electronic configuration. Potassium therefore does not readily form compounds with the oxidation state of +2 (or higher).</p>\n<p>Potassium is the second least dense metal after lithium. It is a soft solid that has a low melting point and can easily be cut with a knife. Freshly cut potassium is silvery in appearance, but it begins to tarnish toward gray immediately after being exposed to air. In a flame test, potassium and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of 766.5&nbsp;nm (see movie below).</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<p>Potassium is an extremely active metal, which reacts violently with oxygen and water in air. With oxygen, it converts to potassium peroxide and with water potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent exothermic character and the production of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and its liquid alloy with sodium — NaK — are potent desiccants that can be used to dry solvents prior to distillation.</p>\n<p>Because of the sensitivity of potassium to water and air, the reactions are possible only in inert atmosphere, such as argon gas using air-free techniques. Potassium does not react with most hydrocarbons, such as mineral oil or kerosene. It readily dissolves in liquid ammonia, up to 480 g per 1000 g of ammonia at 0 °C. Depending on the concentration, the ammonia solutions are blue to yellow, and their electrical conductivity is similar to that of liquid metals. In a pure solution, potassium slowly reacts with ammonia to form KNH, but this reaction is accelerated by minute amounts of transition metal salts. It can reduce the salts to the metal; potassium is often used as the reductant in the preparation of finely divided metals from their salts by the Rieke method. For example, the preparation of Rieke magnesium employs potassium as the reductant:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>MgCl + 2 K → Mg + 2 KCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<p>The only common oxidation state for potassium is +1. Potassium metal is a powerful reducing agent that is easily oxidized to the monopositive cation, K. Once oxidized, it is very stable and difficult to reduce back to the metal.</p>\n<p>Potassium hydroxide reacts readily with carbon dioxide to produce potassium carbonate, and is used to remove traces of the gas from air. In general, potassium compounds have excellent water solubility, owing to the high hydration energy of the K ion. The potassium ion is colorless in water and is very difficult to precipitate; possible precipitation methods include reactions with sodium tetraphenylborate, hexachloroplatinic acid, and sodium cobaltinitrite.</p>\n<p>Potassium oxidizes faster than most metals and forms oxides with oxygen-oxygen bonds, as do all alkali metals except lithium. Three species are formed during the reaction: potassium oxide, potassium peroxide, and potassium superoxide, which contain three different oxygen-based ions: oxide (O2−), peroxide (O2−\n2), and superoxide (O−\n2). The last two species, especially the superoxide, are rare and are formed only in reaction with very electropositive metals; these species contain oxygen-oxygen bonds. All potassium-oxygen binary compounds are known to react with water violently, forming potassium hydroxide. This compound is a very strong alkali, and 1.21&nbsp;kg of it can dissolve as much as a liter of water.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of solid potassium superoxide (KO).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4>In aqueous solution</h4>\n<p>Potassium compounds are typically highly ionic and thus most of them are soluble in water. The main species in water are the aquo complexes [K(HO)] where n = 6 and 7. Some of the few salts that are poorly soluble include potassium tetraphenylborate, potassium hexachloroplatinate, and potassium cobaltinitrite.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of potassium</div>\n<p>There are 24 known isotopes of potassium, three of which occur naturally: K (93.3%), K (0.0117%), and K (6.7%). Naturally occurring K has a half-life of 1.250×10 years. It decays to stable Ar by electron capture or positron emission (11.2%) or to stable Ca by beta decay (88.8%). The decay of K to Ar enables a commonly used method for dating rocks. The conventional K-Ar dating method depends on the assumption that the rocks contained no argon at the time of formation and that all the subsequent radiogenic argon (i.e., Ar) was quantitatively retained. Minerals are dated by measurement of the concentration of potassium and the amount of radiogenic Ar that has accumulated. The minerals that are best suited for dating include biotite, muscovite, metamorphic hornblende, and volcanic feldspar; whole rock samples from volcanic flows and shallow instrusives can also be dated if they are unaltered. Outside of dating, potassium isotopes have been used as tracers in studies of weathering and for nutrient cycling studies because potassium is a macronutrient required for life.</p>\n<p>K occurs in natural potassium (and thus in some commercial salt substitutes) in sufficient quantity that large bags of those substitutes can be used as a radioactive source for classroom demonstrations. In healthy animals and people, K represents the largest source of radioactivity, greater even than C. In a human body of 70&nbsp;kg mass, about 4,400 nuclei of K decay per second. The activity of natural potassium is 31 Bq/g.</p>\n<h3>Creation and occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also categories: Potassium minerals&nbsp;and Potassium compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPotassium in feldspar</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Potassium is formed in the universe by nucleosynthesis from lighter atoms. The stable form of potassium is created in supernovas via the explosive oxygen-burning process.</p>\n<p>Elemental potassium does not occur in nature because it reacts violently with water (see section Precautions below). As various compounds, potassium makes up about 2.6% of the weight of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element, similar in abundance to sodium at approximately 1.8% of the crust. In seawater, potassium at 0.39&nbsp;g/L (0.039 wt/v%) is far less abundant than sodium at 10.8&nbsp;g/L (1.08 wt/v%).</p>\n<p>Orthoclase (potassium feldspar) is a common rock-forming mineral. Granite for example contains 5% potassium, which is well above the average in the Earth's crust. Sylvite (KCl), carnallite (KCl·MgCl·6(HO)), kainite (MgSO·KCl·3HO) and langbeinite (MgSO·KSO)) are the minerals found in large evaporite deposits worldwide. The deposits often show layers starting with the least soluble at the bottom and the most soluble on top. Deposits of niter (potassium nitrate) are formed by decomposition of organic material in contact with atmosphere, mostly in caves; because of the good water solubility of niter the formation of larger deposits requires special environmental conditions.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Neither elemental potassium nor potassium salts (as separate entities from other salts) were known in Roman times, and the Latin name of the element, <i>kallium</i>, is not Classical Latin but rather neo-Latin. <b>Kalium</b> was taken from the word \"alkali\", which in turn came from <i>Arabic: القَلْيَه‎</i> <i>al-qalyah</i> \"plant ashes.\" The similar-sounding English term alkali is from this same root – potassium in Modern Standard Arabic is <big>بوتاسيوم</big> <i>būtāsyūm</i>.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHumphry Davy</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The English name for the element <i>potassium</i> comes from the word \"potash\", and refers to the method by which potash was obtained – leaching the ash of burnt wood or tree leaves and evaporating the solution in a pot. Potash is primarily a mixture of potassium salts because plants have little or no sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.</p>\n<p>Potassium <i>metal</i> was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly discovered voltaic pile. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (caustic soda, NaOH, or lye) rather than a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating that the elements, and thus the salts, are different. Although the production of potassium and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements, it took some time before this view was universally accepted.</p>\n<p>For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized, as they tended to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and were known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.</p>\n<h2>Commercial production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSylvite from New Mexico</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Potassium salts such as carnallite, langbeinite, polyhalite, and sylvite form extensive deposits in ancient lake and seabeds, making extraction of potassium salts in these environments commercially viable. The principal source of potassium – potash – is mined in Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, Jordan, and other places around the world. The first mined deposits were located near Staßfurt, Germany, but the deposits span from Great Britain over Germany into Poland. They are located in the Zechstein and were deposited in the Middle to Late Permian. The largest deposits ever found lie 1000 meters (3000&nbsp;feet) below the surface of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The deposits are located in the Elk Point Group produced in the Middle Devonian. Saskatchewan, where several large mines have operated since the 1960s, pioneered the use of freezing of wet sands (the Blairmore formation) in order to drive mine shafts through them. The main potash mining company in Saskatchewan is the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The water of the Dead Sea is used by Israel and Jordan as a source for potash, while the concentration in normal oceans is too low for commercial production at current prices.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMining and beneficiation waste heaps from potash mining in Germany, consisting mostly of sodium chloride.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Several methods are applied to separate the potassium salts from the present sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is to precipitate some compounds relying on the solubility difference of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium minerals end up as potassium chloride after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.</p>\n<p>Pure potassium metal can be isolated by electrolysis of its hydroxide in a process that has changed little since Davy. Although the electrolysis process was developed and used in industrial scale in the 1920s the thermal method by reacting sodium with potassium chloride in a chemical equilibrium reaction became the dominant method in the 1950s. The production of sodium potassium alloys is possible by changing the reaction time and the amount of sodium used in the reaction. The Griesheimer process employing the reaction of potassium fluoride with calcium carbide was also used to produce potassium.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Na + KCl → NaCl + K &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (Thermal method)</dd>\n<dd>2 KF + CaC → 2 K + CaF + 2 C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Griesheimer process)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Reagent-grade potassium metal cost about $10.00/pound ($22/kg) in 2010 when purchased in tonne quantities. Lower purity metal is considerably cheaper. The market is volatile due to the difficulty of the long-term storage of the metal. It must be stored under a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent the formation of a surface layer of potassium superoxide. This superoxide is a pressure-sensitive explosive that will detonate when scratched. The resulting explosion will usually start a fire that is difficult to extinguish.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>Main article: Potassium in biology</div>\n<h3>Biochemical function</h3>\n<div>Main article: Action potential</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe action of the sodium-potassium pump is an example of primary active transport. The two carrier proteins on the left are using ATP to move sodium out of the cell against the concentration gradient. The proteins on the right are using secondary active transport to move potassium into the cell.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Potassium is the eighth or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) in the human body, so that a 60&nbsp;kg adult contains a total of about 120&nbsp;g of potassium. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only the major minerals calcium and phosphorus are more abundant.</p>\n<p>Potassium cations are important in neuron (brain and nerve) function, and in influencing osmotic balance between cells and the interstitial fluid, with their distribution mediated in all animals (but not in all plants) by the so-called Na+/K+-ATPase pump. This ion pump uses ATP to pump three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell, thus creating an electrochemical gradient over the cell membrane. In addition, the highly selective potassium ion channels (which are tetramers) are crucial for the hyperpolarization, in for example neurons, after an action potential is fired. The most recently resolved potassium ion channel is KirBac3.1, which gives a total of five potassium ion channels (KcsA, KirBac1.1, KirBac3.1, KvAP, and MthK) with a determined structure. All five are from prokaryotic species.</p>\n<p>Potassium can be detected by taste because it triggers three of the five types of taste sensations, according to concentration. Dilute solutions of potassium ions taste sweet, allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices, while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter/alkaline, and finally also salty to the taste. The combined bitterness and saltiness of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.</p>\n<h3>Membrane polarization</h3>\n<p>Potassium is also important in preventing muscle contraction and the sending of all nerve impulses in animals through action potentials. By nature of their electrostatic and chemical properties, K ions are larger than Na ions, and ion channels and pumps in cell membranes can distinguish between the two types of ions, actively pumping or passively allowing one of the two ions to pass, while blocking the other.</p>\n<p>A shortage of potassium in body fluids may cause a potentially fatal condition known as hypokalemia, typically resulting from vomiting, diarrhea, and/or increased diuresis. Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response and in severe cases respiratory paralysis, alkalosis and cardiac arrhythmia.</p>\n<h3>Filtration and excretion</h3>\n<p>Potassium is an essential macromineral in human nutrition; it is the major cation (positive ion) inside animal cells, and it is thus important in maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance in the body. Sodium makes up most of the cations of blood plasma at a reference range of about 145&nbsp;mmol/L (3.345&nbsp;g)(1&nbsp;mmol/L = 1mEq/L), and potassium makes up most of the cell fluid cations at about 150&nbsp;mmol/L (4.8&nbsp;g). Plasma is filtered through the glomerulus of the kidneys in enormous amounts, about 180&nbsp;liters per day. Thus 602&nbsp;g of sodium and 33&nbsp;g of potassium are filtered each day. All but the 1–10&nbsp;g of sodium and the 1–4&nbsp;g of potassium likely to be in the diet must be reabsorbed. Sodium must be reabsorbed in such a way as to keep the blood volume exactly right and the osmotic pressure correct; potassium must be reabsorbed in such a way as to keep serum concentration as close as possible to 4.8&nbsp;mmol/L (about 0.190&nbsp;g/L). Sodium pumps in the kidneys must always operate to conserve sodium. Potassium must sometimes be conserved also, but, as the amount of potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large, the situation is not so critical for potassium. Since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium in response to an apparent (but not actual) Donnan equilibrium, the urine can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water at the end of the processing. Potassium is secreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules. At that point, it usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma. At the end of the processing, potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high.</p>\n<p>If potassium were removed from the diet, there would remain a minimum obligatory kidney excretion of about 200&nbsp;mg per day when the serum declines to 3.0–3.5&nbsp;mmol/L in about one week, and can never be cut off completely, resulting in hypokalemia and even death.</p>\n<p>The potassium moves passively through pores in the cell membrane. When ions move through pumps there is a gate in the pumps on either side of the cell membrane and only one gate can be open at once. As a result, approximately 100 ions are forced through per second. Pores have only one gate, and there only one kind of ion can stream through, at 10 million to 100 million ions per second. The pores require calcium in order to open although it is thought that the calcium works in reverse by blocking at least one of the pores. Carbonyl groups inside the pore on the amino acids mimic the water hydration that takes place in water solution by the nature of the electrostatic charges on four carbonyl groups inside the pore.</p>\n<h3>In diet</h3>\n<h4>Adequate intake</h4>\n<p>A potassium intake sufficient to support life can in general be guaranteed by eating a variety of foods. Clear cases of potassium deficiency (as defined by symptoms, signs and a below-normal blood level of the element) are rare in healthy individuals. Foods rich in potassium include parsley, dried apricots, dried milk, chocolate, various nuts (especially almonds and pistachios), potatoes, bamboo shoots, bananas, avocados, soybeans, and bran, although it is also present in sufficient quantities in most fruits, vegetables, meat and fish.</p>\n<h4>Optimal intake</h4>\n<p>Epidemiological studies and studies in animals subject to hypertension indicate that diets high in potassium can reduce the risk of hypertension and possibly stroke (by a mechanism independent of blood pressure), and a potassium deficiency combined with an inadequate thiamine intake has produced heart disease in rats. There is some debate regarding the optimal amount of dietary potassium. For example, the 2004 guidelines of the Institute of Medicine specify a DRI of 4,000&nbsp;mg of potassium (100&nbsp;mEq), though most Americans consume only half that amount per day, which would make them formally deficient as regards this particular recommendation. Likewise, in the European Union, in particular in Germany and Italy, insufficient potassium intake is somewhat common. Italian researchers reported in a 2011 meta-analysis that a 1.64&nbsp;g higher daily intake of potassium was associated with a 21% lower risk of stroke.</p>\n<h4>Medical supplementation and disease</h4>\n<p>Supplements of potassium in medicine are most widely used in conjunction with loop diuretics and thiazides, classes of diuretics that rid the body of sodium and water, but have the side-effect of also causing potassium loss in urine. A variety of medical and non-medical supplements are available. Potassium salts such as potassium chloride may be dissolved in water, but the salty/bitter taste of high concentrations of potassium ion make palatable high concentration liquid supplements difficult to formulate. Typical medical supplemental doses range from 10&nbsp;mmol (400&nbsp;mg, about equal to a cup of milk or 6&nbsp;US&nbsp;fl&nbsp;oz (180&nbsp;ml). of orange juice) to 20&nbsp;mmol (800&nbsp;mg) per dose. Potassium salts are also available in tablets or capsules, which for therapeutic purposes are formulated to allow potassium to leach slowly out of a matrix, as very high concentrations of potassium ion (which might occur next to a solid tablet of potassium chloride) can kill tissue, and cause injury to the gastric or intestinal mucosa. For this reason, non-prescription supplement potassium pills are limited by law in the US to only 99&nbsp;mg of potassium.</p>\n<p>Individuals suffering from kidney diseases may suffer adverse health effects from consuming large quantities of dietary potassium. End stage renal failure patients undergoing therapy by renal dialysis must observe strict dietary limits on potassium intake, as the kidneys control potassium excretion, and buildup of blood concentrations of potassium (hyperkalemia) may trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmia.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Fertilizer</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPotassium and magnesium sulfate fertilizer</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Potassium ions are an essential component of plant nutrition and are found in most soil types. They are used as a fertilizer in agriculture, horticulture, and hydroponic culture in the form of chloride (KCl), sulfate (K\n2SO\n4), or nitrate (KNO\n3). Agricultural fertilizers consume 95% of global potassium chemical production, and about 90% of this potassium is supplied as KCl. The potassium content of most plants range from 0.5% to 2% of the harvested weight of crops, conventionally expressed as amount of K\n2O. Modern high-yield agriculture depends upon fertilizers to replace the potassium lost at harvest. Most agricultural fertilizers contain potassium chloride, while potassium sulfate is used for chloride-sensitive crops or crops needing higher sulfur content. The sulfate is produced mostly by decomposition of the complex minerals kainite (MgSO·KCl·3HO) and langbeinite (MgSO·KSO). Only a very few fertilizers contain potassium nitrate. In 2005, about 93% of world potassium production was consumed by the fertilizer industry.</p>\n<h3>Food</h3>\n<p>The potassium cation is a nutrient necessary for human life and health. Potassium chloride is used as a substitute for table salt by those seeking to reduce sodium intake so as to control hypertension. The USDA lists tomato paste, orange juice, beet greens, white beans, potatoes, bananas and many other good dietary sources of potassium, ranked in descending order according to potassium content.</p>\n<p>Potassium sodium tartrate (KNaCHO, Rochelle salt) is the main constituent of baking powder; it is also used in the silvering of mirrors. Potassium bromate (KBrO\n3) is a strong oxidizer (E924), used to improve dough strength and rise height. Potassium bisulfite (KHSO\n3) is used as a food preservative, for example in wine and beer-making (but not in meats). It is also used to bleach textiles and straw, and in the tanning of leathers.</p>\n<h3>Industrial</h3>\n<p>Major potassium chemicals are potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium sulfate, and potassium chloride. Megatons of these compounds are produced annually.</p>\n<p>Potassium hydroxide KOH is a strong base, which is used in industry to neutralize strong and weak acids, to control pH and to manufacture potassium salts. It is also used to saponify fats and oils, in industrial cleaners, and in hydrolysis reactions, for example of esters.</p>\n<p>Potassium nitrate (KNO) or saltpeter is obtained from natural sources such as guano and evaporites or manufactured via the Haber process; it is the oxidant in gunpowder (black powder) and an important agricultural fertilizer. Potassium cyanide (KCN) is used industrially to dissolve copper and precious metals, in particular silver and gold, by forming complexes. Its applications include gold mining, electroplating, and electroforming of these metals; it is also used in organic synthesis to make nitriles. Potassium carbonate (K\n2CO\n3 or potash) is used in the manufacture of glass, soap, color TV tubes, fluorescent lamps, textile dyes and pigments. Potassium permanganate (KMnO) is an oxidizing, bleaching and purification substance and is used for production of saccharin. Potassium chlorate (KClO) is added to matches and explosives. Potassium bromide (KBr) was formerly used as a sedative and in photography.</p>\n<p>Potassium chromate (KCrO) is used in inks, dyes, stains (bright yellowish-red color); in explosives and fireworks; in the tanning of leather, in fly paper and safety matches, but all these uses are due to the properties of chromate ion containment rather than potassium ions.</p>\n<h4>Niche uses</h4>\n<p>Potassium compounds are so pervasive that thousands of small uses are in place. The superoxide KO is an orange solid that acts as a portable source of oxygen and a carbon dioxide absorber. It is widely used in respiration systems in mines, submarines and spacecraft as it takes less volume than the gaseous oxygen.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4&nbsp;KO + 2&nbsp;CO → 2&nbsp;KCO + 3&nbsp;O</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Potassium cobaltinitrite K[Co(NO)] is used as artist's pigment under the name of Aureolin or Cobalt Yellow.</p>\n<h4>Laboratory uses</h4>\n<p>An alloy of sodium and potassium, NaK is a liquid used as a heat-transfer medium and a desiccant for producing dry and air-free solvents. It can also be used in reactive distillation. The ternary alloy of 12% Na, 47% K and 41% Cs has the lowest melting point of −78 °C of any metallic compound.</p>\n<p>Metallic potassium is used in several types of magnetometers.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-videopayload=\"&lt;div class=&quot;mediaContainer&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;width:640px&quot;&gt;&lt;video id=&quot;mwe_player_1&quot; style=&quot;width:640px;height:480px&quot; poster=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv/640px--Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv.jpg&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;kskin&quot; data-durationhint=&quot;5.6656689342404&quot; data-startoffset=&quot;0&quot; data-mwtitle=&quot;Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv&quot; data-mwprovider=&quot;wikimediacommons&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/4/43/Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv/Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv.360p.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm; codecs=&amp;quot;vp8, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; transcodekey=&quot;360p.webm&quot; data-title=&quot;Web streamable WebM (360P)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;WebM 360P&quot; data-width=&quot;480&quot; data-height=&quot;360&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;576808&quot; data-framerate=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/4/43/Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv/Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv.480p.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg; codecs=&amp;quot;theora, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; transcodekey=&quot;480p.ogv&quot; data-title=&quot;Web streamable Ogg video (480P)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;Ogg 480P&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;480&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;1004376&quot; data-framerate=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/4/43/Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv/Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv.480p.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm; codecs=&amp;quot;vp8, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; transcodekey=&quot;480p.webm&quot; data-title=&quot;Web streamable WebM (480P)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;WebM 480P&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;480&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;1084136&quot; data-framerate=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg; codecs=&amp;quot;theora, vorbis&amp;quot;&quot; data-title=&quot;Original Ogg file, 640 × 480 (1.16 Mbps)&quot; data-shorttitle=&quot;Ogg source&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;480&quot; data-bandwidth=&quot;1156757&quot; data-framerate=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.&lt;br /&gt;\nYou can &lt;a href=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv&quot;&gt;download the clip&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TimedMediaHandler/Client_download&quot;&gt;download a player&lt;/a&gt; to play the clip in your browser.&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA reaction of potassium metal with water. Hydrogen is liberated that burns with a pink or lilac flame, the flame color owing to burning potassium vapor. Strongly alkaline potassium hydroxide is formed in solution.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Potassium reacts very violently with water producing potassium hydroxide (KOH) and hydrogen gas.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 K (s) + 2 HO (l) → 2 KOH (aq) + H↑ (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen. It in turn may explode in the presence of oxygen. Potassium hydroxide is a strong alkali that causes skin burns. Finely divided potassium will ignite in air at room temperature. The bulk metal will ignite in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.</p>\n<p>Potassium reacts violently with halogens and will detonate in the presence of bromine. It also reacts explosively with sulfuric acid. During combustion potassium forms peroxides and superoxides. These peroxides may react violently with organic compounds such as oils. Both peroxides and superoxides may react explosively with metallic potassium.</p>\n<p>Because potassium reacts with water vapor present in the air, it is usually stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under the lid of the container, and can detonate upon opening.</p>\n<p>Because of the highly reactive nature of potassium metal, it must be handled with great care, with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal. Ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system. Potassium chloride is used in the United States for executions via lethal injection.</p>\n"

Brick-red color originates from calcium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In chemical terms, calcium is reactive and soft for a metal (though harder than lead, it can be cut with a knife with difficulty). It is a silvery metallic element that must be extracted by electrolysis from a fused salt like calcium chloride. Once produced, it rapidly forms a gray-white oxide and nitride coating when exposed to air. In bulk form (typically as chips or \"turnings\"), the metal is somewhat difficult to ignite, more so even than magnesium chips; but, when lit, the metal burns in air with a brilliant high-intensity orange-red light. Calcium metal reacts with water, generating hydrogen gas at a rate rapid enough to be noticeable, but not fast enough at room temperature to generate much heat, making it useful for generating hydrogen. In powdered form, however, the reaction with water is extremely rapid, as the increased surface area of the powder accelerates the reaction with the water. Part of the slowness of the calcium–water reaction results from the metal being partly protected by insoluble white calcium hydroxide. In water solutions of acids, where this salt is soluble, calcium reacts vigorously.</p>\n<p>Calcium, with a density of 1.55 g/cm, is the lightest of the alkaline earth metals; magnesium (specific gravity 1.74) and beryllium (1.84) are more dense, although lighter in atomic mass. From strontium onward, the alkali earth metals become more dense with increasing atomic mass.</p>\n<p>It has two allotropes.</p>\n<p>Calcium has a higher electrical resistivity than copper or aluminium, yet weight-for-weight, due to its much lower density, it is a rather better conductor than either. However, its use in terrestrial applications is usually limited by its high reactivity with air.</p>\n<p>Calcium salts are colorless from any contribution of the calcium, and ionic solutions of calcium (Ca) are colorless as well. As with magnesium salts and other alkaline earth metal salts, calcium salts are often quite soluble in water. Notable exceptions include the hydroxide, the sulfate (unusual for sulfate salts), the carbonate and the phosphates. With the exception of the sulfate, even the insoluble ones listed are in general more soluble than its transition metal counterparts. When in solution, the calcium ion to the human taste varies remarkably, being reported as mildly salty, sour, \"mineral like\" or even \"soothing.\" It is apparent that many animals can taste, or develop a taste, for calcium, and use this sense to detect the mineral in salt licks or other sources. In human nutrition, soluble calcium salts may be added to tart juices without much effect to the average palate.</p>\n<p>Calcium is the fifth-most-abundant element by mass in the human body, where it is a common cellular ionic messenger with many functions, and serves also as a structural element in bone. It is the relatively high-atomic-number calcium in the skeleton that causes bone to be radio-opaque. Of the human body's solid components after drying and burning of organics (as for example, after cremation), about a third of the total \"mineral\" mass remaining, is the approximately one kilogram of calcium that composes the average skeleton (the remainder being mostly phosphorus and oxygen).</p>\n<h3>H and K lines</h3>\n<p>Visible spectra of many stars, including the Sun, exhibit strong absorption lines of singly ionized calcium. Prominent among these are the H-line at 3968.5&nbsp;Å and the K line at 3933.7&nbsp;Å of singly ionized calcium, or Ca&nbsp;II. For the Sun and stars with low temperatures, the prominence of the H and K lines can be an indication of strong magnetic activity in the chromosphere. Measurement of periodic variations of these active regions can also be used to deduce the rotation periods of these stars.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<p>Calcium, combined with phosphate to form hydroxylapatite, is the mineral portion of human and animal bones and teeth. The mineral portion of some corals can also be transformed into hydroxylapatite.</p>\n<p>Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) is used in many chemical refinery processes and is made by heating limestone at high temperature (above 825&nbsp;°C) and then carefully adding water to it. When lime is mixed with sand, it hardens into a mortar and is turned into plaster by carbon dioxide uptake. Mixed with other compounds, lime forms an important part of Portland cement.</p>\n<p>Calcium carbonate (CaCO) is one of the common compounds of calcium. It is heated to form quicklime (CaO), which is then added to water (HO). This forms another material known as slaked lime (Ca(OH)), which is an inexpensive base material used throughout the chemical industry. Chalk, marble, and limestone are all forms of calcium carbonate.</p>\n<p>When water percolates through limestone or other soluble carbonate rocks, it partially dissolves the rock and causes cave formation and characteristic stalactites and stalagmites and also forms hard water. Other important calcium compounds are calcium nitrate, calcium sulfide, calcium chloride, calcium carbide, calcium cyanamide and calcium hypochlorite.</p>\n<p>A few calcium compounds in the oxidation state +1 have also been investigated recently.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of calcium</div>\n<p>Calcium has four stable isotopes (Ca, Ca, Ca and Ca), plus two more isotopes (Ca and Ca) that have such long half-lives that for all practical purposes they also can be considered stable. The 20% range in relative mass among naturally occurring calcium isotopes is greater than for any other element except hydrogen and helium. Calcium also has a cosmogenic isotope, radioactive Ca, which has a half-life of 103,000 years. Unlike cosmogenic isotopes that are produced in the atmosphere, Ca is produced by neutron activation of Ca. Most of its production is in the upper metre or so of the soil column, where the cosmogenic neutron flux is still sufficiently strong. Ca has received much attention in stellar studies because it decays to K, a critical indicator of solar-system anomalies.</p>\n<p>Ninety-seven percent of naturally occurring calcium is in the form of Ca. Ca is one of the daughter products of K decay, along with Ar. While K-Ar dating has been used extensively in the geological sciences, the prevalence of Ca in nature has impeded its use in dating. Techniques using mass spectrometry and a double spike isotope dilution have been used for K-Ca age dating.</p>\n<p>The most abundant isotope, Ca, has a nucleus of 20 protons and 20 neutrons. This is the heaviest stable isotope of any element that has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. In supernova explosions, calcium is formed from the reaction of carbon with various numbers of alpha particles (helium nuclei), until the most common calcium isotope (containing 10 helium nuclei) has been synthesized.</p>\n<h3>Isotope fractionation</h3>\n<p>As with the isotopes of other elements, a variety of processes fractionate, or alter the relative abundance of, calcium isotopes. The best studied of these processes is the mass-dependent fractionation of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals, such as calcite, aragonite and apatite, from solution. Isotopically light calcium is preferentially incorporated into minerals, leaving the solution from which the mineral precipitated enriched in isotopically heavy calcium. At room temperature the magnitude of this fractionation is roughly 0.25‰ (0.025%) per atomic mass unit (AMU). Mass-dependent differences in calcium isotope composition conventionally are expressed the ratio of two isotopes (usually Ca/Ca) in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material. Ca/Ca varies by about 1% among common earth materials.</p>\n<p>Calcium isotope fractionation during mineral formation has led to several applications of calcium isotopes. In particular, the 1997 observation by Skulan and DePaolo that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate is the basis of analogous applications in medicine and in paleooceanography. In animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral. In humans changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine have been shown to be related to changes in bone mineral balance. When the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption, soft tissue Ca/Ca rises. Soft tissue Ca/Ca falls when bone resorption exceeds bone formation. Because of this relationship, calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like osteoporosis.</p>\n<p>A similar system exists in the ocean, where seawater Ca/Ca tends to rise when the rate of removal of Ca from seawater by mineral precipitation exceeds the input of new calcium into the ocean, and fall when calcium input exceeds mineral precipitation. It follows that rising Ca/Ca corresponds to falling seawater Ca concentration, and falling Ca/Ca corresponds to rising seawater Ca concentration. In 1997 Skulan and DePaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater Ca/Ca over geologic time, along with a theoretical explanation of these changes. More recent papers have confirmed this observation, demonstrating that seawater Ca concentration is not constant, and that the ocean probably never is in “steady state” with respect to its calcium input and output. This has important climatological implications, as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the carbon cycle (see below).</p>\n<h2>Geochemical cycling</h2>\n<p>Calcium provides an important link between tectonics, climate and the carbon cycle. In the simplest terms, uplift of mountains exposes Ca-bearing rocks to chemical weathering and releases Ca into surface water. This Ca eventually is transported to the ocean where it reacts with dissolved CO to form limestone. Some of this limestone settles to the sea floor where it is incorporated into new rocks. Dissolved CO, along with carbonate and bicarbonate ions, are referred to as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTravertine terraces Pamukkale, Turkey</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The actual reaction is more complicated and involves the bicarbonate ion (HCO) that forms when CO reacts with water at seawater pH:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Ca2+ + 2HCO−\n3 → CaCO\n3 (limestone) + CO\n2 + H\n2O</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Note that at ocean pH most of the CO produced in this reaction is immediately converted back into HCO−\n3. The reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of CO from the ocean/atmosphere into the lithosphere.</p>\n<p>The result is that each Ca ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one CO molecule from the surficial system (atmosphere, ocean, soils and living organisms), storing it in carbonate rocks where it is likely to stay for hundreds of millions of years. The weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs CO from the ocean and atmosphere, exerting a strong long-term effect on climate. Analogous cycles involving magnesium, and to a much smaller extent strontium and barium, have the same effect.</p>\n<p>As the weathering of limestone (CaCO) liberates equimolar amounts of Ca and CO, it has no net effect on the CO content of the atmosphere and ocean. The weathering of silicate rocks like granite, on the other hand, is a net CO sink because it produces abundant Ca but very little CO.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Lime as building material was used since prehistoric times going as far back as 7000 to 14000&nbsp;BC. The first dated lime kiln dates back to 2500&nbsp;BC and was found in Khafajah mesopotamia. Calcium (from Latin calx, genitive <i>calcis</i>, meaning \"lime\") was known as early as the first century when the Ancient Romans prepared lime as calcium oxide. Literature dating back to 975 AD notes that plaster of paris (calcium sulfate), is useful for setting broken bones. It was not isolated until 1808 in England when Sir Humphry Davy electrolyzed a mixture of lime and mercuric oxide. Davy was trying to isolate calcium; when he heard that Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Pontin prepared calcium amalgam by electrolyzing lime in mercury, he tried it himself. He worked with electrolysis throughout his life and also discovered/isolated sodium, potassium, magnesium, boron and barium. Calcium metal was not available in large scale until the beginning of the 20th century.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>See also category: Calcium minerals</div>\n<p>Calcium is not naturally found in its elemental state. Calcium occurs most commonly in sedimentary rocks in the minerals calcite, dolomite and gypsum. It also occurs in igneous and metamorphic rocks chiefly in the silicate minerals: plagioclases, amphiboles, pyroxenes and garnets.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Calcium is used</p>\n<ul>\n<li>as a reducing agent in the extraction of other metals, such as uranium, zirconium, and thorium.</li>\n<li>as a deoxidizer, desulfurizer, or decarbonizer for various ferrous and nonferrous alloys.</li>\n<li>as an alloying agent used in the production of aluminium, beryllium, copper, lead, and magnesium alloys.</li>\n<li>in the making of cements and mortars to be used in construction.</li>\n<li>in the making of cheese, where calcium ions influence the activity of rennin in bringing about the coagulation of milk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Calcium compounds</h3>\n<div>See also category: Calcium compounds</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Calcium carbonate (CaCO) is used in manufacturing cement and mortar, lime, limestone (usually used in the steel industry) and aids in production in the glass industry.

The National Osteoporosis Foundation says, \"Calcium plays an important role in building stronger, denser bones early in life and keeping bones strong and healthy later in life.\" Approximately 99 percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth. The rest of the calcium in the body has other important uses, such as some exocytosis, especially neurotransmitter release, and muscle contraction. In the electrical conduction system of the heart, calcium replaces sodium as the mineral that depolarizes the cell, proliferating the action potential. In cardiac muscle, sodium influx commences an action potential, but during potassium efflux, the cardiac myocyte experiences calcium influx, prolonging the action potential and creating a plateau phase of dynamic equilibrium. Long-term calcium deficiency can lead to rickets and poor blood clotting and in case of a menopausal woman, it can lead to osteoporosis, in which the bone deteriorates and there is an increased risk of fractures. While a lifelong deficit can affect bone and tooth formation, over-retention can cause hypercalcemia (elevated levels of calcium in the blood), impaired kidney function and decreased absorption of other minerals. Several sources suggest a correlation between high calcium intake (2000&nbsp;mg per day, or twice the U.S. recommended daily allowance, equivalent to six or more glasses of milk per day) and prostate cancer. High calcium intakes or high calcium absorption were previously thought to contribute to the development of kidney stones. However, a high calcium intake has been associated with a lower risk for kidney stones in more recent research. Vitamin D is needed to absorb calcium.</p>\n<p>Dairy products, such as milk and cheese, are a well-known source of calcium. Some individuals are allergic to dairy products and even more people, in particular those of non Indo-European descent, are lactose-intolerant, leaving them unable to consume non-fermented dairy products in quantities larger than about half a liter per serving. Others, such as vegans, avoid dairy products for ethical and health reasons.</p>\n<p>Many good vegetable sources of calcium exist, including seaweeds such as kelp, wakame and hijiki; nuts and seeds like almonds, hazelnuts, sesame, and pistachio; blackstrap molasses; beans (especially soy beans); figs; quinoa; okra; rutabaga; broccoli; dandelion leaves; and kale. In addition, for some drinks (like soy milk or orange juice) it is typical to be fortified with calcium.</p>\n<p>Numerous vegetables, notably spinach, chard and rhubarb have a high calcium content, but they may also contain varying amounts of oxalic acid that binds calcium and reduces its absorption. The same problem may to a degree affect the absorption of calcium from amaranth, collard greens, and chicory greens. This process may also be related to the generation of calcium oxalate.</p>\n<p>An overlooked source of calcium is eggshell, which can be ground into a powder and mixed into food or a glass of water.</p>\n<p>The calcium content of most foods can be found in the USDA National Nutrient Database.</p>\n<h3>Dietary supplements</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n500 milligram calcium supplements made from calcium carbonate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Calcium supplements are used to prevent and to treat calcium deficiencies. Most experts recommend that supplements be taken with food and that no more than 600&nbsp;mg should be taken at a time because the percent of calcium absorbed decreases as the amount of calcium in the supplement increases. It is recommended to spread doses throughout the day. Recommended daily calcium intake for adults ranges from 1000 to 1500&nbsp;mg. It is recommended to take supplements with food to aid in absorption.</p>\n<p>Vitamin D is added to some calcium supplements. Proper vitamin D status is important because vitamin D is converted to a hormone in the body, which then induces the synthesis of intestinal proteins responsible for calcium absorption.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The absorption of calcium from most food and commonly used dietary supplements is very similar. This is contrary to what many calcium supplement manufacturers claim in their promotional materials.</li>\n<li>Milk is an excellent source of dietary calcium for those whose bodies tolerate it because it has a high concentration of calcium and the calcium in milk is excellently absorbed.</li>\n<li>Soymilk and other vegetable milks are usually sold with calcium added so that their calcium concentration is as high as in milk.</li>\n<li>Also different kind of juices boosted with calcium are widely available.</li>\n<li>Calcium carbonate is the most common and least expensive calcium supplement. It should be taken with food, and depends on low pH levels (acidic) for proper absorption in the intestine. Some studies suggests that the absorption of calcium from calcium carbonate is similar to the absorption of calcium from milk. While most people digest calcium carbonate very well, some might develop gastrointestinal discomfort or gas. Taking magnesium with it can help to avoid constipation. Calcium carbonate is 40% elemental calcium. 1000&nbsp;mg will provide 400&nbsp;mg of calcium. However, supplement labels will usually indicate how much calcium is present in each serving, not how much calcium carbonate is present.</li>\n<li>Antacids frequently contain calcium carbonate, and are a commonly used, inexpensive calcium supplement.</li>\n<li>Coral calcium is a salt of calcium derived from fossilized coral reefs. Coral calcium is composed of calcium carbonate and trace minerals.</li>\n<li>Calcium citrate can be taken without food and is the supplement of choice for individuals with achlorhydria or who are taking histamine-2 blockers or proton-pump inhibitors. Calcium citrate is about 21% elemental calcium. 1000&nbsp;mg will provide 210&nbsp;mg of calcium. It is more expensive than calcium carbonate and more of it must be taken to get the same amount of calcium.</li>\n<li>Calcium phosphate costs more than calcium carbonate, but less than calcium citrate. Microcrystalline Hydroxyapatite (MH) is one of several forms of calcium phosphate used as a dietary supplement. Hydroxyapatite is about 40% calcium.</li>\n<li>Calcium lactate has similar absorption as calcium carbonate, but is more expensive. Calcium lactate and calcium gluconate are less concentrated forms of calcium and are not practical oral supplements.</li>\n<li>Calcium chelates are synthetic calcium compounds in which calcium is bound to an organic molecule, such as malate, aspartate, or fumarate. These forms of calcium may be better absorbed on an empty stomach. However, in general they are absorbed similarly to calcium carbonate and other common calcium supplements when taken with food. The \"chelate\" mimics the action that natural food performs by keeping the calcium soluble in the intestine. Thus, on an empty stomach, in some individuals, chelates might, in theory, be absorbed better.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A study investigating the effects of personal calcium supplement use on cardiovascular risk in the Women’s Health Initiative Calcium/Vitamin D Supplementation Study (WHI CaD Study) found a modestly increased risk of cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women. A broad recommendation of calcium/vitamin D supplements is therefore not warranted.</p>\n<h3>Osteoporosis</h3>\n<p>Such studies often do not test calcium alone, but rather combinations of calcium and vitamin D. Randomized controlled trials found both positive and negative effects. The different results may be explained by doses of calcium and underlying rates of calcium supplementation in the control groups.</p>\n<h3>Cancer</h3>\n<p>A meta-analysis by the international Cochrane Collaboration of two randomized controlled trials found that calcium \"might contribute to a moderate degree to the prevention of adenomatous colonic polyps\".</p>\n<p>More recent studies were conflicting, and one that was positive for effect (Lappe, et al.) did control for a possible anti-carcinogenic effect of vitamin D, which was found to be an independent positive influence from calcium-alone on cancer risk (see second study below).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A randomized controlled trial found that 1000&nbsp;mg of elemental calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D had no effect on colorectal cancer.</li>\n<li>A randomized controlled trial found that 1400–1500&nbsp;mg supplemental calcium and 1100 IU vitamin D reduced aggregated cancers with a relative risk of 0.402.</li>\n<li>An observational cohort study found that high calcium and vitamin D intake was associated with \"lower risk of developing premenopausal breast cancer.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hazards and toxicity</h2>\n<p>Compared with other metals, the calcium ion and most calcium compounds have low toxicity. This is not surprising given the very high natural abundance of calcium compounds in the environment and in organisms. Calcium poses few serious environmental problems, with kidney stones the most common side-effect in clinical studies. Acute calcium poisoning is rare, and difficult to achieve unless calcium compounds are administered intravenously. For example, the oral median lethal dose (LD) for rats for calcium carbonate and calcium chloride are 6.45 and 1.4&nbsp;g/kg, respectively.</p>\n<p>Calcium metal is hazardous because of its sometimes-violent reactions with water and acids. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (e.g., hair) that block drains. When swallowed calcium metal has the same effect on the mouth, esophagus and stomach, and can be fatal.</p>\n<p>Excessive consumption of calcium carbonate antacids/dietary supplements (such as Tums) over a period of weeks or months can cause milk-alkali syndrome, with symptoms ranging from hypercalcemia to potentially fatal renal failure. What constitutes “excessive” consumption is not well known and, it is presumed, varies a great deal from person to person. Persons consuming more than 10&nbsp;grams/day of CaCO (=4 g Ca) are at risk of developing milk-alkali syndrome, but the condition has been reported in at least one person consuming only 2.5&nbsp;grams/day of CaCO (=1 g Ca), an amount usually considered moderate and safe.</p>\n<p>Oral calcium supplements diminish the absorption of thyroxine when taken within four to six hours of each other. Thus, people taking both calcium and thyroxine run the risk of inadequate thyroid hormone replacement and thence hypothyroidism if they take them simultaneously or near-simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Excessive calcium supplementation can be detrimental to cardiovascular health, especially in men.</p>\n"

  "title": "Scandium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with Scandinavium.</div>\n<div>\"Element 21\" redirects here. For the golf company, see Element 21 (company).</div>\n\n<p><b>Scandium</b> is a chemical element with symbol <b>Sc</b> and atomic number 21. A silvery-white metallic transition metal, it has historically been sometimes classified as a rare earth element, together with yttrium and the lanthanoids. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia.</p>\n<p>Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, it took until the 1970s before applications for scandium were developed. The positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered in the 1970s, and its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of the pure metal is around a hundred pounds a year on average.</p>\n<p>The properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium. A diagonal relationship exists between the behavior of magnesium and scandium, just as there is between beryllium and aluminium. In the chemical compounds of the elements shown as group 3, above, the predominant oxidation state is +3.</p>\n\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<h3>Chemical characteristics of the element</h3>\n<p>Scandium is a soft metal with a silvery appearance. It develops a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It is susceptible to weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due to the formation of an impermeable passive layer.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of scandium</div>\n<p>Scandium exists naturally exclusively as the isotope Sc, which has a nuclear spin of 7/2. Thirteen radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being Sc with a half-life of 83.8&nbsp;days, Sc with a half-life of 3.35&nbsp;days, and Sc with a half-life of 43.7&nbsp;hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 4&nbsp;hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 2&nbsp;minutes. This element also has five meta states with the most stable being Sc (t = 58.6&nbsp;h).</p>\n<p>The isotopes of scandium range from Sc to Sc. The primary decay mode at masses lower than the only stable isotope, Sc, is electron capture, and the primary mode at masses above it is beta emission. The primary decay products at atomic weights below Sc are calcium isotopes and the primary products from higher atomic weights are titanium isotopes.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<p>In terms of earth's crust, scandium is not particularly rare. Estimates vary from 18 to 25&nbsp;ppm, which is comparable to the abundance of cobalt (20–30&nbsp;ppm). Scandium is only the 50th most common element on earth (35th most abundant in the crust), but it is the 23rd most common element in the Sun. However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, euxenite, and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide.</p>\n<p>The stable form of scandium is created in supernovas via the r-process.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>World production of scandium is in the order of 2 tonnes per year in the form of scandium oxide. The primary production is 400&nbsp;kg while the rest is from stockpiles of Russia generated during the Cold War. In 2003, only three mines produced scandium: the uranium and iron mines in Zhovti Vody in Ukraine, the rare earth mines in Bayan Obo, China and the apatite mines in the Kola peninsula, Russia. In each case, scandium is a byproduct from the extraction of other elements and is sold as scandium oxide.</p>\n<p>The production of metallic scandium is in the order of 10&nbsp;kg per year. The oxide is converted to scandium fluoride and reduced with metallic calcium.</p>\n<p>Madagascar and Iveland-Evje region in Norway have the only deposits of minerals with high scandium content, thortveitite (Sc,Y)(SiO) and kolbeckite ScPO·2HO, but these are not being exploited.</p>\n<p>The absence of reliable, secure, stable and long term production has limited commercial applications of scandium. Despite this low level of use, scandium offers significant benefits. Particularly promising is the strengthening of aluminium alloys with as little as 0.5% scandium. Scandium-stabilized zirconia enjoys a growing market demand for use as a high efficiency electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also categories: Scandium compounds&nbsp;and Scandium minerals</div>\n<p>The chemistry is almost completely dominated by the trivalent ion, Sc. The radii of M ions in the table below indicate that in terms of chemical properties, scandium ions are more similar to those of yttrium than to those of aluminium. In part for this similarity, scandium is often classified as a lanthanide-like element.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Oxides and hydroxides</h3>\n<p>The oxide ScO and the hydroxide Sc(OH) are amphoteric:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Sc(OH) + 3 OH → Sc(OH)3−\n6</dd>\n<dd>Sc(OH) + 3 H + 3 HO → [Sc(HO)]</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The α- and γ- forms of scandium oxide hydroxide (ScO(OH)), are isostructural with their aluminium oxide hydroxide counterparts. Solutions of Sc in water are acidic because of hydrolysis.</p>\n<h3>Halides and pseudohalides</h3>\n<p>The halides ScX (X = Cl, Br, I) are very soluble in water, but ScF is insoluble. In all four halides the scandium is 6-coordinated. The halides are Lewis acids; for example, ScF dissolves a solution containing excess fluoride to form [ScF]. The coordination number 6 is typical of Sc(III). In the larger Y and La ions, coordination numbers of 8 and 9 are common. Scandium(III) triflate is sometimes used as a Lewis acid catalyst in organic chemistry.</p>\n<h3>Organic derivatives</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organoscandium chemistry</div>\n<p>Scandium forms a series of organometallic compounds with cyclopentadienyl ligands (Cp), similar to the behavior of the lanthanides. One example is the chlorine-bridged dimer, [ScCpCl] and related derivatives of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands.</p>\n<h3>Uncommon oxidation states</h3>\n<p>Compounds that feature scandium in the oxidation state other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound CsScCl is one of the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers. Scandium hydride is not well understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Dmitri Mendeleev, creator of the periodic table, predicted the existence of an element <i>ekaboron</i>, with an atomic mass between 40 and 48 in 1869. Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team detected this element in the minerals euxenite and gadolinite. Nilson prepared 2&nbsp;grams of scandium oxide of high purity. He named the element scandium, from the Latin <i>Scandia</i> meaning \"Scandinavia\". Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev's prediction, but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev.</p>\n<p>Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture, at 700–800&nbsp;°C, of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. The use for aluminium alloys began in 1971, following a US patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.</p>\n<p>Laser crystals of gadolinium-scandium-gallium garnet (GSGG) were used in strategic defense applications developed in the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in the 1980s and the 1990s.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nParts of the MiG-29 are made from Al-Sc alloy.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The addition of scandium to aluminium limits the excessive grain growth that occurs in the heat-affected zone of welded aluminium components. This has two beneficial effects: the precipitated AlSc forms smaller crystals than are formed in other aluminium alloys and the volume of precipitate-free zones that normally exist at the grain boundaries of age-hardening aluminium alloys is reduced. Both of these effects increase the usefulness of the alloy. However, titanium alloys, which are similar in lightness and strength, are cheaper and much more widely used.</p>\n<p>The main application of scandium by weight is in aluminium-scandium alloys for minor aerospace industry components. These alloys contain between 0.1% and 0.5% of scandium. They were used in the Russian military aircraft, specifically the MiG-21 and MiG-29.</p>\n<p>Some items of sports equipment, which rely on high performance materials, have been made with scandium-aluminium alloys, including baseball bats, and bicycle frames and components. Lacrosse sticks are also made with scandium. The American firearm manufacturing company Smith &amp; Wesson produces revolvers with frames composed of scandium alloy and cylinders of titanium or carbon steel.</p>\n<p>Dentists use Erbium, chromium: yttrium-scandium-gallium garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) lasers for cavity preparation and in endodontics.</p>\n<p>Approximately 20&nbsp;kg (as ScO) of scandium is used annually in the United States to make high-intensity discharge lamps. Scandium iodide, along with sodium iodide, when added to a modified form of mercury-vapor lamp, produces a form of metal halide lamp. This lamp is a white light source with high color rendering index that sufficiently resembles sunlight to allow good color-reproduction with TV cameras. About 80&nbsp;kg of scandium is used in metal halide lamps/light bulbs globally per year. The first scandium-based metal halide lamps were patented by General Electric and initially made in North America, although they are now produced in all major industrialized countries. The radioactive isotope Sc is used in oil refineries as a tracing agent. Scandium triflate is a catalytic Lewis acid used in organic chemistry.</p>\n<h2>Health and safety</h2>\n<p>Elemental scandium is considered non-toxic and little animal testing of scandium compounds has been done. The median lethal dose (LD) levels for scandium(III) chloride for rats have been determined as 4&nbsp;mg/kg for intraperitoneal and 755&nbsp;mg/kg for oral administration. In the light of these results compounds of scandium should be handled as compounds of moderate toxicity.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Rare earth element</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   McGuire, Joseph C.; Kempter, Charles P.

  "title": "Transition metal",
  "html": "\n<p>In chemistry, the term <b>transition metal</b> (or <b>transition element</b>) has two possible meanings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The IUPAC definition defines a transition metal as \"an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete <i>d</i> sub-shell\".</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Most scientists describe a \"transition metal\" as any element in the d-block of the periodic table (all are metals), which includes groups 3 to 12 on the periodic table. In actual practice, the f-block lanthanide and actinide series are also considered transition metals and are called \"inner transition metals\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jensen reviews the history of the terms \"transition element\" (or \"metal\") and \"d-block\". The word <i>transition</i> was first used to describe the elements now known as the d-block by the English chemist Charles Bury in 1921, who referred to a transition series of elements during the change of an inner layer of electrons (for example n=3 in the 4th row of the periodic table) from a stable group of 8 to one of 18, or from 18 to 32.</p>\n\n<h2>Classification</h2>\n<p>In the <i>d</i>-block the atoms of the elements have between 1 and 10 <i>d</i> electrons.</p>\n\n<p>With a few minor exceptions, the electronic structure of transition metal atoms can be written as [ ]<i>ns</i>(<i>n-1</i>)<i>d</i>, where the inner <i>d</i> orbital has more energy than the valence-shell <i>s</i> orbital. In divalent and trivalent ions of the transition metals, the situation is reversed such that the <i>s</i> electrons have higher energy. Consequently, an ion such as Fe2+ has no <i>s</i> electrons: it has the electronic configuration [Ar]3d as compared with the configuration of the atom, [Ar]4s3d.</p>\n<p>The elements of groups 3–12 are now generally recognized as transition metals, although the elements La-Lu and Ac-Lr and Group 12 attract different definitions from different authors.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Many chemistry textbooks and printed periodic tables classify La and Ac as Group 3 elements and transition metals, since their atomic ground-state configurations are sd like Sc and Y. The elements Ce-Lu are considered as the “lanthanide” series (or “lanthanoid” according to IUPAC) and Th-Lr as the “actinide” series. The two series together are classified as f-block elements, or (in older sources) as “inner transition elements”.</li>\n<li>Some inorganic chemistry textbooks include La with the lanthanides and Ac with the actinides. This classification is based on similaritites in chemical behaviour, and defines 15 elements in each of the two series even though they correspond to the filling of an f subshell which can only contain 14 electrons.</li>\n<li>A third classification defines the f-block elements as La-Yb and Ac-No, while placing Lu and Lr in Group 3. This is based on the aufbau principle (or Madelung rule) for filling electron subshells, in which 4f is filled before 5d (and 5f before 6d), so that the f subshell is actually full at Yb (and No) while Lu (and Lr) has an [ ]sfd configuration. However La and Ac are exceptions to the Aufbau principle with electron configuration [ ]sd (not [ ]sf as the aufbau principle predicts) so it is not clear from atomic electron configurations whether La or Lu (Ac or Lr) should be considered a transition metal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Zinc, cadmium, and mercury are sometimes incorrectly classified as non-transition metals as they have the electronic configuration [ ]<i>d</i>s, with no incomplete <i>d</i> shell. In the oxidation state +2 the ions have the electronic configuration [ ] d. However, these elements can exist in many other oxidation states, including the +1 oxidation state, as in the diatomic ion Hg2+\n2. The group 12 elements Zn, Cd and Hg may be classed as post-transition metals in this case, because of the formation of a covalent bond between the two atoms of the dimer. However, it is often convenient to include these elements in a discussion of the transition elements. For example, when discussing the crystal field stabilization energy of first-row transition elements, it is convenient to also include the elements calcium and zinc, as both Ca2+ and Zn2+ have a value of zero against which the value for other transition metal ions may be compared. Another example occurs in the Irving-Williams series of stability constants of complexes.</p>\n<p>The recent synthesis of mercury(IV) fluoride (HgF\n4) reinforces that these elements should now always be considered a transition metal.</p>\n<h2>Characteristic properties</h2>\n<p>There are a number of properties shared by the transition elements that are not found in other elements, which results from the partially filled <i>d</i> shell. These include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the formation of compounds whose colour is due to <i>d</i> – <i>d</i> electronic transitions</li>\n<li>the formation of compounds in many oxidation states, due to the relatively low reactivity of unpaired <i>d</i> electrons.</li>\n<li>the formation of many paramagnetic compounds due to the presence of unpaired <i>d</i> electrons. A few compounds of main group elements are also paramagnetic (e.g. nitric oxide, oxygen)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Coloured compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFrom left to right, aqueous solutions of: Co(NO\n3)\n2 (red); K\n2Cr\n2O\n7 (orange); K\n2CrO\n4 (yellow); NiCl\n2 (turquoise); CuSO\n4 (blue); KMnO\n4 (purple).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Colour in transition-series metal compounds is generally due to electronic transitions of two principal types.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>charge transfer transitions. An electron may jump from a predominantly ligand orbital to a predominantly metal orbital, giving rise to a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transition. These can most easily occur when the metal is in a high oxidation state. For example, the colour of chromate, dichromate and permanganate ions is due to LMCT transitions. Another example is that mercuric iodide, HgI, is red because of a LMCT transition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A metal-to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition will be most likely when the metal is in a low oxidation state and the ligand is easily reduced.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>d</i>-<i>d</i> transitions. An electron jumps from one d-orbital to another. In complexes of the transition metals the <i>d</i> orbitals do not all have the same energy. The pattern of splitting of the <i>d</i> orbitals can be calculated using crystal field theory. The extent of the splitting depends on the particular metal, its oxidation state and the nature of the ligands. The actual energy levels are shown on Tanabe-Sugano diagrams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In centrosymmetric complexes, such as octahedral complexes, <i>d</i>-<i>d</i> transitions are forbidden by the Laporte rule and only occur because of vibronic coupling in which a molecular vibration occurs together with a <i>d-d</i> transition. Tetrahedral complexes have somewhat more intense colour because mixing <i>d</i> and <i>p</i> orbitals is possible when there is no centre of symmetry, so transitions are not pure <i>d-d</i> transitions. The molar absorptivity (ε) of bands caused by <i>d-d</i> transitions are relatively low, roughly in the range 5-500 Mcm (where M = mol dm). Some <i>d</i>-<i>d</i> transitions are spin forbidden. An example occurs in octahedral, high-spin complexes of manganese(II), which has a <i>d</i> configuration in which all five electron has parallel spins; the colour of such complexes is much weaker than in complexes with spin-allowed transitions. In fact many compounds of manganese(II) appear almost colourless. The spectrum of [Mn(H\n2O)\n6]2+ shows a maximum molar absorptivity of about 0.04 Mcm in the visible spectrum.</p>\n<h3>Oxidation states</h3>\n<p>A characteristic of transition metals is that they exhibit two or more oxidation states, usually differing by one. For example, compounds of vanadium are known in all oxidation states between −1, such as [V(CO)\n6]−, and +5, such as VO3−\n4.</p>\n<p>Main group elements in groups 13 to 17 also exhibit multiple oxidation states. The \"common\" oxidation states of these elements typically differ by two. For example, compounds of gallium in oxidation states +1 and +3 exist in which there is a single gallium atom. No compound of Ga(II) is known: any such compound would have an unpaired electron and would behave as a free radical and be destroyed rapidly. The only compounds in which gallium has a formal oxidation state of +2 are dimeric compounds, such as [Ga\n2Cl\n6]2−, which contain a Ga-Ga bond formed from the unpaired electron on each Ga atom. Thus the main difference in oxidation states, between transition elements and other elements is that oxidation states are known in which there is a single atom of the element and one or more unpaired electrons.</p>\n<p>The maximum oxidation state in the first row transition metals is equal to the number of valence electrons from titanium (+4) up to manganese (+7), but decreases in the later elements. In the second and third rows the maximum occurs with ruthenium and osmium (+8). In compounds such as [MnO\n4]− and OsO\n4 the elements achieve a stable octet by forming four covalent bonds.</p>\n<p>The lowest oxidation states are exhibited in such compounds as Cr(CO)\n6 (oxidation state zero) and [Fe(CO)\n4]2− (oxidation state −2) in which the 18-electron rule is obeyed. These complexes are also covalent.</p>\n<p>Ionic compounds are mostly formed with oxidation states +2 and +3. In aqueous solution the ions are hydrated by (usually) six water molecules arranged octahedrally.</p>\n<h3>Magnetism</h3>\n<div>Main article: magnetochemistry</div>\n<p>Transition metal compounds are paramagnetic when they have one or more unpaired <i>d</i> electrons. In octahedral complexes with between four and seven <i>d</i> electrons both high spin and low spin states are possible. Tetrahedral transition metal complexes such as [FeCl\n4]2− are high spin because the crystal field splitting is small so that the energy to be gained by virtue of the electrons being in lower energy orbitals is always less than the energy needed to pair up the spins. Some compounds are diamagnetic. These include octahedral, low-spin, <i>d</i> and square-planar <i>d complexes</i>. In these cases, crystal field splitting is such that all the electrons are paired up.</p>\n<p>Ferromagnetism occurs when individual atoms are paramagnetic and the spin vectors are aligned parallel to each other in a crystalline material. Metallic iron and the alloy alnico are examples of ferromagnetic materials involving transition metals. Anti-ferromagnetism is another example of a magnetic property arising from a particular alignment of individual spins in the solid state.</p>\n<h3>Catalytic properties</h3>\n<p>The transition metals and their compounds are known for their homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in the contact process), finely divided iron (in the Haber process), and nickel (in catalytic hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface (nanomaterial-based catalysts) involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilize 3d and 4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowered). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts.</p>\n<h3>Other properties</h3>\n<p>As implied by the name, all transition metals are metals and conductors of electricity.</p>\n<p>In general, transition metals possess a high density and high melting points and boiling points. These properties are due to metallic bonding by delocalized d electrons, leading to cohesion which increases with the number of shared electrons. However the group 12 metals have much lower melting and boiling points since their full d subshells prevent d–d bonding. In fact mercury has a melting point of −38.83 °C (−37.89 °F)&nbsp; and is a liquid at room temperature.</p>\n<p>Many transition metals can be bound to a variety of ligands.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Inner transition element, a name given to any member of the f-block</li>\n<li>Main group element, an element other than a transition metal.</li>\n<li>Ligand field theory a development of crystal field theory taking covalency into account.</li>\n<li>Crystal field theory a model that describes the breaking of degeneracies of electronic orbital states.</li>\n<li>Post-transition metal, a metallic element to the right of the transition metals in the periodic table.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ IUPAC, Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed.

  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Titanium (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Titanium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Ti</b> and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density and high strength. It is highly resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia and chlorine.</p>\n<p>Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, and it is found in almost all living things, rocks, water bodies, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores via the Kroll process or the Hunter process. Its most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.</p>\n<p>Titanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, molybdenum, among other elements, to produce strong lightweight alloys for aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial process (chemicals and petro-chemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agri-food, medical prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental and endodontic instruments and files, dental implants, sporting goods, jewelry, mobile phones, and other applications.</p>\n<p>The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metal. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but 45% lighter. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, Ti through Ti, with Ti being the most abundant (73.8%). Titanium's properties are chemically and physically similar to zirconium, as both of them have the same number of valence electrons and are in the same group in the periodic table.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>A metallic element, titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650&nbsp;°C or 3,000&nbsp;°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.</p>\n<p>Commercial (99.2% pure) grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 63,000 psi (434 MPa), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are 45% lighter. Titanium is 60% more dense than aluminium, but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. Certain titanium alloys (e.g., Beta C) achieve tensile strengths of over 200,000 psi (1,400&nbsp;MPa). However, titanium loses strength when heated above 430 °C (806&nbsp;°F).</p>\n<p>Titanium is fairly hard (although not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel), non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, as the material will soften and gall if sharp tools and proper cooling methods are not used. Like those made from steel, titanium structures have a fatigue limit which guarantees longevity in some applications. Titanium alloys have lower specific stiffnesses than in many other structural materials such as aluminium alloys and carbon fiber.</p>\n<p>The metal is a dimorphic allotrope whose hexagonal alpha form changes into a body-centered cubic (lattice) β form at 882 °C (1,620&nbsp;°F). The specific heat of the alpha form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the β form regardless of temperature. Similar to zirconium and hafnium, an additional omega phase exists, which is thermodynamically stable at high pressures, but is metastable at ambient pressures. This phase is usually hexagonal (<i>ideal</i>) or trigonal (<i>distorted</i>) and can be viewed as being due to a soft longitudinal acoustic phonon of the β phase causing collapse of (111) planes of atoms.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Pourbaix diagram for titanium in pure water, perchloric acid or sodium hydroxide</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Like aluminium and magnesium metal surfaces, titanium metal and alloy surfaces oxidize immediately when they are exposed to air. Titanium readily reacts with oxygen at 1,200 °C (2,190&nbsp;°F) in air, and at 610 °C (1,130&nbsp;°F) in pure oxygen, forming titanium dioxide. However, it is slow to react with water and air, as it forms a passive and protective oxide coating that protects it from further reaction. When it first forms, this protective layer is only 1–2 nm thick but continues to slowly grow; reaching a thickness of 25&nbsp;nm in four years.</p>\n<p>When exposed to nitrogen clean titanium metal is covered with a titanium nitride layer. The thin titanium dioxide and nitride layers on titanium surfaces are very hard and inert.</p>\n<p>The most noted chemical property of titanium is its excellent resistance to corrosion; it is almost as resistant as platinum, capable of withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid as well as chlorine gas, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, it is soluble in concentrated acids. The Pourbaix diagram in the image shows that titanium is actually thermodynamically a very reactive metal.</p>\n<p>The metal cannot be melted in open air since it burns before the melting point is reached. Melting is only possible in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At 550 °C (1,022&nbsp;°F), it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.</p>\n<p>Titanium is one of the few elements that burns in pure nitrogen gas, reacting at 800 °C (1,470&nbsp;°F) to form titanium nitride, which causes embrittlement. Titanium powder can form an explosive suspension in air.</p>\n<p>Because clean titanium metal is highly reactive and titanium binds strongly to oxygen, nitrogen and many other gases, titanium filaments are applied in titanium sublimation pumps. Titanium sublimation pumps are inexpensive and reliable devices which are applied as the last step to create extremely low pressures in ultra-high vacuum systems.</p>\n<p>Experiments have shown that natural titanium becomes radioactive after it is bombarded with deuterons, emitting mainly positrons and hard gamma rays.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>See also categories: Titanium compounds&nbsp;and Titanium minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTiN coated drill bit</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The +4 oxidation state dominates titanium chemistry, but compounds in the +3 oxidation state are also common. Because of this high oxidation state, many titanium compounds have a high degree of covalent bonding.</p>\n<p>Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism from the titanium dioxide impurities present in them. Titanates are compounds made with titanium dioxide. Barium titanate has piezoelectric properties, thus making it possible to use it as a transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity. Esters of titanium are formed by the reaction of alcohols and titanium tetrachloride and are used to waterproof fabrics.</p>\n<p>Titanium nitride (TiN), having a hardness equivalent to sapphire and carborundum (9.0 on the Mohs Scale), is often used to coat cutting tools, such as drill bits. It also finds use as a gold-colored decorative finish, and as a barrier metal in semiconductor fabrication.</p>\n<p>Titanium tetrachloride (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl) is a colorless liquid which is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of titanium dioxide for paint. It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama aldol condensation. Titanium also forms a lower chloride, titanium(III) chloride (TiCl), which is used as a reducing agent.</p>\n<p>Titanocene dichloride is an important catalyst for carbon-carbon bond formation. Titanium isopropoxide is used for Sharpless epoxidation. Other compounds include titanium bromide (used in metallurgy, superalloys, and high-temperature electrical wiring and coatings) and titanium carbide (found in high-temperature cutting tools and coatings).</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n\n<p>Titanium is always bonded to other elements in nature. It is the ninth-most abundant element in the Earth's crust (0.63% by mass) and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present in most igneous rocks and in sediments derived from them (as well as in living things and natural bodies of water). Of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the United States Geological Survey, 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.</p>\n<p>It is widely distributed and occurs primarily in the minerals anatase, brookite, ilmenite, perovskite, rutile and titanite (sphene). Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of these minerals have been mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia, Canada, China, India, Mozambique, New Zealand, Norway, Ukraine and South Africa. About 186,000 tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.</p>\n<p>Titanium is contained in meteorites and has been detected in the sun and in M-type stars; the coolest type of star with a surface temperature of 3,200 °C (5,790&nbsp;°F). Rocks brought back from the moon during the Apollo 17 mission are composed of 12.1% TiO. It is also found in coal ash, plants, and even the human body.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of titanium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring titanium is composed of 5 stable isotopes: Ti, Ti, Ti, Ti, and Ti, with Ti being the most abundant (73.8% natural abundance). Eleven radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being Ti with a half-life of 63 years, Ti with a half-life of 184.8 minutes, Ti with a half-life of 5.76 minutes, and Ti with a half-life of 1.7 minutes. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 33 seconds and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half a second.</p>\n<p>The isotopes of titanium range in atomic weight from 39.99 u (Ti) to 57.966 u (Ti). The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, Ti, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay products before Ti are element 21 (scandium) isotopes and the primary products after are element 23 (vanadium) isotopes.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMartin Heinrich Klaproth named titanium for the Titans of Greek mythology.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Titanium was discovered included in a mineral in Cornwall, Great Britain, in 1791 by the clergyman and amateur geologist William Gregor, then vicar of Creed parish. He recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite when he found black sand by a stream in the nearby parish of Manaccan and noticed the sand was attracted by a magnet. Analysis of the sand determined the presence of two metal oxides; iron oxide (explaining the attraction to the magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify. Gregor, realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match the properties of any known element, reported his findings to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and in the German science journal <i>Crell's Annalen</i>.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein produced a similar substance, but could not identify it. The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by Prussian chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in rutile from Boinik (German name of unknown place) village of Hungary (Now in Slovakia). Klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of <i>manaccanite</i> and confirmed it contained titanium.</p>\n<p>The processes required to extract titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly; it is not possible to reduce the ore in the normal manner, by heating in the presence of carbon, as that produces titanium carbide. Pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by heating TiCl with sodium at 700–800&nbsp;°C in the Hunter process. Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when William Justin Kroll proved that it could be produced by reducing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl) with calcium. Eight years later he refined this process by using magnesium and even sodium in what became known as the Kroll process. Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes (e.g., FFC Cambridge), the Kroll process is still used for commercial production.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTitanium sponge, made by the Kroll process</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Titanium of very high purity was made in small quantities when Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer discovered the iodide, or crystal bar, process in 1925, by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapors over a hot filament to pure metal.</p>\n<p>In the 1950s and 1960s the Soviet Union pioneered the use of titanium in military and submarine applications (Alfa Class and Mike Class) as part of programs related to the Cold War. Starting in the early 1950s, titanium began to be used extensively for military aviation purposes, particularly in high-performance jets, starting with aircraft such as the F100 Super Sabre and Lockheed A-12.</p>\n<p>In the USA, the Department of Defense realized the strategic importance of the metal and supported early efforts of commercialization. Throughout the period of the Cold War, titanium was considered a strategic material by the U.S. government, and a large stockpile of titanium sponge was maintained by the Defense National Stockpile Center, which was finally depleted in the 2000s. According to 2006 data, the world's largest producer, Russian-based VSMPO-Avisma, was estimated to account for about 29% of the world market share. As of 2009, titanium sponge metal was produced in six countries: China, Japan, Russia, Kazakhstan, USA and Ukraine (in order of output).</p>\n<p>In 2006, the U.S. Defense Agency awarded $5.7 million to a two-company consortium to develop a new process for making titanium metal powder. Under heat and pressure, the powder can be used to create strong, lightweight items ranging from armor plating to components for the aerospace, transport, and chemical processing industries.</p>\n<h2>Production and fabrication</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTitanium (mineral concentrate)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The processing of titanium metal occurs in 4 major steps: reduction of titanium ore into \"sponge\", a porous form; melting of sponge, or sponge plus a master alloy to form an ingot; primary fabrication, where an ingot is converted into general mill products such as billet, bar, plate, sheet, strip, and tube; and secondary fabrication of finished shapes from mill products.</p>\n<p>Because the metal reacts with oxygen at high temperatures it cannot be produced by reduction of its dioxide. Titanium metal is therefore produced commercially by the Kroll process, a complex and expensive batch process. (The relatively high market value of titanium is mainly due to its processing, which sacrifices another expensive metal, magnesium.) In the Kroll process, the oxide is first converted to chloride through carbochlorination, whereby chlorine gas is passed over red-hot rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon to make TiCl. This is condensed and purified by fractional distillation and then reduced with 800&nbsp;°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere.</p>\n<p>A more recently developed method, the FFC Cambridge process, may eventually replace the Kroll process. This method uses titanium dioxide powder (which is a refined form of rutile) as feedstock to make the end product which is either a powder or sponge. If mixed oxide powders are used, the product is an alloy manufactured at a much lower cost than the conventional multi-step melting process. The FFC Cambridge process may render titanium a less rare and expensive material for the aerospace industry and the luxury goods market, and could be seen in many products currently manufactured using aluminium and specialist grades of steel.</p>\n<p>Common titanium alloys are made by reduction. For example, cuprotitanium (rutile with copper added is reduced), ferrocarbon titanium (ilmenite reduced with coke in an electric furnace), and manganotitanium (rutile with manganese or manganese oxides) are reduced.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 FeTiO + 7 Cl + 6 C → 2 TiCl + 2 FeCl + 6 CO (900&nbsp;°C)</dd>\n<dd>TiCl + 2 Mg → 2 MgCl + Ti (1100&nbsp;°C)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>About 50 grades of titanium and titanium alloys are designated and currently used, although only a couple of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 Grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). These four are distinguished by their varying degrees of tensile strength, as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific purposes, be it ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, resistance to corrosion from specific media, or a combination thereof.</p>\n<p>The grades covered by ASTM and other alloys are also produced to meet Aerospace and Military specifications (SAE-AMS, MIL-T), ISO standards, and country-specific specifications, as well as proprietary end-user specifications for aerospace, military, medical, and industrial applications.</p>\n<p>In terms of fabrication, all welding of titanium must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, or hydrogen. Contamination will cause a variety of conditions, such as embrittlement, which will reduce the integrity of the assembly welds and lead to joint failure. Commercially pure flat product (sheet, plate) can be formed readily, but processing must take into account the fact that the metal has a \"memory\" and tends to spring back. This is especially true of certain high-strength alloys. Titanium cannot be soldered without first pre-plating it in a metal that is solderable. The metal can be machined using the same equipment and via the same processes as stainless steel.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA titanium cylinder, \"Grade 2\" quality</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Titanium is used in steel as an alloying element (ferro-titanium) to reduce grain size and as a deoxidizer, and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content. Titanium is often alloyed with aluminium (to refine grain size), vanadium, copper (to harden), iron, manganese, molybdenum, and with other metals. Applications for titanium mill products (sheet, plate, bar, wire, forgings, castings) can be found in industrial, aerospace, recreational, and emerging markets. Powdered titanium is used in pyrotechnics as a source of bright-burning particles.</p>\n<h3>Pigments, additives and coatings</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTitanium dioxide is the most commonly used compound of titanium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>About 95% of titanium ore extracted from the Earth is destined for refinement into titanium dioxide (TiO\n2), an intensely white permanent pigment used in paints, paper, toothpaste, and plastics. It is also used in cement, in gemstones, as an optical opacifier in paper, and a strengthening agent in graphite composite fishing rods and golf clubs.</p>\n<p>TiO\n2 powder is chemically inert, resists fading in sunlight, and is very opaque: this allows it to impart a pure and brilliant white color to the brown or gray chemicals that form the majority of household plastics. In nature, this compound is found in the minerals anatase, brookite, and rutile. Paint made with titanium dioxide does well in severe temperatures, and stands up to marine environments. Pure titanium dioxide has a very high index of refraction and an optical dispersion higher than diamond. In addition to being a very important pigment, titanium dioxide is also used in sunscreens due to its ability to protect skin by itself. Recently, titanium oxide has been put to use in air purifiers (as a filter coating), or in film used to coat windows on buildings so that when titanium oxide becomes exposed to UV light (either solar or artificial) and moisture in the air, reactive redox species like hydroxyl radicals are produced so that they can purify the air or keep window surfaces clean.</p>\n<h3>Aerospace and marine</h3>\n<p>Due to their high tensile strength to density ratio, high corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, high crack resistance, and ability to withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping, titanium alloys are used in aircraft, armor plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles. For these applications titanium alloyed with aluminium, zirconium, nickel, vanadium, and other elements is used for a variety of components including critical structural parts, fire walls, landing gear, exhaust ducts (helicopters), and hydraulic systems. In fact, about two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft engines and frames. The SR-71 \"Blackbird\" was one of the first aircraft to make extensive use of titanium within its structure, paving the way for its use in modern military and commercial aircraft. An estimated 59 metric tons (130,000 pounds) are used in the Boeing 777, 45 in the Boeing 747, 18 in the Boeing 737, 32 in the Airbus A340, 18 in the Airbus A330, and 12 in the Airbus A320. The Airbus A380 may use 77 metric tons, including about 11 tons in the engines. In engine applications, titanium is used for rotors, compressor blades, hydraulic system components, and nacelles. The titanium 6AL-4V alloy accounts for almost 50% of all alloys used in aircraft applications.</p>\n<p>Due to its high corrosion resistance to sea water, titanium is used to make propeller shafts and rigging and in the heat exchangers of desalination plants; in heater-chillers for salt water aquariums, fishing line and leader, and for divers' knives. Titanium is used to manufacture the housings and other components of ocean-deployed surveillance and monitoring devices for scientific and military use. The former Soviet Union developed techniques for making submarines with hulls of titanium alloys. Techniques were developed in the Soviet Union to forge titanium in huge vacuum tubes.</p>\n<h3>Industrial</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHigh-purity (99.999%) titanium with visible crystallites</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Welded titanium pipe and process equipment (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) are used in the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance. Specific alloys are used in downhole and nickel hydrometallurgy applications due to their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or combination of both. The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas (in the bleachery). Other applications include: ultrasonic welding, wave soldering, and sputtering targets.</p>\n<p>Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl), a colorless liquid, is important as an intermediate in the process of making TiO and is also used to produce the Ziegler-Natta catalyst, and is used to iridize glass and because it fumes strongly in moist air it is also used to make smoke screens.</p>\n<h3>Consumer and architectural</h3>\n<p>Titanium metal is used in automotive applications, particularly in automobile or motorcycle racing, where weight reduction is critical while maintaining high strength and rigidity. The metal is generally too expensive to make it marketable to the general consumer market, other than high-end products, particularly for the racing/performance market. Late model Corvettes have been available with titanium exhausts.</p>\n<p>Titanium is used in many sporting goods: tennis rackets, golf clubs, lacrosse stick shafts; cricket, hockey, lacrosse, and football helmet grills; and bicycle frames and components. Although not a mainstream material for bicycle production, titanium bikes have been used by race teams and adventure cyclists. Titanium alloys are also used in spectacle frames. This results in a rather expensive, but highly durable and long lasting frame which is light in weight and causes no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, these titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium is also favored for use by farriers, since it is lighter and more durable than steel when formed into horseshoes.</p>\n<p>Titanium has occasionally been used in architectural applications: the 40 m (131&nbsp;foot) memorial to Yuri Gagarin, the first man to travel in space, in Moscow, is made of titanium for the metal's attractive color and association with rocketry. The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Cerritos Millennium Library were the first buildings in Europe and North America, respectively, to be sheathed in titanium panels. Other construction uses of titanium sheathing include the Frederic C. Hamilton Building in Denver, Colorado and the 107 m (350&nbsp;foot) Monument to the Conquerors of Space in Moscow.</p>\n<p>Because of its superior strength and light weight when compared to other metals traditionally used in firearms (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and advances in metalworking techniques, the use of titanium has become more widespread in the manufacture of firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For these same reasons, it is also used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in Apple's PowerBook line).</p>\n<p>Some upmarket categories of tools made to be lightweight and corrosion-resistant, such as shovels and flashlights, are made of titanium or titanium alloys as well.</p>\n<h3>Jewelry</h3>\n<p>Because of its durability, titanium has become more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its inertness makes it a good choice for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold, as the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and thus is more durable than a pure 24-carat gold item would be.</p>\n<p>Titanium's durability, light weight, dent- and corrosion resistance makes it useful in the production of watch cases. Some artists work with titanium to produce artworks such as sculptures, decorative objects and furniture.</p>\n<p>The inertness and ability to be attractively colored makes titanium a popular metal for use in body piercing. Titanium may be anodized to produce various colors, which varies the thickness of the surface oxide layer and causes interference fringes.</p>\n<h3>Medical</h3>\n<p>Because it is biocompatible (it is non-toxic and is not rejected by the body), titanium is used in a gamut of medical applications including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and sockets (joint replacement) that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.</p>\n<p>Titanium has the inherent ability to osseointegrate, enabling use in dental implants that can remain in place for over 30 years. This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications. These benefit from titanium's lower modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still more than twice that of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.</p>\n<p>Since titanium is non-ferromagnetic, patients with titanium implants can be safely examined with magnetic resonance imaging (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized.</p>\n<p>Titanium is also used for the surgical instruments used in image-guided surgery, as well as wheelchairs, crutches, and any other products where high strength and low weight are desirable.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear waste storage</h3>\n<p>Due to its extreme corrosion resistance, titanium containers have been studied for the long-term storage of nuclear waste (containers lasting over 100,000 years are possible under proper manufacturing conditions to reduce defects in the process). A titanium \"drip shield\" could also be placed over other types of containers to further contain the waste.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>A titanium body piercing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Characteristic weld beads on a handmade titanium bicycle frame.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is sheathed in titanium panels.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>A titanium ring.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>A titanium spork useful for backpackers.

An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed. It does, however, have a tendency to bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.</p>\n<p>As a powder or in the form of metal shavings, titanium metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in air, an explosion hazard. Water and carbon dioxide–based methods to extinguish fires are ineffective on burning titanium; Class D dry powder fire fighting agents must be used instead.</p>\n<p>When used in the production or handling of chlorine, care must be taken to use titanium only in locations where it will not be exposed to dry chlorine gas which can result in a titanium/chlorine fire. A fire hazard exists even when titanium is used in wet chlorine due to possible unexpected drying brought about by extreme weather conditions.</p>\n<p>Titanium can catch fire when a fresh, non-oxidized surface comes in contact with liquid oxygen. Such surfaces can appear when the oxidized surface is struck with a hard object, or when a mechanical strain causes the emergence of a crack. This poses the possible limitation for its use in liquid oxygen systems, such as those found in the aerospace industry.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Titanium in Africa</li>\n<li>Titanium alloy</li>\n<li>Titanium coating</li>\n<li>Titanium Man</li>\n<li>Titanium Metals Corporation</li>\n<li>Titanium rings</li>\n<li>Titanium sublimation pump</li>\n<li>VSMPO-AVISMA</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Andersson, N. et al.

  "title": "Vanadium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Vanadium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>V</b> and atomic number 23. It is a hard, silvery gray, ductile and malleable transition metal. The element is found only in chemically combined form in nature, but once isolated artificially, the formation of an oxide layer stabilizes the free metal somewhat against further oxidation.</p>\n<p>Andrés Manuel del Río discovered compounds of vanadium in 1801 by analyzing a new lead-bearing mineral he called \"brown lead,\" and presumed its qualities were due to the presence of a new element, which he named <i>erythronium</i> (Greek for \"red\") since, upon heating, most of its salts turned from their initial color to red. Four years later, however, he was (erroneously) convinced by other scientists that erythronium was identical to chromium. Chlorides of vanadium were generated in 1830 by Nils Gabriel Sefström who thereby proved that a new element was involved, which he named \"vanadium\" after the Germanic goddess of beauty and fertility, Vanadís (Freyja). Both names were attributed to the wide range of colors found in vanadium compounds. Del Rio's lead mineral was later renamed vanadinite for its vanadium content. In 1867 Henry Enfield Roscoe obtained the pure element.</p>\n<p>Vanadium occurs naturally in about 65 different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits. It is produced in China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high speed tool steels. The most important industrial vanadium compound, vanadium pentoxide, is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid.</p>\n<p>Large amounts of vanadium ions are found in a few organisms, possibly as a toxin. The oxide and some other salts of vanadium have moderate toxicity. Particularly in the ocean, vanadium is used by some life forms as an active center of enzymes, such as the vanadium bromoperoxidase of some ocean algae. Vanadium is probably a micronutrient in mammals, including humans, but its precise role in this regard is unknown.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Vanadium was originally discovered by Andrés Manuel del Río, a Spanish-born Mexican mineralogist, in 1801. Del Río extracted the element from a sample of Mexican \"brown lead\" ore, later named vanadinite. He found that its salts exhibit a wide variety of colors, and as a result he named the element <i>panchromium</i> (Greek: παγχρώμιο \"all colors\"). Later, Del Río renamed the element <i>erythronium</i> (Greek: ερυθρός \"red\") as most of its salts turned red upon heating. In 1805, the French chemist Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils, backed by del Río's friend Baron Alexander von Humboldt, incorrectly declared that del Río's new element was only an impure sample of chromium. Del Río accepted Collet-Descotils' statement and retracted his claim.</p>\n<p>In 1831, the Swedish chemist Nils Gabriel Sefström rediscovered the element in a new oxide he found while working with iron ores. Later that same year, Friedrich Wöhler confirmed del Río's earlier work. Sefström chose a name beginning with V, which had not been assigned to any element yet. He called the element <i>vanadium</i> after Old Norse <i>Vanadís</i> (another name for the Norse Vanr goddess Freyja, whose facets include connections to beauty and fertility), because of the many beautifully colored chemical compounds it produces. In 1831, the geologist George William Featherstonhaugh suggested that vanadium should be renamed \"<i>rionium</i>\" after del Río, but this suggestion was not followed.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Model T made use of vanadium steel in its chassis.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The isolation of vanadium metal proved difficult. In 1831, Berzelius reported the production of the metal, but Henry Enfield Roscoe showed that Berzelius had in fact produced the nitride, vanadium nitride (VN). Roscoe eventually produced the metal in 1867 by reduction of vanadium(II) chloride, VCl, with hydrogen. In 1927, pure vanadium was produced by reducing vanadium pentoxide with calcium. The first large-scale industrial use of vanadium in steels was found in the chassis of the Ford Model T, inspired by French race cars. Vanadium steel allowed for reduced weight while simultaneously increasing tensile strength.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHighpure (99.95%) vanadium cuboids, ebeam remelted and macro etched</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Vanadium is a hard, ductile, silver-gray metal. Some sources describe vanadium as \"soft\", perhaps because it is ductile, malleable and not brittle. Vanadium is harder than most metals and steels (see Hardnesses of the elements (data page) and iron). It has good resistance to corrosion and it is stable against alkalis, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. It is oxidized in air at about 933&nbsp;K (660&nbsp;°C, 1220&nbsp;°F), although an oxide layer forms even at room temperature.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of vanadium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable isotope V and one radioactive isotope V. The latter has a half-life of 1.5×10 years and a natural abundance 0.25%. V has a nuclear spin of 7/2 which is useful for NMR spectroscopy. 24 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, ranging in mass number from 40 to 65. The most stable of these isotopes are V with a half-life of 330 days, and V with a half-life of 16.0 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than an hour, most of which are below 10 seconds. At least 4 isotopes have metastable excited states. Electron capture is the main decay mode for isotopes lighter than the V. For the heavier ones, the most common mode is beta decay. The electron capture reactions lead to the formation of element 22 (titanium) isotopes, while for beta decay, it leads to element 24 (chromium) isotopes.</p>\n<h3>Chemistry and compounds</h3>\n<div>See also category: Vanadium compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOxidation states of vanadium, from left +2 (lilac), +3 (green), +4 (blue) and +5 (yellow).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The chemistry of vanadium is noteworthy for the accessibility of the four adjacent oxidation states 2-5. In aqueous solution the colours are lilac V(aq), green V(aq), blue VO(aq) and, at high pH, yellow VO. Vanadium(II) compounds are reducing agents, and vanadium(V) compounds are oxidizing agents. Vanadium(IV) compounds often exist as vanadyl derivatives which contain the VO center.</p>\n<p>Ammonium vanadate(V) (NHVO) can be successively reduced with elemental zinc to obtain the different colors of vanadium in these four oxidation states. Lower oxidation states occur in compounds such as V(CO), [V(CO)\n6]− and substituted derivatives.</p>\n<p>The vanadium redox battery utilizes all four oxidation states; one electrode uses the +5/+4 couple and the other uses the +3/+2 couple. Conversion of these oxidation states is illustrated by the reduction of a strongly acidic solution of a vanadium(V) compound with zinc dust or amalgam. The initial yellow color characteristic of the pervanadyl ion [VO(HO)] is replaced by the blue color of [VO(HO)], followed by the green color of [V(HO)] and then the violet color due to [V(HO)].</p>\n<p>The most commercially important compound is vanadium pentoxide, which is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid. This compound oxidizes sulfur dioxide (SO\n2) to the trioxide (SO\n3). In this redox reaction, sulfur is oxidized from +4 to +6, and vanadium is reduced from +5 to +3:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>VO + 2 SO → VO + 2 SO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The catalyst is regenerated by oxidation with air:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>VO + O → VO</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4>Oxy-anions and cations</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nthe decavanadate structure</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The oxyanion chemistry of vanadium(V) is complex: the predominance diagram for vanadates in aqueous solution shows at least 11 species to be predominant under specified conditions of pH and concentration. The tetrahedral vanadate ion, VO3−\n4, is the principal species present at pH 12-14. On acidification, the monomer [HVO] and dimer [VO] are formed, with the monomer predominant at vanadium concentration of less than ca. 10M (pV &gt; 2; pV is equal to minus the logarithm of the total vanadium concentration/M). The formation of the divanadate ion is analogous to the formation of the dichromate ion. As the pH is reduced, further protonation and polymerization to polyvanadates occur: at pH 4-6 [HVO] is predominant at pV greater than ca. 4, while at higher concentrations trimers and tetramers are formed. Between pH 2-4 decavanadates predominate. In decavanadates there is a distorted octahedron of oxygen atoms around each vanadium atom. Vanadic acid, HVO has a very low concentration because protonation of the tetrahedral species [HVO] results in the preferential formation of the octahedral [VO(HO)] species. In strongly acidic solutions, pH&lt;2. [VO(HO)] is the predominant species, while the oxide VO precipitates from solution at high concentrations. The oxide is formally the inorganic anhydride of vanadic acid. The structures of many of these and other vanadate ions have been determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline compounds.</p>\n<p>The acid dissociation constants for the vanadium and phosphorus series are remarkably similar. Chains, rings and clusters involving tetrahedral vanadium, analogous to the polyphosphates, are known. The correspondence between vanadate and phosphate chemistry can be attributed to the similarity in size and charge of phosphorus(V) and vanadium(V). Orthovanadate VO3−\n4 is used in protein crystallography to study the biochemistry of phosphate.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Pourbaix diagram for vanadium in water</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The Pourbaix diagram for vanadium in water, which shows the redox potentials between various vanadium species in different oxidation states is also complex.</p>\n<p>Vanadium(V) also forms various peroxo-complexes. The species VO(O)(HO) is present in acidic solutions. In alkaline solutions species with 2, 3 and 4 peroxide groups are present; the last forms violet crystals MV(O) nHO (M=Li, Na, K, NH), in which the vanadium has an 8-coordinate dodecahedral structure.</p>\n<h4>Chalcogenide and halide compounds</h4>\n<p>Vanadium forms a very large variety of binary compounds with sulfur, selenium and tellurium, often with complicated structures. The tetrahedral sulfa-anion [VS], analogous to the orthovanadate ion, is well-known, but there are no thio-analogues of the polymeric oxo-vanadates.</p>\n<p>All four halides are known for oxidation states +2 and +3, but the iodide is not known for V(IV) and VF is the only halide known for oxidation state 5. VCl may be used as a catalyst for polymerization of dienes.</p>\n<p>Examples of oxyhalides include.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>vanadium(V): VOF, VOX and VOX (X=F, Cl)</li>\n<li>vanadium(IV): VOX (X=F, Cl, Br)</li>\n<li>vanadium(III): VOX, (X=Cl,Br)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Coordination compounds</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA ball-and-stick model of VO(CH)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Vanadium's early position in the transition metal series lead to three rather unusual features of the coordination chemistry of vanadium. Firstly, metallic vanadium has the electronic configuration [Ar]3d4s, so compounds of vanadium are relatively electron-poor. Consequently, most binary compounds are Lewis acids (electron pair acceptors); examples are all the halides forming octahedral adducts with the formula VXL (X = halide; L = other ligand). Secondly, the vanadium ion is rather large and can achieve coordination numbers higher than 6, as is the case in [V(CN)]. Thirdly, the vanadyl ion, VO, is featured in many complexes of vanadium(IV) such as vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(=O)(CH)). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl(NMe).</p>\n<h4>Organometallic compounds</h4>\n<div>Main article: Organovanadium chemistry</div>\n<p>Organometallic chemistry of vanadium is well developed, but organometallic compounds are of minor commercial significance. Vanadocene dichloride is a versatile starting reagent and even finds minor applications in organic chemistry. Vanadium carbonyl, V(CO), is a rare example of a metal carbonyl containing an unpaired electron, but which exists without dimerization. The addition of an electron yields V(CO)−\n6 (isoelectronic with Cr(CO)), which may be further reduced with sodium in liquid ammonia to yield V(CO)3−\n6 (isoelectronic with Fe(CO)).</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>See also category: Vanadate minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nVanadinite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Metallic vanadium is not found in nature, but is known to exist in about 65 different minerals. Economically significant examples include patronite (VS), vanadinite (Pb(VO)Cl), and carnotite (K(UO)(VO)·3HO). Much of the world's vanadium production is sourced from vanadium-bearing magnetite found in ultramafic gabbro bodies. Vanadium is mined mostly in South Africa, north-western China, and eastern Russia. In 2010 these three countries mined more than 98% of the 56,000 tonnes of produced vanadium.</p>\n<p>Vanadium is also present in bauxite and in fossil fuel deposits such as crude oil, coal, oil shale and tar sands. In crude oil, concentrations up to 1200&nbsp;ppm have been reported. When such oil products are burned, the traces of vanadium may initiate corrosion in motors and boilers. An estimated 110,000 tonnes of vanadium per year are released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. Vanadium has also been detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and some other stars.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFerrovanadium chunks</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nElectrolytically refined vanadium dendritic crystals (99,9%)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nIodide refined vanadium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Most vanadium is used as an alloy called ferrovanadium as an additive to improve steels. Ferrovanadium is produced directly by reducing a mixture of vanadium oxide, iron oxides and iron in an electric furnace. Vanadium-bearing magnetite iron ore is the main source for the production of vanadium. The vanadium ends up in pig iron produced from vanadium bearing magnetite. During steel production, oxygen is blown into the pig iron, oxidizing the carbon and most of the other impurities, forming slag. Depending on the ore used, the slag contains up to 25% of vanadium.</p>\n<p>Vanadium metal is obtained via a multistep process that begins with the roasting of crushed ore with NaCl or NaCO at about 850&nbsp;°C to give sodium metavanadate (NaVO). An aqueous extract of this solid is acidified to give \"red cake\", a polyvanadate salt, which is reduced with calcium metal. As an alternative for small-scale production, vanadium pentoxide is reduced with hydrogen or magnesium. Many other methods are also in use, in all of which vanadium is produced as a byproduct of other processes. Purification of vanadium is possible by the crystal bar process developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925. It involves the formation of the metal iodide, in this example vanadium(III) iodide, and the subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 V + 3 I  2 VI</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTool made from vanadium steel</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>Approximately 85% of vanadium produced is used as ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable increase of strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the beginning of the 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in a significant increase in the strength of the steel. From that time on vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium containing steel alloy groups. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium and high speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools.</p>\n<p>Vanadium stabilizes the beta form of titanium and increases the strength and temperature stability of titanium. Mixed with aluminium in titanium alloys it is used in jet engines, high-speed airframes and dental implants. One of the common alloys is Titanium 6AL-4V, a titanium alloy with 6% aluminium and 4% vanadium.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nVanadium(V) oxide is a catalyst in the contact process for producing sulfuric acid</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Vanadium is compatible with iron and titanium, therefore vanadium foil is used in cladding titanium to steel. The moderate thermal neutron-capture cross-section and the short half-life of the isotopes produced by neutron capture makes vanadium a suitable material for the inner structure of a fusion reactor. Several vanadium alloys show superconducting behavior. The first A15 phase superconductor was a vanadium compound, VSi, which was discovered in 1952. Vanadium-gallium tape is used in superconducting magnets (17.5 teslas or 175,000 gauss). The structure of the superconducting A15 phase of VGa is similar to that of the more common NbSn and NbTi.</p>\n<p>The most common oxide of vanadium, vanadium pentoxide VO, is used as a catalyst in manufacturing sulfuric acid by the contact process and as an oxidizer in maleic anhydride production. Vanadium pentoxide is also used in making ceramics. Another oxide of vanadium, vanadium dioxide VO, is used in the production of glass coatings, which blocks infrared radiation (and not visible light) at a specific temperature. Vanadium oxide can be used to induce color centers in corundum to create simulated alexandrite jewelry, although alexandrite in nature is a chrysoberyl. The possibility to use vanadium redox couples in both half-cells, thereby eliminating the problem of cross contamination by diffusion of ions across the membrane is the advantage of vanadium redox rechargeable batteries. Vanadate can be used for protecting steel against rust and corrosion by electrochemical conversion coating. Lithium vanadium oxide has been proposed for use as a high energy density anode for lithium ion batteries, at 745&nbsp;Wh/L when paired with a lithium cobalt oxide cathode. It has been proposed by some researchers that a small amount, 40 to 270&nbsp;ppm, of vanadium in Wootz steel and Damascus steel, significantly improves the strength of the material, although it is unclear what the source of the vanadium was.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Vanadium plays a very limited role in biology, and is more important in ocean environments than on land.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<i>Ascidiacea</i> (sea squirts) contain vanadium as vanabin.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTunicates such as this bluebell tunicate contain vanadium as vanabin.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<i>Amanita muscaria</i> contains amavadin.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Bromoperoxidases in algae</h3>\n<p>Organobromine compounds in a number of species of marine algae are generated by the action of a vanadium dependent bromoperoxidase. This is a haloperoxidase in algae which requires bromide and is an absolutely vanadium-dependent enzyme. Most organobromine compounds in the sea ultimately arise via the action of this vanadium bromoperoxidase.</p>\n<h3>Vanadium accumulation in tunicates and ascidians</h3>\n<p>German chemist Martin Henze discovered vanadium in the blood cells (or coelomic cells) of Ascidiacea (sea squirts) in 1911. It is essential to ascidians and tunicates, where it is stored in the highly acidified vacuoles of certain blood cell types, designated vanadocytes. Vanabins (vanadium binding proteins) have been identified in the cytoplasm of such cells. The concentration of vanadium in these ascidians' blood is up to ten million times higher than the concentration of vanadium in the seawater around them. The function of this vanadium concentration system, and these vanadium-containing proteins, is still unknown but the vanadocytes are later deposited just under the outer surface of the tunic where their presence may deter predation.</p>\n<h3>Nitrogen fixation</h3>\n<p>A vanadium nitrogenase is used by some nitrogen-fixing micro-organisms, such as <i>Azotobacter</i>. In this role vanadium replaces more common molybdenum or iron, and gives the nitrogenase slightly different properties.</p>\n<h3>Fungi</h3>\n<p>Several species of macrofungi, namely <i>Amanita muscaria</i> and related species, accumulate vanadium (up to 500&nbsp;mg/kg in dry weight). Vanadium is present in the coordination complex amavadin, in fungal fruit-bodies. However, the biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown. Toxin functions or peroxidase enzyme functions have been suggested.</p>\n<h3>Mammals and birds</h3>\n<p>Rats and chickens are also known to require vanadium in very small amounts and deficiencies result in reduced growth and impaired reproduction. Vanadium is a relatively controversial dietary supplement, primarily for increasing insulin sensitivity and body-building. Whether it works for the latter purpose has not been proven, and there is some evidence that athletes who take it are merely experiencing a placebo effect. Vanadyl sulfate may improve glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes. In addition, decavanadate and oxovanadates are species that potentially have many biological activities and that have been successfully used as tools in the comprehension of several biochemical processes.</p>\n<h2>Safety</h2>\n<p>All vanadium compounds should be considered toxic. Tetravalent VOSO has been reported to be over 5 times more toxic than trivalent VO. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05&nbsp;mg/m for vanadium pentoxide dust and 0.1&nbsp;mg/m for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35&nbsp;mg/m of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health. This is the exposure level of a chemical that is likely to cause permanent health problems or death.</p>\n<p>Vanadium compounds are poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal system. Inhalation exposures to vanadium and vanadium compounds result primarily in adverse effects on the respiratory system. Quantitative data are, however, insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation reference dose. Other effects have been reported after oral or inhalation exposures on blood parameters, on liver, on neurological development in rats, and other organs.</p>\n<p>There is little evidence that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. Vanadium pentoxide was reported to be carcinogenic in male rats and male and female mice by inhalation in an NTP study, although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed. Vanadium has not been classified as to carcinogenicity by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.</p>\n<p>Vanadium traces in diesel fuels present a corrosion hazard; it is the main fuel component influencing high temperature corrosion. During combustion, it oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, yielding vanadate compounds with melting points down to 530 °C, which attack the passivation layer on steel, rendering it susceptible to corrosion. The solid vanadium compounds also cause abrasion of engine components.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Vanadium redox battery</li>\n<li>Grid energy storage</li>\n<li>Vanadium(V) oxide</li>\n<li>Flow battery</li>\n<li>Vanadium tetrachloride</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Cintas, Pedro (2004). \"The Road to Chemical Names and Eponyms: Discovery, Priority, and Credit\".

  "title": "Chromium",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Chromium (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Chromium</b> is a chemical element which has the symbol <b>Cr</b> and atomic number 24. It is the first element in Group 6. It is a steely-gray, lustrous, hard and brittle metal which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point. Chromium is the hardest of all known metal elements in the periodic table, it is also odorless and tasteless. The name of the element is derived from the Greek word \"chrōma\" (χρώμα), meaning colour, because many of its compounds are intensely coloured.</p>\n<p>Chromium oxide was used by the Chinese in the Qin dynasty over 2,000 years ago to coat metal weapons found with the Terracotta Army. Chromium was discovered as an element after it came to the attention of the western world in the red crystalline mineral crocoite (lead(II) chromate), discovered in 1761 and initially used as a pigment. Louis Nicolas Vauquelin first isolated chromium metal from this mineral in 1797. Since Vauquelin's first production of metallic chromium, small amounts of native (free) chromium metal have been discovered in rare minerals, but these are not used commercially. Instead, nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the single commercially viable ore chromite, which is iron chromium oxide (FeCrO). Chromite is also now the chief source of chromium for chromium pigments.</p>\n<p>Chromium metal and ferrochromium alloy are commercially produced from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions, or by roasting and leaching processes. Chromium metal has proven of high value due to its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel. This application, along with chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) currently comprise 85% of the commercial use for the element, with applications for chromium compounds forming the remainder.</p>\n<p>Trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) ion is possibly required in trace amounts for sugar and lipid metabolism, although the issue remains in debate. In larger amounts and in different forms, chromium can be toxic and carcinogenic. The most prominent example of toxic chromium is hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). Abandoned chromium production sites often require environmental cleanup.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<p>Chromium is remarkable for its magnetic properties: it is the only elemental solid which shows antiferromagnetic ordering at room temperature (and below). Above 38 °C, it transforms into a paramagnetic state.</p>\n<h4>Passivation</h4>\n<p>Chromium metal left standing in air is passivated by oxygen, forming a thin protective oxide surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure only a few atoms thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying material. This barrier is in contrast to iron or plain carbon steels, where the oxygen migrates into the underlying material and causes rusting. The passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. The opposite effect can be achieved by treatment with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.</p>\n<p>Chromium, unlike metals such as iron and nickel, does not suffer from hydrogen embrittlement. However, it does suffer from nitrogen embrittlement, reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle nitrides at the high temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCrocoite (PbCrO)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChromite ore</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Chromium is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust with an average concentration of 100 ppm. Chromium compounds are found in the environment, due to erosion of chromium-containing rocks and can be distributed by volcanic eruptions. The concentrations range in soil is between 1 and 300&nbsp;mg/kg, in sea water 5 to 800&nbsp;µg/liter, and in rivers and lakes 26&nbsp;µg/liter to 5.2&nbsp;mg/liter. Chromium is mined as chromite (FeCrO) ore. About two-fifths of the chromite ores and concentrates in the world are produced in South Africa, while Kazakhstan, India, Russia, and Turkey are also substantial producers. Untapped chromite deposits are plentiful, but geographically concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa.</p>\n<p>Although rare, deposits of native chromium exist. The Udachnaya Pipe in Russia produces samples of the native metal. This mine is a kimberlite pipe, rich in diamonds, and the reducing environment helped produce both elemental chromium and diamond.</p>\n<p>The relation between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) strongly depends on pH and oxidative properties of the location, but in most cases, the Cr(III) is the dominating species, although in some areas the ground water can contain up to 39&nbsp;µg/liter of total chromium of which 30&nbsp;µg/liter is present as Cr(VI).</p>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of chromium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring chromium is composed of three stable isotopes; Cr, Cr and Cr with Cr being the most abundant (83.789% natural abundance). 19 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being Cr with a half-life of (more than) 1.8×10 years, and Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 24 hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 1 minute. This element also has 2 meta states.</p>\n<p>Cr is the radiogenic decay product of Mn. Chromium isotopic contents are typically combined with manganese isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology. Mn-Cr isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from Al and Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in Cr/Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial Mn/Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotopic composition must result from in-situ decay of Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence Cr provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.</p>\n<p>The isotopes of chromium range in atomic mass from 43&nbsp;u (Cr) to 67&nbsp;u (Cr). The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, Cr, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay. Cr has been posited as a proxy for atmospheric oxygen concentration.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n\n<p>Chromium is a member of the transition metals, in group 6. Chromium(0) has an electronic configuration of 4s3d, owing to the lower energy of the high spin configuration. Chromium exhibits a wide range of possible oxidation states, where the +3 state is most stable energetically; the +3 and +6 states are most commonly observed in chromium compounds, whereas the +1, +4 and +5 states are rare.</p>\n<p>The following is the Pourbaix diagram for chromium in pure water, perchloric acid or sodium hydroxide: </p>\n<h3>Chromium(III)</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChromium(III) chloride hexahydrate ([CrCl(HO)]Cl·2HO)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAnhydrous chromium(III) chloride (CrCl)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A large number of chromium(III) compounds are known. Chromium(III) can be obtained by dissolving elemental chromium in acids like hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. The Cr3+ ion has a similar radius (63&nbsp;pm) to the Al3+ ion (radius 50&nbsp;pm), so they can replace each other in some compounds, such as in chrome alum and alum. When a trace amount of Cr3+ replaces Al3+ in corundum (aluminium oxide, AlO), the red-colored ruby is formed.</p>\n<p>Chromium(III) ions tend to form octahedral complexes. The colors of these complexes is determined by the ligands attached to the Cr centre. The commercially available chromium(III) chloride hydrate is the dark green complex [CrCl(HO)]Cl. Closely related compounds have different colours: pale green [CrCl(HO)]Cl and the violet [Cr(HO)]Cl. If water-free green chromium(III) chloride is dissolved in water then the green solution turns violet after some time, due to the substitution of water by chloride in the inner coordination sphere. This kind of reaction is also observed with solutions of chrome alum and other water-soluble chromium(III) salts.</p>\n<p>Chromium(III) hydroxide (Cr(OH)) is amphoteric, dissolving in acidic solutions to form [Cr(HO)], and in basic solutions to form [Cr(OH)\n6]3−. It is dehydrated by heating to form the green chromium(III) oxide (CrO), which is the stable oxide with a crystal structure identical to that of corundum.</p>\n<h3>Chromium(VI)</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChromium(VI) oxide</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Chromium(VI) compounds are powerful oxidants at low or neutral pH. Most important are chromate anion (CrO2−\n4) and dichromate (CrO) anions, which exist in equilibrium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 [CrO] + 2 H  [CrO] + HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Chromium(VI) halides are known also and include the hexafluoride CrF and chromyl chloride (CrO\n2Cl\n2).</p>\n<p>Sodium chromate is produced industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with calcium or sodium carbonate. The dominant species is therefore, by the law of mass action, determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.</p>\n<p>Both the chromate and dichromate anions are strong oxidizing reagents at low pH:</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSodium chromate (NaCrO)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<dl>\n<dd>Cr\n2O2−\n7 + 14 H\n3O+ + 6 e → 2 Cr3+ + 21 H\n2O (ε = 1.33&nbsp;V)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>They are, however, only moderately oxidizing at high pH:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>CrO2−\n4 + 4 H\n2O + 3 e → Cr(OH)\n3 + 5 OH− (ε = −0.13&nbsp;V)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Chromium(VI) compounds in solution can be detected by adding an acidic hydrogen peroxide solution. The unstable dark blue chromium(VI) peroxide (CrO) is formed, which can be stabilized as an ether adduct CrO\n5·OR\n2.</p>\n<p>Chromic acid has the hypothetical formula H\n2CrO\n4. It is a vaguely described chemical, despite many well-defined chromates and dichromates being known. The dark red chromium(VI) oxide CrO\n3, the acid anhydride of chromic acid, is sold industrially as \"chromic acid\". It can be produced by mixing sulfuric acid with dichromate, and is a strong oxidizing agent.</p>\n<h3>Chromium(V) and chromium(IV)</h3>\n<p>The oxidation state +5 is only realized in few compounds but are intermediates in many reactions involving oxidations by chromate. The only binary compound is the volatile chromium(V) fluoride (CrF). This red solid has a melting point of 30 °C and a boiling point of 117 °C. It can be synthesized by treating chromium metal with fluorine at 400 °C and 200 bar pressure. The peroxochromate(V) is another example of the +5 oxidation state. Potassium peroxochromate (K[Cr(O)]) is made by reacting potassium chromate with hydrogen peroxide at low temperatures. This red brown compound is stable at room temperature but decomposes spontaneously at 150–170&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<p>Compounds of chromium(IV) (in the +4 oxidation state) are slightly more common than those of chromium(V). The tetrahalides, CrF, CrCl, and CrBr, can be produced by treating the trihalides (CrX\n3) with the corresponding halogen at elevated temperatures. Such compounds are susceptible to disproportionation reactions and are not stable in water.</p>\n<h3>Chromium(II)</h3>\n<p>Many chromium(II) compounds are known, including the water-stable chromium(II) chloride, CrCl\n2, which can be made by reduction of chromium(III) chloride with zinc. The resulting bright blue solution is only stable at neutral pH. Many chromous carboxylates are also known, most famously, the red chromous acetate (Cr(OCCH)), which features a quadruple bond.</p>\n<h3>Chromium(I)</h3>\n<p>Most Cr(I) compounds are obtained by oxidation of electron-rich, octahedral Cr(0) complexes. Other Cr(I) complexes contain cyclopentadienyl ligands. As verified by X-ray diffraction, a Cr-Cr quintuple bond (length 183.51(4) &nbsp;pm) has also been described. Extremely bulky monodentate ligands stabilize this compound by shielding the quintuple bond from further reactions.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChromium compound determined experimentally to contain a Cr-Cr quintuple bond</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Chromium(0)</h3>\n<div>Main article: organochromium chemistry</div>\n<p>Many chromium(0) compounds are known. Most are derivatives of chromium hexacarbonyl or bis(benzene)chromium.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Weapons found in burial pits dating from the late 3rd century B.C. Qin Dynasty of the Terracotta Army near Xi'an, China have been analyzed by archaeologists. Although buried more than 2,000 years ago, the ancient bronze tips of crossbow bolts and swords found at the site showed unexpectedly little corrosion, possibly because the bronze was deliberately coated with a thin layer of chromium oxide. However, this oxide layer was not chromium metal or chrome plating as we know it.</p>\n<p>Chromium minerals as pigments came to the attention of the west in the 18th century. On 26 July 1761, Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Beryozovskoye mines in the Ural Mountains which he named <i>Siberian red lead</i>. Though misidentified as a lead compound with selenium and iron components, the mineral was in fact crocoite (<i>lead chromate</i>) with a formula of PbCrO.</p>\n<p>In 1770, Peter Simon Pallas visited the same site as Lehmann and found a red lead mineral that had useful properties as a pigment in paints. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment then developed rapidly. A bright yellow pigment made from crocoite also became fashionable.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe red colour of rubies is from a small amount of chromium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 1797, Louis Nicolas Vauquelin received samples of crocoite ore. He produced chromium trioxide (CrO) by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid. In 1798, Vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven, making him the discoverer of the element. Vauquelin was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious gemstones, such as ruby or emerald.</p>\n<p>During the 1800s, chromium was primarily used as a component of paints and in tanning salts. At first, crocoite from Russia was the main source, but in 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near Baltimore, United States. This made the United States the largest producer of chromium products till 1848 when large deposits of chromite were found near Bursa, Turkey.</p>\n<p>Chromium is also known for its luster when polished. It is used as a protective and decorative coating on car parts, plumbing fixtures, furniture parts and many other items, usually applied by electroplating. Chromium was used for electroplating as early as 1848, but this use only became widespread with the development of an improved process in 1924.</p>\n<p>Metal alloys now account for 85% of the use of chromium. The remainder is used in the chemical industry and refractory and foundry industries.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPiece of chromium produced with aluminothermic reaction</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld production trend of chromium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nchromium, remelted in a horizontal arc zone-refiner, showing large visible crystal grains</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Approximately 4.4 million metric tons of marketable chromite ore were produced in 2000, and converted into ~3.3 million tons of ferro-chrome with an approximate market value of 2.5 billion United States dollars. The largest producers of chromium ore have been South Africa (44%) India (18%), Kazakhstan (16%) Zimbabwe (5%), Finland (4%) Iran (4%) and Brazil (2%) with several other countries producing the rest of less than 10% of the world production.</p>\n<p>The two main products of chromium ore refining are ferrochromium and metallic chromium. For those products the ore smelter process differs considerably. For the production of ferrochromium, the chromite ore (FeCrO) is reduced in large scale in electric arc furnace or in smaller smelters with either aluminium or silicon in an aluminothermic reaction.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChromium ore output in 2002</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>For the production of pure chromium, the iron has to be separated from the chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable FeO. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 FeCrO + 8 NaCO + 7 O → 8 NaCrO + 2 FeO + 8 CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 NaCrO + HSO → NaCrO + NaSO + HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The dichromate is converted to the chromium(III) oxide by reduction with carbon and then reduced in an aluminothermic reaction to chromium.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>NaCrO + 2 C → CrO + NaCO + CO</dd>\n<dd>CrO + 2 Al → AlO + 2 Cr</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Metallurgy</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDecorative chrome plating on a motorcycle.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Chrome plating</div>\n<p>The strengthening effect of forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries and the strong increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-proof metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium is added to the molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.</p>\n<p>The relative high hardness and corrosion resistance of unalloyed chromium makes it a good surface coating, being still the most \"popular\" metal coating with unparalleled combined durability. A thin layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by electroplating techniques. There are two deposition methods: Thin, below 1&nbsp;µm thickness, layers are deposited by chrome plating, and are used for decorative surfaces. If wear-resistant surfaces are needed then thicker chromium layers are deposited. Both methods normally use acidic chromate or dichromate solutions. To prevent the energy-consuming change in oxidation state, the use of chromium(III) sulfate is under development, but for most applications, the established process is used.</p>\n<p>In the chromate conversion coating process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This passivation and the self-healing properties by the chromate stored in the chromate conversion coating, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method. Because of environmental and health regulations on chromates, alternative coating method are under development.</p>\n<p>Anodizing of aluminium is another electrochemical process, which does not lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses chromic acid as electrolyte in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers. The high toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds, used in the established chromium electroplating process, and the strengthening of safety and environmental regulations demand a search for substitutes for chromium or at least a change to less toxic chromium(III) compounds.</p>\n<h3>Dye and pigment</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSchool bus painted in chrome yellow</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The mineral crocoite (lead chromate PbCrO) was used as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO·Pb(OH)). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15&nbsp;µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.</p>\n<p>Chromium oxides are also used as a green color in glassmaking and as a glaze in ceramics. Green chromium oxide is extremely light-fast and as such is used in cladding coatings. It is also the main ingredient in IR reflecting paints, used by the armed forces, to paint vehicles, to give them the same IR reflectance as green leaves.</p>\n<h4>Synthetic ruby and the first laser</h4>\n<p>Natural rubies are corundum (aluminum oxide) crystals that are colored red (the rarest type) due to chromium (III) ions (other colors of corundum gems are termed sapphires). A red-colored artificial ruby may also be achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies. Such a synthetic ruby crystal was the basis for the first laser, produced in 1960, which relied on stimulated emission of light from the chromium atoms in such a crystal.</p>\n<h3>Wood preservative</h3>\n<p>Because of their toxicity, chromium(VI) salts are used for the preservation of wood. For example, chromated copper arsenate (CCA) is used in timber treatment to protect wood from decay fungi, wood attacking insects, including termites, and marine borers. The formulations contain chromium based on the oxide CrO between 35.3% and 65.5%. In the United States, 65,300 metric tons of CCA solution have been used in 1996.</p>\n<h3>Tanning</h3>\n<div>Main article: Tanning</div>\n<p>Chromium(III) salts, especially chrome alum and chromium(III) sulfate, are used in the tanning of leather. The chromium(III) stabilizes the leather by cross linking the collagen fibers. Chromium tanned leather can contain between 4 and 5% of chromium, which is tightly bound to the proteins. Although the form of chromium used for tanning is not the toxic hexavalent variety, there remains interest in management of chromium in the tanning industry such as recovery and reuse, direct/indirect recycling, use of less chromium or \"chrome-less\" tanning are practiced to better manage chromium in tanning.</p>\n<h3>Refractory material</h3>\n<p>The high heat resistivity and high melting point makes chromite and chromium(III) oxide a material for high temperature refractory applications, like blast furnaces, cement kilns, molds for the firing of bricks and as foundry sands for the casting of metals. In these applications, the refractory materials are made from mixtures of chromite and magnesite. The use is declining because of the environmental regulations due to the possibility of the formation of chromium(VI).</p>\n<h3>Catalysts</h3>\n<p>Several chromium compounds are used as catalysts for processing hydrocarbons. For example the Phillips catalysts for the production of polyethylene are mixtures of chromium and silicon dioxide or mixtures of chromium and titanium and aluminium oxide. Fe-Cr mixed oxides are employed as high-temperature catalysts for the water gas shift reaction. Copper chromite is a useful hydrogenation catalyst.</p>\n<h3>Other use</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Chromium(IV) oxide (CrO) is a magnetic compound. Its ideal shape anisotropy, which imparts high coercivity and remnant magnetization, made it a compound superior to the γ-FeO. Chromium(IV) oxide is used to manufacture magnetic tape used in high-performance audio tape and standard audio cassettes. Chromates can prevent corrosion of steel under wet conditions, and therefore chromates are added to drilling muds.</li>\n<li>Chromium(III) oxide is a metal polish known as green rouge.</li>\n<li>Chromic acid is a powerful oxidizing agent and is a useful compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any trace of organic compounds. It is prepared <i>in situ</i> by dissolving potassium dichromate in concentrated sulfuric acid, which is then used to wash the apparatus. Sodium dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility (50 g/L versus 200 g/L respectively). Potassium dichromate is a chemical reagent, used in cleaning laboratory glassware and as a titrating agent. It is also used as a mordant (i.e., a fixing agent) for dyes in fabric.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>Main article: Chromium deficiency</div>\n<p>Trivalent chromium (Cr(III) or Cr) occurs in trace amounts in foods and waters, and appears to be benign. In contrast, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) or Cr) is very toxic and mutagenic when inhaled. Cr(VI) has not been established as a carcinogen when in solution, although it may cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).</p>\n<p>Chromium deficiency, involving a lack of Cr(III) in the body, or perhaps some complex of it, such as glucose tolerance factor is controversial, or is at least extremely rare. Chromium has no verified biological role and has been classified by some as <i>not</i> essential for mammals. However, other reviews have regarded it as an essential trace element in humans.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWatch glass holds two grams of pure chromium (III) picolinate powder manufactured by NUTRITION 21 as a dietary supplement. It is a reddish crystalline powder, 12.5% Cr(III) by weight, very sparingly soluble in water.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Chromium deficiency has been attributed to only three people on long-term parenteral nutrition, which is when a patient is fed a liquid diet through intravenous drips for long periods of time.</p>\n<p>Although no biological role for chromium has ever been demonstrated, dietary supplements for chromium include chromium(III) picolinate, chromium(III) polynicotinate, and related materials. The benefit of those supplements is questioned by some studies. The use of chromium-containing dietary supplements is controversial, owing to the absence of any verified biological role, the expense of these supplements, and the complex effects of their use. The popular dietary supplement chromium picolinate complex generates chromosome damage in hamster cells (due to the picolinate ligand). In the United States the dietary guidelines for daily chromium uptake were lowered in 2001 from 50–200 µg for an adult to 35&nbsp;µg (adult male) and to 25&nbsp;µg (adult female).</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<div>Main article: Chromium toxicity</div>\n<p>Water insoluble chromium(III) compounds and chromium metal are not considered a health hazard, while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of chromium(VI) have been known for a long time. Because of the specific transport mechanisms, only limited amounts of <b>chromium(III)</b> enter the cells. Several <i>in vitro</i> studies indicated that high concentrations of chromium(III) in the cell can lead to DNA damage. Acute oral toxicity ranges between 1.5 and 3.3&nbsp;mg/kg. The proposed beneficial effects of chromium(III) and the use as dietary supplements yielded some controversial results, but recent reviews suggest that moderate uptake of chromium(III) through dietary supplements poses no risk.</p>\n<h3>Cr(VI)</h3>\n<p>The acute oral toxicity for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150&nbsp;µg/kg. In the body, chromium(VI) is reduced by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong oxidational properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. Hemolysis, renal and liver failure are the results of these damages. Aggressive dialysis can improve the situation.</p>\n<p>The carcinogenity of chromate dust is known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.</p>\n<p>Chromium salts (chromates) are also the cause of allergic reactions in some people. Chromates are often used to manufacture, amongst other things, leather products, paints, cement, mortar and anti-corrosives. Contact with products containing chromates can lead to allergic contact dermatitis and irritant dermatitis, resulting in ulceration of the skin, sometimes referred to as \"chrome ulcers\". This condition is often found in workers that have been exposed to strong chromate solutions in electroplating, tanning and chrome-producing manufacturers.</p>\n<h3>Environmental issues</h3>\n<p>As chromium compounds were used in dyes and paints and the tanning of leather, these compounds are often found in soil and groundwater at abandoned industrial sites, now needing environmental cleanup and remediation per the treatment of brownfield land. Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for aerospace and automobile refinishing applications.</p>\n<p>In 2010, the Environmental Working Group studied the drinking water in 35 American cities. The study was the first nationwide analysis measuring the presence of the chemical in U.S. water systems. The study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities sampled, with Norman, Oklahoma, at the top of list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's proposed limit. Note: Concentrations of Cr(VI) in US municipal drinking water supplies reported by EWG are within likely, natural background levels for the areas tested and not necessarily indicative of industrial pollution (CalEPA Fact Sheet), as asserted by EWG. This factor was not taken into consideration in their report.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Chromium compounds</li>\n<li>Chromium minerals</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Most common oxidation states of chromium are in bold.

  "title": "Manganese",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with Magnesium.</div>\n<div>For other uses, see Manganese (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Manganese</b> is a chemical element, designated by the symbol <b>Mn</b>. It has the atomic number 25. It is found as a free element in nature (often in combination with iron), and in many minerals. Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels.</p>\n<p>Historically, manganese is named for various black minerals (such as pyrolusite) from the same region of Magnesia in Greece which gave names to similar-sounding magnesium, Mg, and magnetite, an ore of the element iron, Fe. By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but they were not able to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, by reducing the dioxide with carbon.</p>\n<p>Manganese phosphating is used as a treatment for rust and corrosion prevention on steel. Depending on their oxidation state, manganese ions have various colors and are used industrially as pigments. The permanganates of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries.</p>\n<p>In biology, manganese(II) ions function as cofactors for a large variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants. The element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms. In larger amounts, and apparently with far greater activity by inhalation, manganese can cause a poisoning syndrome in mammals, with neurological damage which is sometimes irreversible.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nElectrolytically refined manganese chips and 1 cm cube</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Manganese is a silvery-gray metal that resembles iron. It is hard and very brittle, difficult to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic. Manganese tarnishes slowly in air and \"rusts\" like iron, in water containing dissolved oxygen.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of manganese</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable isotope, Mn. Eighteen radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being Mn with a half-life of 3.7 million years, Mn with a half-life of 312.3 days, and Mn with a half-life of 5.591 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than three hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than one minute. This element also has three meta states.</p>\n<p>Manganese is part of the iron group of elements, which are thought to be synthesized in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion. Mn decays to Cr with a half-life of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, Mn occurs only in tiny amounts due to the action of cosmic rays on iron in rocks. Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating. Mn–Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from Al and Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in Cr/Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial Mn/Mn ratio that suggests Mn–Cr isotopic composition must result from <i>in situ</i> decay of Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence Mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.</p>\n<p>The isotopes of manganese range in atomic weight from 46 u (Mn) to 65 u (Mn). The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, Mn, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>The most common oxidation states of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6 and +7, though oxidation states from −3 to +7 are observed. Mn often competes with Mg in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are restricted to the unstable oxide MnO and compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO, are powerful oxidizing agents. Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportionation.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nManganese(II) chloride crystals – the pale pink color of Mn (II) salts is due to a spin-forbidden 3d transition, which is rare.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAqueous solution of KMnO illustrating the deep purple of Mn(VII) as it occurs in permanganate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The most stable oxidation state for manganese is +2, which has a pale pink color, and many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as manganese(II) sulfate (MnSO) and manganese(II) chloride (MnCl). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite (manganese(II) carbonate). The +2 oxidation state is the state used in living organisms for essential functions; other states are toxic for the human body. The +2 oxidation of Mn results from removal of the two <b>4s</b> electrons, leaving a \"high spin\" ion in which all five of the <b>3d</b> orbitals contain a single electron. Absorption of visible light by this ion is accomplished only by a spin-forbidden transition in which one of the d electrons must pair with another, to give the atom a change in spin of two units. The unlikeliness of such a transition is seen in the uniformly pale and almost colorless nature of Mn(II) compounds relative to other oxidation states of manganese.</p>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>The +3 oxidation state is known in compounds like manganese(III) acetate, but these are quite powerful oxidizing agents and also prone to disproportionation in solution to manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by their preference for distorted octahedral coordination due to the Jahn-Teller effect and its strong purple-red color.</p>\n<p>The oxidation state 5+ can be obtained if manganese dioxide is dissolved in molten sodium nitrite. Manganate (VI) salts can also be produced by dissolving Mn compounds, such as manganese dioxide, in molten alkali while exposed to air.</p>\n<p>Permanganate (+7 oxidation state) compounds are purple, and can give glass a violet color. Potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers. Potassium permanganate, also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties and finds use as a topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives to be used in the preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The origin of the name manganese is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from Magnesia in what is now modern Greece, were both called <i>magnes</i> from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male <i>magnes</i> attracted iron, and was the iron ore we now know as lodestone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female <i>magnes</i> ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine <i>magnes</i> was later called <i>magnesia</i>, known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide. Neither this mineral nor manganese itself is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called ma<b>n</b>ga<b>n</b>esum (note the two n's instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a <i>mag<b>n</b>esia <b>n</b>egra</i> (the black ore) from <i>mag<b>n</b>esia alba</i> (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called magnesia negra <i>manganesa</i>, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as <i>manganese</i> (German: <i>Mangan</i>). The name <i>magnesia</i> eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for that free element, when it was eventually isolated, much later.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSome of the cave paintings in Lascaux, France, use manganese-based pigments.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Several oxides of manganese, for example manganese dioxide, are abundant in nature, and owing to their color, these oxides have been used as since the Stone Age. The cave paintings in Gargas contain manganese as pigments and these cave paintings are 30,000 to 24,000 years old.</p>\n<p>Manganese compounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glassmakers, to either remove color from glass or add color to it. The use as \"glassmakers soap\" continued through the Middle Ages until modern times and is evident in 14th-century glass from Venice.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCredit for first isolating manganese is usually given to Johan Gottlieb Gahn.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Because of the use in glassmaking, manganese dioxide was available to alchemists, the first chemists, and was used for experiments. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate, a useful laboratory reagent. By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite containing bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.</p>\n<p>Scheele and other chemists were aware that manganese dioxide contained a new element, but they were not able to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, by reducing the dioxide with carbon.</p>\n<p>The manganese content of some iron ores used in Greece led to the speculations that the steel produced from that ore contains inadvertent amounts of manganese, making the Spartan steel exceptionally hard. Around the beginning of the 19th century, manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted. In 1816, it was noted that adding manganese to iron made it harder, without making it any more brittle. In 1837, British academic James Couper noted an association between heavy exposures to manganese in mines with a form of Parkinson's disease. In 1912, manganese phosphating electrochemical conversion coatings for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion were patented in the United States, and have seen widespread use ever since.</p>\n<p>The invention of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand of manganese dioxide. Until the introduction of the nickel-cadmium battery and lithium-containing batteries, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide, because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese dioxide has seen wide commercial use as the chief cathodic material for commercial disposable dry cells and dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<div>See also: Category:Manganese minerals</div>\n<p>Manganese makes up about 1000&nbsp;ppm&nbsp;(0.1%) of the Earth's crust, making it the 12th most abundant element there. Soil contains 7–9000&nbsp;ppm of manganese with an average of 440&nbsp;ppm. Seawater has only 10&nbsp;ppm manganese and the atmosphere contains 0.01&nbsp;µg/m. Manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite (MnO), braunite, (MnMn)(SiO), psilomelane (Ba,HO)MnO, and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite (MnCO).</p>\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPercentage of manganese output in 2006 by countries</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The most important manganese ore is pyrolusite (MnO). Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial relation to the iron ores. Land-based resources are large but irregularly distributed. About 80% of the known world manganese resources are found in South Africa; other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine, Australia, India, China, Gabon and Brazil. In 1978, 500 billion tons of manganese nodules were estimated to exist on the ocean floor. Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the 1970s. For a Cold War ruse, the CIA had had billionaire Howard Hughes commission a ship, the <i>Hughes Glomar Explorer</i> to go to Hawaii to harvest manganese nodules. That ship started a rush of people who wanted to collect manganese nodules from the bottom of the sea, which is impractical. The <i>Hughes Glomar Explorer</i> was actually built to raise a sunken Russian submarine, the K-129. Sadly for the CIA, the part of the submarine containing the code books broke off while it was being raised, so they did not get what they wanted.</p>\n<p>Manganese is mined in South Africa, Australia, China, Brazil, Gabon, Ukraine, India and Ghana and Kazakhstan. US Import Sources (1998–2001): Manganese ore: Gabon, 70%; South Africa, 10%; Australia, 9%; Mexico, 5%; and other, 6%. Ferromanganese: South Africa, 47%; France, 22%; Mexico, 8%; Australia, 8%; and other, 15%. Manganese contained in all manganese imports: South Africa, 31%; Gabon, 21%; Australia, 13%; Mexico, 8%; and other, 27%.</p>\n<p>For the production of ferromanganese, the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%. Pure manganese used for the production of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications, which are related to metallurgical alloy use. In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes.</p>\n<h3>Steel</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUS Marine Corps steel helmet</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Among a variety of other uses, manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel formulations.</p>\n<p>Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures, because it forms a high melting sulfide and therefore prevents the formation of a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese can have a high tensile strength of up to 863&nbsp;MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was used for British steel helmets. This steel composition was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel.</p>\n<h3>Aluminium alloys</h3>\n<div>Main article: Aluminium alloy</div>\n<p>The second large application for manganese is as alloying agent for aluminium. Aluminium with a manganese content of roughly 1.5% has an increased resistance against corrosion due to the formation of grains absorbing impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion. The corrosion-resistant aluminium alloys 3004 and 3104 with a manganese content of 0.8 to 1.5% are the alloys used for most of the beverage cans. Before year 2000, more than 1.6 million tonnes have been used of those alloys; with a content of 1% manganese, this amount would need 16,000 tonnes of manganese.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl is used as an additive in unleaded gasoline to boost octane rating and reduce engine knocking. The manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.</p>\n<p>Manganese(IV) oxide (manganese dioxide, MnO) is used as a reagent in organic chemistry for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols (i.e. adjacent to an aromatic ring). Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidatively neutralize the greenish tinge in glass caused by trace amounts of iron contamination. MnO is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine, and in drying black paints. In some preparations, it is a brown pigment that can be used to make paint and is a constituent of natural umber.</p>\n<p>Manganese(IV) oxide was used in the original type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc, and is the blackish material found when opening carbon–zinc type flashlight cells. The manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide-hydroxide MnO(OH) during discharging, preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>MnO + HO + -\ne → MnO(OH) + OH−</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The same material also functions in newer alkaline batteries (usually battery cells), which use the same basic reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000&nbsp;tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld-War-II-era 5-cent coin (1942-5 identified by mint mark P,D or S above dome) made from a 56% copper-35% silver-9% manganese alloy</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The metal is very occasionally used in coins; until 2000, the only United States coin to use manganese was the \"wartime\" nickel from 1942 to 1945. An alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel was traditionally used for the production of nickel coins. However, because of shortage of nickel metal during the war, it was substituted by more available silver and manganese, thus resulting in an alloy of 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese. Since 2000, dollar coins, for example the Sacagawea dollar and the Presidential $1 coins, are made from a brass containing 7% of manganese with a pure copper core. In both cases of nickel and dollar, the use of manganese in the coin was to duplicate the electromagnetic properties of a previous identically sized and valued coin, for vending purposes. In the case of the later U.S. dollar coins, the manganese alloy was an attempt to duplicate properties of the copper/nickel alloy used in the previous Susan B. Anthony dollar.</p>\n<p>Manganese compounds have been used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes based on manganese compounds. In the glass industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III). Larger amounts of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nReactive center of arginase with boronic acid inhibitor – the manganese atoms are shown in yellow.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Manganese is an essential trace nutrient in all forms of life. The classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors are very broad, and include oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, lectins, and integrins. The reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses (though not lentiviruses such as HIV) contain manganese. The best-known manganese-containing polypeptides may be arginase, the diphtheria toxin, and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD).</p>\n<p>Mn-SOD is the type of SOD present in eukaryotic mitochondria, and also in most bacteria (this fact is in keeping with the bacterial-origin theory of mitochondria). The Mn-SOD enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide, formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. Exceptions include a few kinds of bacteria, such as <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> and related lactobacilli, which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism, involving manganese (Mn) ions complexed with polyphosphate directly for this task, indicating how this function possibly evolved in aerobic life.</p>\n<p>The human body contains about 12&nbsp;mg of manganese, which is stored mainly in the bones; in the tissue, it is mostly concentrated in the liver and kidneys. In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes.</p>\n<p>Manganese is also important in photosynthetic oxygen evolution in chloroplasts in plants. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) is a part of photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for the terminal photooxidation of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis, and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese. For this reason, most broad-spectrum plant fertilizers contain manganese.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Manganese compounds are less toxic than those of other widespread metals, such as nickel and copper. However, exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of 5&nbsp;mg/m even for short periods because of its toxicity level. Manganese poisoning has been linked to impaired motor skills and cognitive disorders.</p>\n<p>The permanganate exhibits a higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10&nbsp;g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane. For example, the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only a limited amount is absorbed by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.</p>\n<p>In 2005, a study suggested a possible link between manganese inhalation and central nervous system toxicity in rats.</p>\n<p>Manganese exposure in United States is regulated by Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</p>\n<p>Generally, exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5 μg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms. Increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity, characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase leakage.</p>\n<h2>Environmental health concerns</h2>\n<h3>Manganese in drinking water</h3>\n<p>Waterborne manganese has a greater bioavailability than dietary manganese. According to results from a 2010 study, higher levels of exposure to manganese in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school-age children. It is hypothesized that long-term exposure to the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to 8.7 million Americans at risk.</p>\n<h3>Manganese in gasoline</h3>\n<p>Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) is a gasoline additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines, to improve the octane number in low octane number petrol distillates. It functions as an antiknock agent by the action of the carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need to use lead or manganese compounds is merely historic, as the availability of reformation processes which create high-octane rating fuels increased. The use of such fuels directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates is universal in developed countries (EU, Japan, etc.). In USA the imperative to provide the lowest possible price per volume on motor fuels (low fuel taxation rate) and lax legislation of fuel content (before 2000) caused refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel (cart, minibike). MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. There is strong correlation between elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations and automobile traffic density.</p>\n<h2>Role in neurological disorders</h2>\n<h3>Manganism</h3>\n<p>Manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with manganism, a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations. The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were manganese grinders.</p>\n<p>Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In its early stages, an intoxicated person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms give way to late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.</p>\n<h3>Childhood developmental disorders</h3>\n<p>Several recent studies attempt to examine the effects of chronic low-dose manganese overexposure on development in children. The earliest study of this kind was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350&nbsp;µg Mn/L. Although WMn concentrations at or below 300&nbsp;µg Mn/L are considered safe by the US EPA and 400&nbsp;µg Mn/L are considered safe by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification when compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between WMn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610&nbsp;µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160&nbsp;µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behaviors.</p>\n<h3>Neurodegenerative diseases</h3>\n<p>Chronic low-dose manganese intoxication is strongly implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It may also play a role in the development of multiple sclerosis, restless leg syndrome, and Huntington's disease. A protein called DMT1 is the major transporter involved in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese across the blood–brain barrier. DMT1 also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium. The putative mechanism of action is that manganese overexposure and/or dysregulation lead to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Parkerize</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Roth, Jerome; Ponzoni, Silvia; Aschner, Michael (2013). \"Chapter 6 Manganese Homeostasis and Transport\".

  "title": "Iron",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the metallic element.  For other uses, see Iron (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Iron</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Fe</b> (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is the most common element (by mass) forming the planet Earth as a whole, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Iron's very common presence in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production as a result of fusion in high-mass stars, where the production of nickel-56 (which decays to the most common isotope of iron) is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is exothermic. This causes radioactive nickel to become the last element to be produced before collapse of a supernova leads to the explosive events that scatter this precursor radionuclide of iron abundantly into space.</p>\n<p>Like other group 8 elements, iron exists in a wide range of oxidation states, −2 to +6, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike many other metals which form passivating oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than iron metal, and thus iron oxides flake off and expose fresh surfaces for corrosion.</p>\n<p>Iron metal has been used since ancient times, though copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used first in history. Pure iron is soft (softer than aluminium), but is unobtainable by smelting. The material is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities from the smelting process, such as carbon. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000&nbsp;times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and low carbon iron alloys with other metals (alloy steels) are by far the most common metals in industrial use, due to their great range of desirable properties and the abundance of iron.</p>\n<p>Iron chemical compounds, which include ferrous and ferric compounds, have many uses. Iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to create a thermite reaction, used in welding and purifying ores. It forms binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens. Among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene, the first sandwich compound discovered.</p>\n<p>Iron plays an important role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also the metal used at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Mechanical properties</h3>\n\n<p>The mechanical properties of iron and its alloys can be evaluated using a variety of tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the mechanical properties of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure research-purpose single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30&nbsp;Brinell. An increase in the carbon content of the iron will initially cause a significant corresponding increase in the iron's hardness and tensile strength. Maximum hardness of 65 R is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although this produces a metal with a low tensile strength.</p>\n<h3>Phase diagram and allotropes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Allotropes of iron</div>\n<p>Iron represents an example of allotropy in a metal. There are at least four allotropic forms of iron, known as α, γ, δ, and ε; at very high pressures, some controversial experimental evidence exists for a phase β stable at very high pressures and temperatures.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLow-pressure phase diagram of pure iron</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As molten iron cools down it crystallizes at 1538&nbsp;°C into its δ allotrope, which has a body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure. As it cools further its crystal structure changes to face-centered cubic (fcc) at 1394&nbsp;°C, when it is known as γ-iron, or austenite. At 912&nbsp;°C the crystal structure again becomes bcc as α-iron, or ferrite, is formed, and at 770&nbsp;°C (the Curie point, T) iron becomes magnetic. As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in \"domain structure\", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; the neighboring domains point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighboring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about 10&nbsp;micrometres across. At pressures above approximately 10 GPa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, α-iron changes into a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure, which is also known as ε-iron; the higher-temperature γ-phase also changes into ε-iron, but does so at higher pressure. The β-phase, if it exists, would appear at pressures of at least 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K; it has been thought to have an orthorhombic or a double hcp structure.</p>\n<p>Iron is of greatest importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties, and an understanding of the properties of the allotropes of iron is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.</p>\n<p>α-iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910&nbsp;°C).</p>\n<p>Above 912&nbsp;°C and up to 1400&nbsp;°C α-iron undergoes a phase transition from bcc to the fcc configuration of γ-iron, also called austenite. This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146&nbsp;°C). This form of iron is used in the type of stainless steel used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.</p>\n<p>The high-pressure phases of iron are important as endmember models for the solid parts of planetary cores. The inner core of the Earth is generally assumed to consist essentially of an iron-nickel alloy with ε (or β) structure.</p>\n<p>The melting point of iron is experimentally well defined for pressures up to approximately 50 GPa. For higher pressures, different studies placed the γ-ε-liquid triple point at pressures differing by tens of gigapascals and yielded differences of more than 1000 K for the melting point. Generally speaking, molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points and a much steeper slope of the melting curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of iron</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring iron consists of four stable isotopes: 5.845% of Fe, 91.754% of Fe, 2.119% of Fe and 0.282% of Fe. Of these stable isotopes, only Fe has a nuclear spin (−1/2). The nuclide Fe is predicted to undergo double beta decay, but this process had never been observed experimentally for these nuclei, and only the lower limit on the half-life was established: <i>t</i>&gt;3.1×10 years.</p>\n<p>Fe is an extinct radionuclide of long half-life (2.6&nbsp;million years). It is not found on Earth, but its ultimate decay product is the stable nuclide nickel-60.</p>\n<p>Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has focused on determining Fe variations due to processes accompanying nucleosynthesis (i.e., meteorite studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in mass spectrometry technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the stable isotopes of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the Earth and planetary science communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge.</p>\n<p>The most abundant iron isotope Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists as it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis. It is often cited, falsely, as the isotope of highest binding energy, a distinction which actually belongs to nickel-62. Since Ni is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see silicon burning process), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars, since addition of another alpha particle would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6&nbsp;days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight.</p>\n<p>In phases of the meteorites <i>Semarkona</i> and <i>Chervony Kut</i> a correlation between the concentration of Ni, the daughter product of Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of Fe at the time of formation of the Solar System. Possibly the energy released by the decay of Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide Al, to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 4.6&nbsp;billion years ago. The abundance of Ni present in extraterrestrial material may also provide further insight into the origin of the Solar System and its early history.</p>\n<p>Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the nickel isotope Ni. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favored. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production.</p>\n<p>Iron-56 is the heaviest stable isotope produced by the alpha process in stellar nucleosynthesis; elements heavier than iron and nickel require a supernova for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of red giants, and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth.</p>\n<h3>Nucleosynthesis</h3>\n<p>Iron is created by extremely large, extremely hot (over 2.5 billion kelvin) stars through the silicon burning process. It is the heaviest stable element to be produced in this manner. The process starts with the second largest stable nucleus created by silicon burning, which is calcium. One stable nucleus of calcium fuses with one helium nucleus, creating unstable titanium. Before the titanium decays, it can fuse with another helium nucleus, creating unstable chromium. Before the chromium decays, it can fuse with another helium nucleus, creating unstable iron. Before the iron decays, it can fuse with another helium nucleus, creating unstable nickel-56. Any further fusion of nickel-56 consumes energy instead of producing energy, so after the production of nickel-56, the star does not produce the energy necessary to keep the core from collapsing. Eventually, the nickel-56 decays to unstable cobalt-56, which in turn decays to stable iron-56. When the core of the star collapses, it creates a supernova. Supernovas also create additional forms of stable iron via the r-process.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also category: Iron minerals</div>\n<h4>Planetary occurrence</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nIron meteorites of similar composition of Earth's inner and outer core</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Iron is the sixth most abundant element in the Universe, and the most common refractory element. It is formed as the final exothermic stage of stellar nucleosynthesis, by silicon fusion in massive stars.</p>\n<p>Metallic or native iron is rarely found on the surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are pervasive and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite and magnetite. Large deposits of iron are found in banded iron formations. These geological formations are a type of rock consisting of repeated thin layers of iron oxides, either magnetite (FeO) or hematite (FeO), alternating with bands of iron-poor shale and chert. The banded iron formations were laid down in the time between 3,700 million years ago and 1,800 million years ago</p>\n<p>About 1 in 20 meteorites consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals taenite (35–80% iron) and kamacite (90–95% iron). Although rare, iron meteorites are the main form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface. It was proven by Mössbauer spectroscopy that the red color of the surface of Mars is derived from an iron oxide-rich regolith.</p>\n<h4>Stocks in use in society</h4>\n<p>According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of iron in use in society is 2200&nbsp;kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (7000–14000&nbsp;kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (2000&nbsp;kg per capita).</p>\n<h2>Chemistry and compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Iron compounds</div>\n\n<p>Iron forms compounds mainly in the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Traditionally, iron(II) compounds are called ferrous, and iron(III) compounds ferric. Iron also occurs in higher oxidation states, an example being the purple potassium ferrate (KFeO) which contains iron in its +6 oxidation state. Iron(IV) is a common intermediate in many biochemical oxidation reactions. Numerous organometallic compounds contain formal oxidation states of +1, 0, −1, or even −2. The oxidation states and other bonding properties are often assessed using the technique of Mössbauer spectroscopy. There are also many mixed valence compounds that contain both iron(II) and iron(III) centers, such as magnetite and Prussian blue (Fe(Fe[CN])). The latter is used as the traditional \"blue\" in blueprints.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHydrated iron(III) chloride, also known as ferric chloride</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The iron compounds produced on the largest scale in industry are iron(II) sulfate (FeSO·7HO) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl). The former is one of the most readily available sources of iron(II), but is less stable to aerial oxidation than Mohr's salt ((NH)Fe(SO)·6HO). Iron(II) compounds tend to be oxidized to iron(III) compounds in the air.</p>\n<p>Unlike many other metals, iron does not form amalgams with mercury. As a result, mercury is traded in standardized 76 pound flasks (34&nbsp;kg) made of iron.</p>\n<h3>Binary compounds</h3>\n<p>Iron reacts with oxygen in the air to form various oxide and hydroxide compounds; the most common are iron(II,III) oxide (FeO), and iron(III) oxide (FeO). Iron(II) oxide also exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron (see bloomery and blast furnace). They are also used in the production of ferrites, useful magnetic storage media in computers, and pigments. The best known sulfide is iron pyrite (FeS), also known as fool's gold owing to its golden luster.</p>\n<p>The binary ferrous and ferric halides are well known, with the exception of ferric iodide. The ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding binary halogen acid to give the corresponding hydrated salts.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Fe + 2 HX → FeX + H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Iron reacts with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to give the corresponding ferric halides, ferric chloride being the most common:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Fe + 3 X → 2 FeX (X = F, Cl, Br)</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Coordination and organometallic compounds</h3>\n<div>See also: organoiron chemistry</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPrussian blue</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Several cyanide complexes are known. The most famous example is Prussian blue, (Fe(Fe[CN])). Potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide are also known; the formation of Prussian blue upon reaction with iron(II) and iron(III) respectively forms the basis of a \"wet\" chemical test. Prussian blue is also used as an antidote for thallium and radioactive caesium poisoning. Prussian blue can be used in laundry bluing to correct the yellowish tint left by ferrous salts in water.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFerrocene</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Several carbonyl compounds of iron are known. The premier iron(0) compound is iron pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO), which is used to produce carbonyl iron powder, a highly reactive form of metallic iron. Thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives the trinuclear cluster, triiron dodecacarbonyl. Collman's reagent, disodium tetracarbonylferrate, is a useful reagent for organic chemistry; it contains iron in the −2 oxidation state. Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer contains iron in the rare +1 oxidation state.</p>\n<p>Ferrocene is an extremely stable complex. The first sandwich compound, it contains an iron(II) center with two cyclopentadienyl ligands bonded through all ten carbon atoms. This arrangement was a shocking novelty when it was first discovered, but the discovery of ferrocene has led to a new branch of organometallic chemistry. Ferrocene itself can be used as the backbone of a ligand, e.g. dppf. Ferrocene can itself be oxidized to the ferrocenium cation (Fc); the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple is often used as a reference in electrochemistry.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>Main article: History of ferrous metallurgy</div>\n<h3>Wrought iron</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe symbol for Mars has been used since antiquity to represent iron.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Delhi iron pillar is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600&nbsp;years.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Iron objects of great age are much rarer than objects made of gold or silver due to the ease of corrosion of iron. Beads made of meteoric iron in 3500&nbsp;BC or earlier were found in Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust has very little to no nickel content. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools or whole specimens placed in churches. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 2500 to 3000&nbsp;BC. Iron had a distinct advantage over bronze in warfare implements. It was much harder and more durable than bronze, although susceptible to rust. However, this is contested. Hittitologist Trevor Bryce argues that before advanced iron-working techniques were developed in India, meteoritic iron weapons used by early Mesopotamian armies had a tendency to shatter in combat, due to their high carbon content.</p>\n<p>The first iron production started in the Middle Bronze Age but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron from Asmar, Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 2700 and 3000&nbsp;BC. The Hittites appear to be the first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society. They began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200&nbsp;BC and the practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in 1180&nbsp;BC. The subsequent period is called the Iron Age. Iron smelting, and thus the Iron Age, reached Europe two hundred years later and arrived in Zimbabwe, Africa by the 8th century. In China, iron only appears circa 700–500 BC. Iron smelting may have been introduced into China through Central Asia. The earliest evidence of the use of a blast furnace in China dates to the 1st century AD, and cupola furnaces were used as early as early as the Warring States period (403–221 BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties.</p>\n<p>Artifacts from smelted iron occur in India from 1800 to 1200 BC, and in the Levant from about 1500 BC (suggesting smelting in Anatolia or the Caucasus).</p>\n<p>The Book of Genesis, fourth chapter, verse 22 contains the first mention of iron in the Old Testament of the Bible; \"Tubal-cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron.\" Other verses allude to iron mining (Job 28:2), iron used as a stylus (Job 19:24), furnace (Deuteronomy 4:20), chariots (Joshua 17:16), nails (I Chron. 22:3), saws and axes (II Sam. 12:31), and cooking utensils (Ezekiel 4:3). The metal is also mentioned in the New Testament, for example in Acts chapter 12 verse 10, \"[Peter passed through] the iron gate that leadeth unto the city\" of Antioch.</p>\n<p>Iron working was introduced to Greece in the late 11th century BC. The spread of ironworking in Central and Western Europe is associated with Celtic expansion. According to Pliny the Elder, iron use was common in the Roman era. The annual iron output of the Roman Empire is estimated at 84,750 t, while the similarly populous Han China produced around 5,000 t.</p>\n<p>During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Henry Cort began refining iron from pig iron to wrought iron (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1783 he patented the puddling process for refining iron ore. It was later improved by others including Joseph Hall.</p>\n<h3>Cast iron</h3>\n<p>Cast iron was first produced in China during 5th century BC, but was hardly in Europe until the medieval period. The earliest cast iron artifacts were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern Luhe County, Jiangsu in China. Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare, agriculture, and architecture. During the medieval period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context known as pig iron) using finery forges. For all these processes, charcoal was required as fuel.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<i>Coalbrookdale by Night</i>, 1801. Blast furnaces light the iron making town of Coalbrookdale.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Medieval blast furnaces were about 10 feet (3.0&nbsp;m) tall and made of fireproof brick; forced air was usually provided by hand-operated bellows. Modern blast furnaces have grown much bigger.</p>\n<p>In 1709, Abraham Darby I established a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron wasn't implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron and steel until the 18th century.</p>\n<p>Since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative first iron bridge in 1778.</p>\n<h3>Steel</h3>\n<div>See also: Steelmaking</div>\n<p>Steel (with smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron) was first produced in antiquity by using a bloomery. Blacksmiths in Luristan in western Iran were making good steel by 1000&nbsp;BC. Then improved versions, Wootz steel by India and Damascus steel by China were developed around 300 BC and 500 AD respectively. These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.</p>\n<p>New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century AD. In the Industrial Revolution, new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced.</p>\n<h3>Foundations of modern chemistry</h3>\n<p>Antoine Lavoisier used the reaction of water steam with metallic iron inside an incandescent iron tube to produce hydrogen in his experiments leading to the demonstration of the mass conservation. Anaerobic oxidation of iron at high temperature can be schematically represented by the following reactions:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Fe + HO → FeO + H</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Fe + 3 HO → FeO + 3 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 Fe + 4 HO → FeO + 4 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Industrial production</h2>\n<div>See also: Iron ore</div>\n<p>The production of iron or steel is a process containing two main stages, unless the desired product is cast iron. The first stage is to produce pig iron in a blast furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. The second is to make wrought iron or steel from pig iron by a further process.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe fining process of smelting iron ore to make wrought iron from pig iron, with the right illustration displaying men working a blast furnace, from the <i>Tiangong Kaiwu</i> encyclopedia, published in 1637 by Song Yingxing.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHow iron was extracted in the 19th century</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>For a few limited purposes like electromagnet cores, pure iron is produced by electrolysis of a ferrous sulfate solution</p>\n<h3>Blast furnace</h3>\n<div>Main article: Blast furnace</div>\n<p>Ninety percent of all mining of metallic ores is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron production involves iron ores, principally hematite (nominally FeO) and magnetite (FeO) in a carbothermic reaction (reduction with carbon) in a blast furnace at temperatures of about 2000&nbsp;°C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of coke, and a <i>flux</i> such as limestone (which is used to remove silicon dioxide impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a massive blast of heated air, about 4 tons per ton of iron, is forced into the furnace at the bottom.</p>\n<p>In the furnace, the coke reacts with oxygen in the air blast to produce carbon monoxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 C + O → 2 CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the chemical equation below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming carbon dioxide in the process:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>FeO + 3 CO → 2 Fe + 3 CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Some iron in the high-temperature lower region of the furnace reacts directly with the coke:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 FeO + 3 C → 4 Fe + 3 CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally silicon dioxide sand and other silicates. Common fluxes include limestone (principally calcium carbonate) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to calcium oxide (also known as quicklime):</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>CaCO → CaO + CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a liquid slag.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>CaO + SiO → CaSiO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron, once cooled, is called pig iron, while the slag can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for agriculture</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThis heap of iron ore pellets will be used in steel production.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Direct iron reduction</h3>\n<p>Since coke is becoming more regulated due to environmental concerns, alternative methods of processing iron have been developed. \"Direct iron reduction\" reduces iron ore to a powder called \"sponge\" iron or \"direct\" iron that is suitable for steelmaking. There are two main reactions that go on in the direct reduction process:</p>\n<p>Natural gas is partially oxidized (with heat and a catalyst):</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 CH + O → 2 CO + 4 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These gases are then treated with iron ore in a furnace, producing solid sponge iron:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>FeO + CO + 2 H → 2 Fe + CO + 2 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Silica is removed by adding a limestone flux, later.</p>\n<h3>Further processes</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Steelmaking and Ironworks</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nIron-carbon phase diagram, various stable solid solution forms</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4–5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron, also known as cast iron, is used to cast articles in foundries such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.</p>\n<p>Alternatively pig iron may be made into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.</p>\n<p>The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content: the higher the percentage of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the malleability. The properties of the steel can also be changed by several methods.</p>\n<p>Annealing involves the heating of a piece of steel to 700–800 °C for several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more workable.</p>\n<p>Steel may be hardened by cold working. The metal is bent or hammered into its final shape at a relatively cool temperature. Cold forging is the stamping of a piece of steel into shape by a heavy press. Wrenches are commonly made by cold forging. Cold rolling, which involves making a thinner but harder sheet, and cold drawing, which makes a thinner but stronger wire, are two other methods of cold working. To harden the steel, it is heated to red-hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. If it is too hardened, it is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.</p>\n<p>Heat treatment is another way to harden steel. The steel is heated red-hot, then cooled quickly. The iron carbide molecules are decomposed by the heat, but do not have time to reform. Since the free carbon atoms are stuck, it makes the steel much harder and stronger than before.</p>\n<p>Sometimes both toughness and hardness are desired. A process called case hardening may be used. Steel is heated to about 900 °C then plunged into oil or water. Carbon from the oil can diffuse into the steel, making the surface very hard. The surface cools quickly, but the inside cools slowly, making an extremely hard surface and a durable, resistant inner layer.</p>\n<p>Iron may be passivated by dipping it into a concentrated nitric acid solution. This forms a protective layer of oxide on the metal, protecting it from further corrosion.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Metallurgical</h3>\n\n<p>Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools, automobiles, the hulls of large ships, and structural components for buildings. Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel.</p>\n<p>Commercially available iron is classified based on purity and the abundance of additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. It has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470&nbsp;K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.</p>\n<p>\"White\" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of cementite, or iron-carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron-carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation.</p>\n<p>In gray iron the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of graphite, and also renders the material brittle due to the sharp edged flakes of graphite that produce stress concentration sites within the material. A newer variant of gray iron, referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.</p>\n<p>Wrought iron contains less than 0.25% carbon but large amounts of slag that give it a fibrous characteristic. It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of slag entrapped within the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by mild steel for traditional \"wrought iron\" products and blacksmithing.</p>\n<p>Mild steel corrodes more readily than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel contains 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPhoton mass attenuation coefficient for iron.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Apart from traditional applications, iron is also used for protection from ionizing radiation. Although it is lighter than another traditional protection material, lead, it is much stronger mechanically. The attenuation of radiation as a function of energy is shown in the graph.</p>\n<p>The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way. Painting, galvanization, passivation, plastic coating and bluing are all used to protect iron from rust by excluding water and oxygen or by cathodic protection.</p>\n<h3>Iron compounds</h3>\n<p>Although its metallurgical role is dominant in terms of amounts, iron compounds are pervasive in industry as well being used in many niche uses. Iron catalysts are traditionally used in the Haber-Bosch Process for the production of ammonia and the Fischer-Tropsch process for conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants. Powdered iron in an acidic solvent was used in the Bechamp reduction the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline.</p>\n<p>Iron(III) chloride finds use in water purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in paints, as an additive in animal feed, and as an etchant for copper in the manufacture of printed circuit boards. It can also be dissolved in alcohol to form tincture of iron. The other halides tend to be limited to laboratory uses.</p>\n<p>Iron(II) sulfate is used as a precursor to other iron compounds. It is also used to reduce chromate in cement. It is used to fortify foods and treat iron deficiency anemia. These are its main uses. Iron(III) sulfate is used in settling minute sewage particles in tank water. Iron(II) chloride is used as a reducing flocculating agent, in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides, and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Iron is abundant in biology. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms, ranging from the evolutionarily primitive archaea to humans. The color of blood is due to the hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, e.g. in hemes. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. Influential theories of evolution have invoked a role for iron sulfides in the iron-sulfur world theory.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of Heme b, in the protein additional ligand(s) would be attached to Fe.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Iron is a necessary trace element found in nearly all living organisms. Iron-containing enzymes and proteins, often containing heme prosthetic groups, participate in many biological oxidations and in transport. Examples of proteins found in higher organisms include hemoglobin, cytochrome (see high-valent iron), and catalase.</p>\n<h3>Bioinorganic compounds</h3>\n<p>The most commonly known and studied \"bioinorganic\" compounds of iron (i.e., iron compounds used in biology) are the heme proteins: examples are hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome P450. These compounds can transport gases, build enzymes, and be used in transferring electrons. Metalloproteins are a group of proteins with metal ion cofactors. Some examples of iron metalloproteins are ferritin and rubredoxin. Many enzymes vital to life contain iron, such as catalase, lipoxygenases, and IRE-BP.</p>\n<h3>Health and diet</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Iron deficiency (medicine) and Human iron metabolism</div>\n<p>Iron is pervasive, but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include red meat, lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, blackstrap molasses, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in molasses, teff and farina. Iron in meat (heme iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables. Although some studies suggest that heme/hemoglobin from red meat has effects which may increase the likelihood of colorectal cancer, there is still some controversy, and even a few studies suggesting that there is not enough evidence to support such claims.</p>\n<p>Iron provided by dietary supplements is often found as iron(II) fumarate, although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one third to two thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids and is also available for use as a common iron supplement. Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to \"iron glycinate\" supplements. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron (heme-based iron has higher bioavailability). Infants may require iron supplements if they are bottle-fed cow's milk. Blood donors and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake.</p>\n<h3>Uptake and storage</h3>\n<p>Iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms, because ferric iron is poorly soluble near neutral pH. Thus, bacteria have evolved high-affinity sequestering agents called siderophores.</p>\n<p>After uptake, in cells, iron storage is carefully regulated; \"free\" iron ions do not exist as such. A major component of this regulation is the protein transferrin, which binds iron ions absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells. In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the heme complex. Heme is an essential component of cytochrome proteins, which mediate redox reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, and leghemoglobin.</p>\n<p>Inorganic iron contributes to redox reactions in the iron-sulfur clusters of many enzymes, such as nitrogenase (involved in the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen) and hydrogenase. Non-heme iron proteins include the enzymes methane monooxygenase (oxidizes methane to methanol), ribonucleotide reductase (reduces ribose to deoxyribose; DNA biosynthesis), hemerythrins (oxygen transport and fixation in marine invertebrates) and purple acid phosphatase (hydrolysis of phosphate esters).</p>\n<p>Iron distribution is heavily regulated in mammals, partly because iron ions have a high potential for biological toxicity.</p>\n<h3>Regulation of uptake</h3>\n<div>Main article: Hepcidin</div>\n<p>Iron uptake is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders, such as hemochromatosis. Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians.</p>\n<p>MRI finds that iron accumulates in the hippocampus of the brains of those with Alzheimer's disease and in the substantia nigra of those with Parkinson disease.</p>\n<h3>Permeable reactive barriers</h3>\n<p>Zero-valent iron is the main reactive material for permeable reactive barriers.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Iron poisoning</div>\n<p>Large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood. High blood levels of free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce free radicals, which are highly reactive and can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, which can cause significant adverse effects, including coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity above 20&nbsp;milligrams of iron for every kilogram of mass, and 60&nbsp;milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45&nbsp;mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40&nbsp;mg/day.</p>\n<p>The medical management of iron toxicity is complicated, and can include use of a specific chelating agent called deferoxamine to bind and expel excess iron from the body.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>El Mutún in Bolivia, where 20% of the world's accessible iron is located.</li>\n<li>Iron fertilization – proposed fertilization of oceans to stimulate phytoplankton growth.</li>\n<li>Iron (metaphor)</li>\n<li>Iron in folklore</li>\n<li>List of countries by iron production</li>\n<li>Pelletising – process of creation of iron ore pellets.</li>\n<li>Rustproof iron</li>\n<li>Steel</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Demazeau, G.; Buffat, B.; Pouchard, M.; Hagenmuller, P.

  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Cobalt (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Cobalt</b> is a chemical element with symbol <b>Co</b> and atomic number 27. It is found naturally only in chemically combined form. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal.</p>\n<p>Cobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists to be due to the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name <i>kobold ore</i> (German for <i>goblin ore</i>) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were named because they were poor in known metals and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the <i>kobold</i>.</p>\n<p>Today, some cobalt is produced specifically from various metallic-lustered ores, for example cobaltite (CoAsS), but the main source of the element is as a by-product of copper and nickel mining. The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia yields most of the cobalt metal mined worldwide.</p>\n<p>Cobalt is used in the preparation of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. Cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAlO, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, smalt, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and in the production of gamma rays.</p>\n<p>Cobalt is the active center of coenzymes called cobalamins, the most common example of which is vitamin B. As such it is an essential trace dietary mineral for all animals. Cobalt in inorganic form is also an active nutrient for bacteria, algae and fungi.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA block of electrolytically refined cobalt (99.9% purity) cut from a large plate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Cobalt is a ferromagnetic metal with a specific gravity of 8.9. Pure cobalt is not found in nature, but compounds of cobalt are common. Small amounts of it are found in most rocks, soil, plants, and animals. The Curie temperature is 1115&nbsp;°C and the magnetic moment is 1.6–1.7 Bohr magnetons per atom. In nature, it is frequently associated with nickel, and both are characteristic minor components of meteoric iron. Cobalt has a relative permeability two thirds that of iron. Metallic cobalt occurs as two crystallographic structures: hcp and fcc. The ideal transition temperature between the hcp and fcc structures is 450&nbsp;°C, but in practice, the energy difference is so small that random intergrowth of the two is common.</p>\n<p>Cobalt is a weakly reducing metal that is protected from oxidation by a passivating oxide film. It is attacked by halogens and sulfur. Heating in oxygen produces CoO which loses oxygen at 900 °C to give the monoxide CoO. The metal reacts with F at 520&nbsp;K to give CoF, with Cl, Br and I, the corresponding binary halides were formed. It has no reaction with H and N even when heated, but it does react with boron, carbon, phosphorus, arsenic and sulphur. At ordinary temperatures, it reacts slowly with mineral acids, and very slowly with moist, but not dry, air.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Cobalt compounds</div>\n<p>Common oxidation states of cobalt include +2 and +3, although compounds with oxidation states ranging from −3 to +4 are also known. A common oxidation state for simple compounds is +2. Cobalt(II) salts form the red-pink [Co(HO)] complex in aqueous solution. Addition of chloride gives the intensely blue [CoCl\n4]2−.</p>\n<h3>Oxygen and chalcogen compounds</h3>\n<p>Several oxides of cobalt are known. Green cobalt(II) oxide (CoO) has rocksalt structure. It is readily oxidized with water and oxygen to brown cobalt(III) hydroxide (Co(OH)). At temperatures of 600–700&nbsp;°C, CoO oxidizes to the blue cobalt(II,III) oxide (CoO), which has a spinel structure. Black cobalt(III) oxide (CoO) is also known. Cobalt oxides are antiferromagnetic at low temperature: CoO (Neel temperature 291&nbsp;K) and CoO (Neel temperature: 40&nbsp;K), which is analogous to magnetite (FeO), with a mixture of +2 and +3 oxidation states.</p>\n<p>The principal chalcogenides of cobalt include the black cobalt(II) sulfides, CoS, which adopts a pyrite-like structure, and CoS. Pentlandite (CoS) is metal-rich.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Four dihalides of cobalt(II) are known: cobalt(II) fluoride (CoF, pink), cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl, blue), cobalt(II) bromide (CoBr, green), cobalt(II) iodide (CoI, blue-black). These halides exist in anhydrous and hydrated forms. Whereas the anhydrous dichloride is blue, the hydrate is red.</p>\n<p>The reduction potential for the reaction</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Co3+ + e<small></small> → Co2+</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>is +1.92 V, beyond that for chlorine to chloride, +1.36 V. As a consequence cobalt(III) and chloride would result in the cobalt(III) being reduced to cobalt(II). Because the reduction potential for fluorine to fluoride is so high, +2.87 V, cobalt(III) fluoride is one of the few simple stable cobalt(III) compounds. Cobalt(III) fluoride, which is used in some fluorination reactions, reacts vigorously with water.</p>\n<h3>Coordination compounds</h3>\n<p>As for all metals, molecular compounds of cobalt are classified as coordination complexes, that is molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to several ligands. The principles of electronegativity and hardness–softness of a series of ligands can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of the cobalt. For example Co complexes tend to have ammine ligands. As phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine ligands tend to feature the softer Co and Co, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(CH))CoCl). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co and Co derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (CsCoF) and potassium percobaltate (KCoO).</p>\n<p>Alfred Werner, a Nobel-prize winning pioneer in coordination chemistry, worked with compounds of empirical formula CoCl(NH). One of the isomers determined was cobalt(III) hexammine chloride. This coordination complex, a \"typical\" Werner-type complex, consists of a central cobalt atom coordinated by six ammine ligands orthogonal to each other and three chloride counteranions. Using chelating ethylenediamine ligands in place of ammonia gives tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) chloride ([Co(en)]Cl), which was one of the first coordination complexes that was resolved into optical isomers. The complex exists as both either right- or left-handed forms of a \"three-bladed propeller\". This complex was first isolated by Werner as yellow-gold needle-like crystals.</p>\n<h3>Organometallic compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organocobalt chemistry</div>\n<p>Cobaltocene is a structural analog to ferrocene, where cobalt substitutes for iron. Cobaltocene is sensitive to oxidation, much more than ferrocene. Cobalt carbonyl (Co(CO)) is a catalyst in carbonylation reactions. Vitamin B (see below) is an organometallic compound found in nature and is the only vitamin to contain a metal atom.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of cobalt</div>\n<p>Co is the only stable cobalt isotope and the only isotope to exist in nature. 22 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being Co with a half-life of 5.2714&nbsp;years, Co with a half-life of 271.79&nbsp;days, Co with a half-life of 77.27&nbsp;days, and Co with a half-life of 70.86&nbsp;days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 18&nbsp;hours, and the majority of these are shorter than 1&nbsp;second. This element also has 4 meta states, all of which have half-lives shorter than 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>The isotopes of cobalt range in atomic weight from 50 u (Co) to 73 u (Co). The primary decay mode for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope, Co, is electron capture and the primary mode of decay for those of greater than 59 atomic mass units is beta decay. The primary decay products before Co are element 26 (iron) isotopes and the primary products after are element 28 (nickel) isotopes.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEarly Chinese blue and white porcelain, manufactured circa 1335</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Cobalt compounds have been used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to glass, glazes and ceramics. Cobalt has been detected in Egyptian sculpture and Persian jewelry from the third millennium BC, in the ruins of Pompeii (destroyed in 79 AD), and in China dating from the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) and the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD).</p>\n<p>Cobalt has been used to color glass since the Bronze Age. The excavation of the Uluburun shipwreck yielded an ingot of blue glass, which was cast during the 14th century BC. Blue glass items from Egypt are colored with copper, iron, or cobalt. The oldest cobalt-colored glass was from the time of the Eighteenth dynasty in Egypt (1550–1292 BC). The location where the cobalt compounds were obtained is unknown.</p>\n<p>The word <i>cobalt</i> is derived from the German <i>kobalt</i>, from <i>kobold</i> meaning \"goblin\", a superstitious term used for the ore of cobalt by miners. The first attempts at smelting these ores to produce metals such as copper or nickel failed, yielding simply powder (cobalt(II) oxide) instead. Also, because the primary ores of cobalt always contain arsenic, smelting the ore oxidized the arsenic content into the highly toxic and volatile arsenic oxide, which also decreased the reputation of the ore for the miners.</p>\n<p>Swedish chemist Georg Brandt (1694–1768) is credited with discovering cobalt circa 1735, showing it to be a new previously unknown element different from bismuth and other traditional metals, and calling it a new \"semi-metal.\" He was able to show that compounds of cobalt metal were the source of the blue color in glass, which previously had been attributed to the bismuth found with cobalt. Cobalt became the first metal to be discovered since the pre-historical period, during which all the known metals (iron, copper, silver, gold, zinc, mercury, tin, lead and bismuth) had no recorded discoverers.</p>\n<p>During the 19th century, a significant part of the world's production of cobalt blue (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and smalt (cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket. The first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th to 18th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and Hungary. With the discovery of cobalt ore in New Caledonia in 1864 the mining of cobalt in Europe declined. With the discovery of ore deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the Katanga Province in the Congo in 1914 the mining operations shifted again. With the Shaba conflict starting in 1978, the main source for cobalt, the copper mines of Katanga Province, nearly stopped their production. The impact on the world cobalt economy from this conflict was however smaller than expected. Cobalt being a rare and the pigment being highly toxic, the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials and in some cases was able to change to cobalt-free alternatives.</p>\n<p>In 1938, John Livingood and Glenn T. Seaborg discovered cobalt-60. This isotope was famously used at Columbia University in the 1950s to establish parity violation in radioactive beta decay.</p>\n<p>After World War II, the US wanted to be sure it was never short of the ore needed for cobalt like the Germans were and went exploring for a supply within the US border. A good supply of the ore needed was found in Idaho near Blackbird canyon in the side of a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company got production started at the site.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<p>The stable form of cobalt is created in supernovas via the r-process. It comprises 0.0029% of the Earth's crust and is one of the first transition metal series.</p>\n<p>Cobalt occurs in copper and nickel minerals and in combination with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic cobaltite (CoAsS), safflorite (CoAs) and skutterudite (CoAs) minerals. The mineral cattierite is similar to pyrite and occurs together with vaesite in the copper deposits of the Katanga Province. Upon contact with the atmosphere, weathering occurs and the sulfide minerals oxidize to form pink erythrite (\"cobalt glance\": Co(AsO)·8HO) and spherocobaltite (CoCO).</p>\n<p>Cobalt is not found as a native metal, but it is mainly obtained as a by-product of nickel and copper mining activities. The main ores of cobalt are cobaltite, erythrite, glaucodot and skutterudite.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCobalt ore</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCobalt output in 2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld production trend</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Cobalt extraction techniques</div>\n<p>In 2005, the copper deposits in the Katanga Province (former Shaba province) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo were the top producer of cobalt with almost 40% world share, reports the British Geological Survey. The political situation in the Congo influences the price of cobalt significantly.</p>\n<p>The Mukondo Mountain project, operated by the Central African Mining and Exploration Company in Katanga, may be the richest cobalt reserve in the world. It is estimated to be able to produce about one third of total global production of cobalt in 2008. In July 2009 CAMEC announced a long term agreement under which CAMEC would deliver its entire annual production of cobalt in concentrate from Mukondo Mountain to Zhejiang Galico Cobalt &amp; Nickel Materials of China.</p>\n<p>Several methods exist for the separation of cobalt from copper and nickel. They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. One separation step involves froth flotation, in which surfactants bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent roasting converts the ores to the cobalt sulfate, whereas the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. The leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the arsenates. The residues are further leached with sulfuric acid yielding a solution of copper sulfate. Cobalt can also be leached from the slag of the copper smelter.</p>\n<p>The products of the above-mentioned processes are transformed into the cobalt oxide (CoO). This oxide is reduced to the metal by the aluminothermic reaction or reduction with carbon in a blast furnace.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>The main application of cobalt is as the metal in alloys.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>Cobalt-based superalloys consume most of the produced cobalt. The temperature stability of these alloys makes them suitable for use in turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in this regard. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant. This makes them useful in the medical field, where cobalt is often used (along with titanium) for orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of the wear-resistant cobalt alloys started in the first decade of the 19th century with the stellite alloys, which are cobalt-chromium alloys with varying tungsten and carbon content. The formation of chromium and tungsten carbides makes them very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts such as hip and knee replacements. Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics, where they are useful to avoid allergies to nickel. Some high speed steel drill bits also use cobalt to increase heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry purposes, yielding an alloy that is suitable for fine detailed casting and is also slightly magnetic.</p>\n<h3>Batteries</h3>\n<p>Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO) is widely used in lithium ion battery cathodes. The material is composed of cobalt oxide layers in which the lithium is intercalated. During discharging the lithium intercalated between the layers is set free as lithium ion. Nickel-cadmium (NiCd) and nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries also contain significant amounts of cobalt; the cobalt improves the oxidation capabilities of nickel in the battery.</p>\n<h3>Catalysis</h3>\n<p>Several cobalt compounds are used in chemical reactions as oxidation catalysts. Cobalt acetate is used for the conversion of xylene to terephthalic acid, the precursor to the bulk polymer polyethylene terephthalate. Typical catalysts are the cobalt carboxylates (known as cobalt soaps). They are also used in paints, varnishes, and inks as \"drying agents\" through the oxidation of drying oils. The same carboxylates are used to improve the adhesion of the steel to rubber in steel-belted radial tires.</p>\n<p>Cobalt-based catalysts are also important in reactions involving carbon monoxide. Steam reforming, useful in hydrogen production, uses cobalt oxide-base catalysts. Cobalt is also a catalyst in the Fischer–Tropsch process, used in the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide into liquid fuels. The hydroformylation of alkenes often rely on cobalt octacarbonyl as the catalyst, although such processes have been partially displaced by more efficient iridium- and rhodium-based catalysts, e.g. the Cativa process.</p>\n<p>The hydrodesulfurization of petroleum uses a catalyst derived from cobalt and molybdenum. This process helps to rid petroleum of sulfur impurities that interfere with the refining of liquid fuels.</p>\n<h3>Pigments and coloring</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCobalt blue glass</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCobalt-colored glass</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Before the 19th century, the predominant use of cobalt was as pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it has been involved in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue. The two varieties of cobalt blue, cobalt aluminate and cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), were used as pigments for paintings because of their superior stability.</p>\n<h3>Radioisotopes</h3>\n<p>Cobalt-60 (Co-60 or Co) is useful as a gamma ray source because it can be produced in predictable quantity and high activity by bombarding cobalt with neutrons. It produces two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33&nbsp;MeV.</p>\n<p>Its uses include external beam radiotherapy, sterilization of medical supplies and medical waste, radiation treatment of foods for sterilization (cold pasteurization), industrial radiography (e.g. weld integrity radiographs), density measurements (e.g. concrete density measurements), and tank fill height switches. The metal has the unfortunate habit of producing a fine dust, causing problems with radiation protection. Cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not disposed of properly, and one of the worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, after a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.</p>\n<p>Cobalt-60 has a radioactive half-life of 5.27&nbsp;years. This decrease in activity requires periodic replacement of the sources used in radiotherapy and is one reason why cobalt machines have been largely replaced by linear accelerators in modern radiation therapy.</p>\n<p>Cobalt-57 (Co-57 or Co) is a cobalt radioisotope most often used in medical tests, as a radiolabel for vitamin B uptake, and for the Schilling test. Cobalt-57 is used as a source in Mössbauer spectroscopy and is one of several possible sources in X-ray fluorescence devices.</p>\n<p>Nuclear weapon designs could intentionally incorporate Co, some of which would be activated in a nuclear explosion to produce Co. The Co, dispersed as nuclear fallout, creates what is sometimes called a cobalt bomb.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>Other uses of cobalt are in electroplating, owing to its attractive appearance, hardness and resistance to oxidation, and as ground coats for porcelain enamels.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCobalamin</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Cobalt is essential to all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, which is the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an \"ultratrace\" element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20&nbsp;mg/kg a day is recommended for them, as they can obtain vitamin B in no other way. In the early 20th century during the development for farming of the North Island Volcanic Plateau of New Zealand, cattle suffered from what was termed \"bush sickness\". It was discovered that the volcanic soils lacked cobalt salts, which was necessary for cattle. The ailment was cured by adding small amounts of cobalt to fertilizers.</p>\n<p>In the 1930s \"coast disease\" of sheep in the Ninety Mile Desert of the Southeast of South Australia was found to be due to nutrient deficiencies of the trace elements cobalt and copper. The cobalt deficiency was overcome by the development of \"cobalt bullets\", dense pellets of cobalt oxide mixed with clay, which are orally inserted to lodge in the animal's rumen.</p>\n<p>Non-ruminant herbivores produce vitamin B from bacteria in their colons which again make the vitamin from simple cobalt salts. However the vitamin cannot be absorbed from the colon, and thus non-ruminants must ingest feces to obtain the nutrient. Animals that do not follow these methods of getting vitamin B from their own gastrointestinal bacteria or that of other animals, must obtain the vitamin pre-made in other animal products in their diet, and they cannot benefit from ingesting simple cobalt salts.</p>\n<p>The cobalamin-based proteins use corrin to hold the cobalt. Coenzyme B features a reactive C-Co bond, which participates in its reactions. In humans, B exists with two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB promotes methyl (-CH) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.</p>\n<p>Although far less common than other metalloproteins (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2 an enzyme that occurs in humans and other mammals which does not use the corrin ring of B, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that are able to metabolize nitriles.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<div>Main article: Cobalt poisoning</div>\n<p>Cobalt is an essential element for life in minute amounts. The LD value for soluble cobalt salts has been estimated to be between 150 and 500&nbsp;mg/kg. Thus, for a 100&nbsp;kg person the LD would be about 20&nbsp;grams.</p>\n<p>After nickel and chromium, cobalt is a major cause of contact dermatitis. In 1966, the addition of cobalt compounds to stabilize beer foam in Canada led to cardiomyopathy, which came to be known as <i>beer drinker's cardiomyopathy</i>.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition 1989.</li>\n<li>^     Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For coins known as \"nickels\" and other uses, see Nickel (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Nickel</b> is a chemical element with the chemical symbol <b>Ni</b> and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel shows a significant chemical activity that can be observed when nickel is powdered to maximize the exposed surface area on which reactions can occur, but larger pieces of the metal are slow to react with air at ambient conditions due to the formation of a protective oxide surface. Even then, nickel is reactive enough with oxygen so that native nickel is rarely found on Earth's surface, being mostly confined to the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were protected from oxidation during their time in space. On Earth, such native nickel is always found in combination with iron, a reflection of those elements' origin as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's inner core.</p>\n<p>The use of nickel (as a natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BC. Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook its ore for a copper mineral. The element name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner's mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), that personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper. An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite, which often contains 1-2% nickel. Nickel's other important ore minerals include garnierite, and pentlandite. Major production sites include Sudbury region in Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific and Norilsk in Russia.</p>\n<p>Because of nickel's slow rate of oxidation at room temperature, it is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically this has led to its use for plating metals such as iron and brass, to its use for chemical apparatus, and its use in certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 6% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant pure-nickel plating. Nickel was once a common component of coins, but has largely been replaced by cheaper iron for this purpose, especially since the metal is a skin allergen for some people.</p>\n<p>Nickel is one of four elements that are ferromagnetic around room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is chiefly valuable in the modern world for the alloys it forms; about 60% of world production is used in nickel-steels (particularly stainless steel). Other common alloys, as well as some new superalloys, make up most of the remainder of world nickel use, with chemical uses for nickel compounds consuming less than 3% of production. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation. Enzymes of some microorganisms and plants contain nickel as an active site, which makes the metal an essential nutrient for them.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Atomic and physical properties</h3>\n<p>Nickel is a silvery-white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish. It is one of only four elements that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is 355 °C, meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352&nbsp;nm giving an atomic radius of 0.124&nbsp;nm. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.</p>\n<h4>Electron configuration dispute</h4>\n<p>The nickel atom has two electron configurations, [Ar] 4s 3d and [Ar] 4s 3d, which are very close in energy, where the symbol [Ar] refers to the argon-like core structure. There is some disagreement as to which should be considered the lowest energy configuration. Chemistry textbooks quote the electron configuration of nickel as [Ar] 4s 3d, or equivalently as [Ar] 3d 4s. This configuration agrees with the Madelung energy ordering rule, which predicts that 4s is filled before 3d. It is supported by the experimental fact that the lowest energy state of the nickel atom is a 4s 3d energy level, specifically the 3d(F) 4s F, <i>J</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 level.</p>\n<p>However each of these two configurations in fact gives rise to a set of states at different energies. The two sets of energies overlap, and the average energy of states having configuration [Ar] 4s 3d is in fact lower than the average energy of states having configuration [Ar] 4s 3d. For this reason the research literature on atomic calculations quotes the ground state configuration of nickel as 4s 3d.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of nickel</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring nickel is composed of 5 stable isotopes; Ni, Ni, Ni, Ni and Ni with Ni being the most abundant (68.077% natural abundance). Ni is the most stable nuclide of all the existing elements, with binding energy greater than both Fe, often incorrectly cited as most stable, and Fe. 18 radioisotopes have been characterised with the most stable being Ni with a half-life of 76,000 years, Ni with a half-life of 100.1 years, and Ni with a half-life of 6.077 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 60 hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 30 seconds. This element also has one meta state.</p>\n<p>Nickel-56 is produced by the silicon burning process and later set free in large quantities during type Ia supernovae. The shape of the light curve of these supernovae at intermediate to late-times corresponds to the decay via electron capture of nickel-56 to cobalt-56 and ultimately to iron-56. Nickel-59 is a long-lived cosmogenic radionuclide with a half-life of 76,000 years. Ni has found many applications in isotope geology. Ni has been used to date the terrestrial age of meteorites and to determine abundances of extraterrestrial dust in ice and sediment. Nickel-60 is the daughter product of the extinct radionuclide Fe, which decays with a half-life of 2.6 million years. Because Fe has such a long half-life, its persistence in materials in the solar system at high enough concentrations may have generated observable variations in the isotopic composition of Ni. Therefore, the abundance of Ni present in extraterrestrial material may provide insight into the origin of the solar system and its early history. Nickel-62 has the highest binding energy per nucleon of any isotope for any element (8.7946 MeV/nucleon). Isotopes heavier than Ni cannot be formed by nuclear fusion without losing energy. Ni, discovered in 1999, is the most proton-rich heavy element isotope known. With 28 protons and 20 neutrons Ni is \"double magic\" (like Pb) and therefore unusually stable.</p>\n<p>The isotopes of nickel range in atomic weight from 48&nbsp;u (48Ni) to 78&nbsp;u (78Ni). Nickel-78's half-life was recently measured at 110 milliseconds, and is believed an important isotope in supernova nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also: Ore genesis&nbsp;and Category:Nickel minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWidmanstätten pattern showing the two forms of nickel-iron, Kamacite and Taenite, in an octahedrite meteorite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>On Earth, nickel occurs most often in combination with sulfur and iron in pentlandite, with sulfur in millerite, with arsenic in the mineral nickeline, and with arsenic and sulfur in nickel galena. Nickel is commonly found in iron meteorites as the alloys kamacite and taenite.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the nickel mined comes from two types of ore deposits. The first are laterites where the principal ore minerals are nickeliferous limonite: (Fe, Ni)O(OH) and garnierite (a hydrous nickel silicate): (Ni, Mg)SiO(OH). The second are magmatic sulfide deposits where the principal ore mineral is pentlandite: (Ni, Fe)S.</p>\n<p>Australia and New Caledonia have the biggest estimate reserves (45% all together).</p>\n<p>In terms of World Resources, identified land-based resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons of nickel (about the double of known reserves). About 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits.</p>\n<p>Based on geophysical evidence, most of the nickel on Earth is postulated to be concentrated in the Earth's outer core and inner core. Kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel. For kamacite the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90:10 to 95:5 although impurities such as cobalt or carbon may be present, while for taenite the nickel content is between 20% and 65%. Kamacite and taenite occur in nickel iron meteorites.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Nickel compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTetracarbonyl nickel</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The most common oxidation state of nickel is +2, but compounds of Ni, Ni, and Ni are well known, and Ni has been demonstrated.</p>\n<h3>Nickel(0)</h3>\n<p>Tetracarbonylnickel (Ni(CO)), discovered by Ludwig Mond, is a volatile, highly toxic liquid at room temperature. On heating, the complex decomposes back to nickel and carbon monoxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Ni(CO)  Ni + 4 CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This behavior is exploited in the Mond process for purifying nickel, as described above. The related nickel(0) complex bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) is a useful catalyst in organonickel chemistry due to the easily displaced cod ligands.</p>\n<h3>Nickel(I)</h3>\n<p>Nickel(I) compounds and complexes are rare. The dark red diamagnetic K[Ni(CN)] is a representative example of Ni(I). It is prepared by reduction of K[Ni(CN)] using sodium amalgam. This compound is unstable and liberates H gas from water.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of [Ni(CN)] ion</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Nickel(II)</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nColor of various Ni(II) complexes in aqueous solution.

Nickel(II) sulfate is produced in large quantities by dissolving nickel metal or oxides in sulfuric acid. It exists as both a hexa- and heptahydrates. This compound is useful for electroplating nickel.</p>\n<p>The four halogens form nickel compounds, all of which adopt octahedral geometries. Nickel(II) chloride is most common, and its behavior is illustrative of the other halides. Nickel(II) chloride is produced by dissolving nickel residues in hydrochloric acid. The dichloride is usually encountered as the green hexahydrate, but it can be dehydrated to give the yellow anhydrous NiCl. Some tetracoordinate nickel(II) complexes form both tetrahedral and square planar geometries. The tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic and the square planar complexes are diamagnetic. This equilibrium as well as the formation of octahedral complexes contrasts with the behavior of the divalent complexes of the heavier group 10 metals, palladium(II) and platinum(II), which tend to adopt only square-planar complexes.</p>\n<p>Nickelocene is known; it has an electron count of 20, making it relatively unstable.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNickel(III) antimonide</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Nickel(III) and (IV)</h3>\n<p>For simple compounds, nickel(III) and nickel(IV) only occurs with fluoride and oxides, with the exception of KNiIO, which can be considered as a formal salt of the [IO] ion. Ni(IV) is present in the mixed oxide BaNiO, while Ni(III) is present in nickel(III) oxide, which is used as the cathode in many rechargeable batteries, including nickel-cadmium, nickel-iron, nickel hydrogen, and nickel-metal hydride, and used by certain manufacturers in Li-ion batteries. Nickel(III) can be stabilized by σ-donor ligands such as thiols and phosphines.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Because the ores of nickel are easily mistaken for ores of silver, understanding of this metal and its use dates to relatively recent times. However, the unintentional use of nickel is ancient, and can be traced back as far as 3500 BC. Bronzes from what is now Syria had contained up to 2% nickel. Further, there are Chinese manuscripts suggesting that \"white copper\" (cupronickel, known as <i>baitong</i>) was used there between 1700 and 1400 BC. This Paktong white copper was exported to Britain as early as the 17th century, but the nickel content of this alloy was not discovered until 1822.</p>\n<p>In medieval Germany, a red mineral was found in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) that resembled copper ore. However, when miners were unable to extract any copper from it, they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to <i>Old Nick</i>), for besetting the copper. They called this ore <i>Kupfernickel</i> from the German <i>Kupfer</i> for copper. This ore is now known to be nickeline or niccolite, a nickel arsenide. In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt was trying to extract copper from kupfernickel—and instead produced a white metal that he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral, nickel. In modern German, Kupfernickel or Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy cupronickel.</p>\n<p>After its discovery, the only source for nickel was the rare Kupfernickel but, from 1824 on, the nickel was obtained as a byproduct of cobalt blue production. The first large-scale producer of nickel was Norway, which exploited nickel-rich pyrrhotite from 1848 on. The introduction of nickel in steel production in 1889 increased the demand for nickel, and the nickel deposits of New Caledonia, which were discovered in 1865, provided most of the world's supply between 1875 and 1915. The discovery of the large deposits in the Sudbury Basin, Canada in 1883, in Norilsk-Talnakh, Russia in 1920, and in the Merensky Reef, South Africa in 1924 made large-scale production of nickel possible.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDutch coins made of pure nickel</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Nickel has been a component of coins since the mid-19th century. In the United States, the term \"nickel\" or \"nick\" originally applied to the copper-nickel Flying Eagle cent, which replaced copper with 12% nickel 1857–58, then the Indian Head cent of the same alloy from 1859–1864. Still later in 1865, the term designated the three-cent nickel, with nickel increased to 25%. In 1866, the five-cent shield nickel (25% nickel, 75% copper) appropriated the designation. Along with the alloy proportion, this term has been used to the present in the United States. Coins of nearly pure nickel were first used in 1881 in Switzerland, and more notably 99.9% nickel five-cent coins were struck in Canada (the world's largest nickel producer at the time) during non-war years from 1922–1981, and their metal content made these coins magnetic. During the wartime period 1942–45, more or all nickel was removed from Canadian and U.S. coins, due to nickel's war-critical use in armor. Canada switched alloys again to plated steel during the Korean war, but was forced to stop making pure nickel \"nickels\" in 1981, reserving the pure 99.9% nickel alloy after 1968 only to its higher-value coins. Finally, in the 21st century, with rising nickel prices, most countries that formerly used nickel in their coins have abandoned the metal for cost reasons, and the U.S. five cents remains one of the few coins that still uses the metal for anything other than exterior plating.<br></p>\n<h2>World production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld nickel production in metric tons, in 2005. The Russian Federation is the largest producer, followed by Canada.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>In 2011, Russia was the largest producer of nickel with about one-fifth world share closely followed by Canada, Australia, and Indonesia and Philippines, as reported by the US Geological Survey. The largest deposits of nickel in non-Russian Europe are located in Finland and the second largest in Greece. A nickel deposit in western Turkey had been exploited, with this location being especially convenient for European smelters, steelmakers, and factories.</p>\n<p>Identified land-based resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons of nickel. About 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits. In addition, extensive deep-sea resources of nickel are in manganese crusts and nodules covering large areas of the ocean floor, particularly in the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>The one locality in the United States where nickel was commercially mined is Riddle, Oregon, where several square miles of nickel-bearing garnierite surface deposits are located. The mine closed in 1987. The Eagle mine project is a proposed new nickel mine in Michigan's upper peninsula.<br></p>\n<h2>Extraction and purification</h2>\n<p>Nickel is recovered through extractive metallurgy. Nickel is extracted from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75% purity. In many stainless steel applications, 75% pure nickel can be used without further purification, depending on the composition of the impurities.</p>\n<p>Most sulfide ores have traditionally been processed using pyrometallurgical techniques to produce a matte for further refining. Recent advances in hydrometallurgy have resulted in significant nickel purification using these processes. Most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a froth flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction. In hydrometallurgical processes, nickel sulfide ores undergo flotation (differential flotation if Ni/Fe ratio is too low) and then smelted. After producing the nickel matte, further processing is done via the Sherritt-Gordon process. First, copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide, leaving a concentrate of only cobalt and nickel. Then, solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel, with the final nickel concentration greater than 99%.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nElectrolytically refined nickel nodule, with visible green, crystallized nickel-electrolyte salts in the pores.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Electrorefining</h3>\n<p>A second common form of further refining involves the leaching of the metal matte into a nickel salt solution, followed by the electro-winning of the nickel from solution by plating it onto a cathode as electrolytic nickel.</p>\n<h3>Mond process</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHighly purified nickel spheres made by the Mond process.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Mond process</div>\n<p>Purification of nickel oxides to obtain the purest metal is performed via the Mond process, which increases the nickel concentrate to greater than 99.99% purity. This process was patented by L. Mond and has been in industrial use since before the beginning of the 20th century. In the process, nickel is reacted with carbon monoxide at around 40–80&nbsp;°C to form nickel carbonyl in the presence of a sulfur catalyst. Iron gives iron pentacarbonyl too, but this reaction is slow. If necessary, it may be separated by distillation. Dicobalt octacarbonyl is also formed in this process, but it decomposes to tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a non-volatile solid.</p>\n<p>Nickel is re-obtained from the nickel carbonyl by one of two processes. It may be passed through a large chamber at high temperatures in which tens of thousands of nickel spheres, called pellets, are constantly stirred. It then decomposes depositing pure nickel onto the nickel spheres. Alternatively, the nickel carbonyl may be decomposed in a smaller chamber at 230&nbsp;°C to create fine nickel powder. The resultant carbon monoxide is re-circulated and reused through the process. The highly pure nickel produced by this process is known as \"carbonyl nickel\".</p>\n<h3>Metal value</h3>\n<p>The market price of nickel surged throughout 2006 and the early months of 2007; as of April 5, 2007, the metal was trading at 52,300 USD/tonne or 1.47 USD/oz. The price subsequently fell dramatically from these peaks, and as of 19 January 2009 the metal was trading at 10,880 USD/tonne.</p>\n<p>The US nickel coin contains 0.04 oz (1.25 g) of nickel, which at the April 2007 price was worth 6.5 cents, along with 3.75&nbsp;grams of copper worth about 3 cents, making the metal value over 9 cents. Since the face value of a nickel is 5 cents, this made it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals at a profit. However, the United States Mint, in anticipation of this practice, implemented new interim rules on December 14, 2006, subject to public comment for 30 days, which criminalize the melting and export of cents and nickels. Violators can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for a maximum of five years.</p>\n<p>As of September 16, 2011, the melt value of a U.S. nickel is $0.0600409, which is 20% higher than the face value.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNickel superalloy jet engine (RB199) turbine blade</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The fraction of global nickel production presently used for various applications is as follows: 46% for making nickel steels; 34% in nonferrous alloys and superalloys; 14% electroplating, and 6% into other uses.</p>\n<p>Nickel is used in many specific and recognizable industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel, alnico magnets, coinage, rechargeable batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules, and special alloys. It is also used for plating and as a green tint in glass. Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in the nickel steels and nickel cast irons, of which there are many varieties. It is also widely used in many other alloys, such as nickel brasses and bronzes, and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold (Inconel, Incoloy, Monel, Nimonic).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA \"horseshoe magnet\" made of alnico nickel alloy. The composition of alnico alloys is typically 8–12% Al, 15–26% Ni, 5–24% Co, up to 6% Cu, up to 1% Ti, and the balance is Fe. The development of alnico began in 1931 when it was discovered that an alloy of iron, nickel, and aluminum had a coercivity double that of the best magnet steels of the time. Alnico magnets are now being replaced by rare earth magnets in many applications</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Because of its resistance to corrosion, nickel has been occasionally used historically as a substitute for decorative silver. Nickel was also occasionally used in some countries after 1859 as a cheap coinage metal (see above) but in the later years of the 20th century was largely replaced by cheaper stainless steel (i.e., iron) alloys, except notably in the United States.</p>\n<p>Nickel is an excellent alloying agent for certain other precious metals, and so used in the so-called fire assay, as a collector of platinum group elements (PGE). As such, nickel is capable of full collection of all 6 PGE elements from ores, in addition to partial collection of gold. High-throughput nickel mines may also engage in PGE recovery (primarily platinum and palladium); examples are Norilsk in Russia and the Sudbury Basin in Canada.</p>\n<p>Nickel foam or nickel mesh is used in gas diffusion electrodes for alkaline fuel cells.</p>\n<p>Nickel and its alloys are frequently used as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. Raney nickel, a finely divided nickel-aluminium alloy, is one common form, however related catalysts are also often used, including related 'Raney-type' catalysts.</p>\n<p>Nickel is a naturally magnetostrictive material, meaning that, in the presence of a magnetic field, the material undergoes a small change in length. In the case of nickel, this change in length is negative (contraction of the material), which is known as negative magnetostriction and is on the order of 50&nbsp;ppm.</p>\n<p>Nickel is used as a binder in the cemented tungsten carbide or hardmetal industry and used in proportions of six to 12% by weight. Nickel can make the tungsten carbide magnetic and adds corrosion-resistant properties to the cemented tungsten carbide parts, although the hardness is lower than those of parts made with cobalt binder.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Although not recognized until the 1970s, nickel plays important roles in the biology of microorganisms and plants. The plant enzyme urease (an enzyme that assists in the hydrolysis of urea) contains nickel. The NiFe-hydrogenases contain nickel in addition to iron-sulfur clusters. Such [NiFe]-hydrogenases characteristically oxidise H. A nickel-tetrapyrrole coenzyme, Cofactor F430, is present in the methyl coenzyme M reductase, which powers methanogenic archaea. One of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes consists of an Fe-Ni-S cluster. Other nickel-containing enzymes include a rare bacterial class of superoxide dismutase and glyoxalase I enzymes in bacteria and several parasitic eukaryotic trypanosomal parasites  (this enzyme in higher organisms, including yeast and mammals, uses divalent zinc, Zn).</p>\n<h2>Toxicity</h2>\n<p>In the US, the minimal risk level of nickel and its compounds is set to 0.2&nbsp;µg/m for inhalation during 15–364 days. Nickel sulfide fume and dust are believed carcinogenic, and various other nickel compounds may be as well. Nickel carbonyl, [Ni(CO)], is an extremely toxic gas. The toxicity of metal carbonyls is a function of both the toxicity of the metal as well as the carbonyl's ability to give off highly toxic carbon monoxide gas, and this one is no exception; nickel carbonyl is also explosive in air. Sensitized individuals may show an allergy to nickel, affecting their skin, also known as dermatitis. Sensitivity to nickel may also be present in patients with pompholyx. Nickel is an important cause of contact allergy, partly due to its use in jewellery intended for pierced ears. Nickel allergies affecting pierced ears are often marked by itchy, red skin. Many earrings are now made nickel-free due to this problem. The amount of nickel allowed in products that come into contact with human skin is regulated by the European Union. In 2002, researchers found amounts of nickel being emitted by 1 and 2 Euro coins far in excess of those standards. This is believed due to a galvanic reaction.</p>\n<p>Nickel was voted Allergen of the Year in 2008 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society.</p>\n<p>Reports also showed that both the nickel-induced activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) and the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes are due to depleted intracellular ascorbate levels. The addition of ascorbate to the culture medium increased the intracellular ascorbate level and reversed both the metal-induced stabilization of HIF-1- and HIF-1α-dependent gene expression.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Category:Nickel alloys</li>\n<li>Nickel aluminide</li>\n<li>Raney nickel</li>\n<li>Superalloy</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ M.

  "title": "Copper",
  "html": "<div>For other uses, see Copper (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Copper</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Cu</b> (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29. It is a ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Pure copper is soft and malleable; a freshly exposed surface has a reddish-orange color. It is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, a building material, and a constituent of various metal alloys.</p>\n<p>The metal and its alloys have been used for thousands of years. In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, hence the origin of the name of the metal as <i>сyprium</i> (metal of Cyprus), later shortened to <i>сuprum</i>. Its compounds are commonly encountered as copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to minerals such as azurite and turquoise and have been widely used historically as pigments. Architectural structures built with copper corrode to give green verdigris (or patina). Decorative art prominently features copper, both by itself and as part of pigments.</p>\n<p>Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustacea copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, which is replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. The main areas where copper is found in humans are liver, muscle and bone. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic substances, fungicides, and wood preservatives.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA copper disc (99.95% pure) made by continuous casting and etching.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCopper just above its melting point keeps its pink luster color when enough light outshines the orange incandescence color.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Copper, silver and gold are in group 11 of the periodic table, and they share certain attributes: they have one s-orbital electron on top of a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility and electrical conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements do not contribute much to the interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Contrary to metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.</p>\n<p>The softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×10&nbsp;S/m) and thus also high thermal conductivity, which are the second highest among pure metals at room temperature. This is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature mostly originates from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak for a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×10&nbsp;A/m of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively. As with other metals, if copper is placed against another metal, galvanic corrosion will occur.</p>\n<p>Together with caesium and gold (both yellow), and osmium (bluish), copper is one of only four elemental metals with a natural color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells is such that it corresponds to orange light. The same mechanism accounts for the yellow color of gold and caesium.</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUnoxidized copper wire (left) and oxidized copper wire (right).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe East Tower of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. The contrast between the refurbished copper installed in 2010 and the green color of the original 1894 copper is clearly seen.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Copper forms a rich variety of compounds with oxidation states +1 and +2, which are often called <i>cuprous</i> and <i>cupric</i>, respectively. It does not react with water, but it slowly reacts with atmospheric oxygen forming a layer of brown-black copper oxide. In contrast to the oxidation of iron by wet air, this oxide layer stops the further, bulk corrosion. A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper constructions, such as the Statue of Liberty, the largest copper statue in the world built using repoussé and chasing. Copper tarnishes when exposed to hydrogen sulfides and other sulfides, which react with it to form various copper sulfides on the surface. Oxygen-containing ammonia solutions give water-soluble complexes with copper, as do oxygen and hydrochloric acid to form copper chlorides and acidified hydrogen peroxide to form copper(II) salts. Copper(II) chloride and copper comproportionate to form copper(I) chloride.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of copper</div>\n<p>There are 29 isotopes of copper. Cu and Cu are stable, with Cu comprising approximately 69% of naturally occurring copper; they both have a spin of 3/2. The other isotopes are radioactive, with the most stable being Cu with a half-life of 61.83&nbsp;hours. Seven metastable isotopes have been characterized, with Cu the longest-lived with a half-life of 3.8 minutes. Isotopes with a mass number above 64 decay by β, whereas those with a mass number below 64 decay by β. Cu, which has a half-life of 12.7 hours, decays both ways.</p>\n<p>Cu and Cu have significant applications. Cu is a radiocontrast agent for X-ray imaging, and complexed with a chelate can be used for treating cancer. Cu is used in Cu-PTSM that is a radioactive tracer for positron emission tomography.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNative Copper from the Keweenaw Peninsula Michigan about 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) long</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Copper is synthesized in massive stars and is present in the Earth's crust at a concentration of about 50 parts per million (ppm), where it occurs as native copper or in minerals such as the copper sulfides chalcopyrite and chalcocite, copper carbonates azurite and malachite and the copper(I) oxide mineral cuprite. The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, US. Native copper is a polycrystal, with the largest described single crystal measuring 4.4×3.2×3.2&nbsp;cm.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChuquicamata in Chile is one of the world's largest open pit copper mines.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld production trend</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCopper output in 2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCopper prices 2003–2011 in USD per tonne</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: List of countries by copper production</div>\n<p>Most copper is mined or extracted as copper sulfides from large open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Examples include Chuquicamata in Chile, Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, United States and El Chino Mine in New Mexico, United States. According to the British Geological Survey, in 2005, Chile was the top mine producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the In-situ leach process. Several sites in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.</p>\n<h3>Reserves</h3>\n<div>See also: Peak copper#Reserves</div>\n<p>Copper has been in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 96% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900, and more than half was extracted in only the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast (around 10 tons just in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, or about 5 million years worth at the current rate of extraction). However, only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable, given present-day prices and technologies. Various estimates of existing copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of Peak copper, analogous to Peak Oil.</p>\n<p>The price of copper has historically been unstable, and it quintupled from the 60-year low of US$0.60/lb (US$1.32/kg) in June 1999 to US$3.75 per pound (US$8.27/kg) in May 2006. It dropped to US$2.40/lb (US$5.29/kg) in February 2007, then rebounded to US$3.50/lb (US$7.71/kg) in April 2007. In February 2009, weakening global demand and a steep fall in commodity prices since the previous year's highs left copper prices at US$1.51/lb.</p>\n<h3>Methods</h3>\n<div>Main article: Copper extraction techniques</div>\n<p>The concentration of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most commercial ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS) and to a lesser extent chalcocite (CuS). These minerals are concentrated from crushed ores to the level of 10–15% copper by froth flotation or bioleaching. Heating this material with silica in flash smelting removes much of the iron as slag. The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into its oxides, which in turn react with the silica to form the silicate slag, which floats on top of the heated mass. The resulting <i>copper matte</i> consisting of CuS is then roasted to convert all sulfides into oxides:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 CuS + 3 O → 2 CuO + 2 SO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The cuprous oxide is converted to <i>blister</i> copper upon heating:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 CuO → 4 Cu + O</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The Sudbury matte process converted only half the sulfide to oxide and then used this oxide to remove the rest of the sulfur as oxide. It was then electrolytically refined and the anode mud exploited for the platinum and gold it contained. This step exploits the relatively easy reduction of copper oxides to copper metal. Natural gas is blown across the blister to remove most of the remaining oxygen and electrorefining is performed on the resulting material to produce pure copper:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Cu + 2 e → Cu</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Recycling</h3>\n<p>Copper, like aluminium, is 100% recyclable without any loss of quality whether in a raw state or contained in a manufactured product. In volume, copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium. It is estimated that 80% of the copper ever mined is still in use today. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of Copper in use in society is 35–55&nbsp;kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (140–300&nbsp;kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (30–40&nbsp;kg per capita).</p>\n<p>The process of recycling copper follows roughly the same steps as is used to extract copper, but requires fewer steps. High purity scrap copper is melted in a furnace and then reduced and cast into billets and ingots; lower purity scrap is refined by electroplating in a bath of sulfuric acid.</p>\n<h2>Alloys</h2>\n<div>See also: List of copper alloys</div>\n<p>Numerous copper alloys exist, many with important uses. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but can refer to any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze. Copper is one of the most important constituents of carat silver and gold alloys and carat solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys.</p>\n<p>The alloy of copper and nickel, called cupronickel, is used in low-denomination coins, often for the outer cladding. The US 5-cent coin called <i>nickel</i> consists of 75% copper and 25% nickel and has a homogeneous composition. The 90% copper/10% nickel alloy is remarkable by its resistance to corrosion and is used in various parts being exposed to seawater. Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a pleasant golden color and are used in decorations. Some lead-free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA sample of copper(I) oxide.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Category:Copper compounds</div>\n<h3>Binary compounds</h3>\n<p>As for other elements, the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds, i.e. those containing only two elements. The principal ones are the oxides, sulfides and halides. Both cuprous and cupric oxides are known. Among the numerous copper sulfides, important examples include copper(I) sulfide and copper(II) sulfide.</p>\n<p>The cuprous halides with chlorine, bromine, and iodine are known, as are the cupric halides with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Attempts to prepare copper(II) iodide give cuprous iodide and iodine.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Cu + 4 I → 2 CuI + I</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Coordination chemistry</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCopper(II) gives a deep blue coloration in the presence of ammonia ligands. The one used here is tetramminecopper(II) sulfate.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Copper, like all metals, forms coordination complexes with ligands. In aqueous solution, copper(II) exists as [Cu(HO)]. This complex exhibits the fastest water exchange rate (speed of water ligands attaching and detaching) for any transition metal aquo complex. Adding aqueous sodium hydroxide causes the precipitation of light blue solid copper(II) hydroxide. A simplified equation is:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Cu + 2 OH → Cu(OH)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Aqueous ammonia results in the same precipitate. Upon adding excess ammonia, the precipitate dissolves, forming tetraamminecopper(II):</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Cu(HO)(OH) + 4 NH → [Cu(HO)(NH)] + 2 HO + 2 OH</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Many other oxyanions form complexes; these include copper(II) acetate, copper(II) nitrate, and copper(II) carbonate. Copper(II) sulfate forms a blue crystalline pentahydrate, which is the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory. It is used in a fungicide called the Bordeaux mixture.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBall-and-stick model of the complex [Cu(NH)(HO)], illustrating the octahedral coordination geometry common for copper(II).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Polyols, compounds containing more than one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.</p>\n<h3>Organocopper chemistry</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organocopper compound</div>\n<p>Compounds that contain a carbon-copper bond are known as organocopper compounds. They are very reactive towards oxygen to form copper(I) oxide and have many uses in chemistry. They are synthesized by treating copper(I) compounds with Grignard reagents, terminal alkynes or organolithium reagents; in particular, the last reaction described produces a Gilman reagent. These can undergo substitution with alkyl halides to form coupling products; as such, they are important in the field of organic synthesis. Copper(I) acetylide is highly shock-sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling and the Sonogashira coupling. Conjugate addition to enones and carbocupration of alkynes can also be achieved with organocopper compounds. Copper(I) forms a variety of weak complexes with alkenes and carbon monoxide, especially in the presence of amine ligands.</p>\n<h3>Copper(III) and copper(IV)</h3>\n<p>Copper(III) is most characteristically found in oxides. A simple example is potassium cuprate, KCuO, a blue-black solid. The best studied copper(III) compounds are the cuprate superconductors. Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBaCuO) consists of both Cu(II) and Cu(III) centres. Like oxide, fluoride is a highly basic anion and is known to stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states. Indeed, both copper(III) and even copper(IV) fluorides are known, KCuF and CsCuF, respectively.</p>\n<p>Some copper proteins form oxo complexes, which also feature copper(III). With di- and tripeptides, purple-colored copper(III) complexes are stabilized by the deprotonated amide ligands.</p>\n<p>Complexes of copper(III) are also observed as intermediates in reactions of organocopper compounds.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Copper Age</h3>\n<div>Main article: Copper Age</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA corroded copper ingot from Zakros, Crete, shaped in the form of an animal skin typical in that era.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world (including Pakistan, China, and the Americas) copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC. Previously the only tool made of copper had been the awl, used for punching holes in leather and gouging out peg-holes for wood joining. However, the introduction of a more robust form of copper led to the widespread use, and large-scale production of heavy metal tools, including axes, adzes, and axe-adzes.</p>\n<h3>Bronze Age</h3>\n<div>Main article: Bronze Age</div>\n<p>Alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting, and about 2000 years after \"natural bronze\" had come into general use. Bronze artifacts from Sumerian cities and Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC. The Bronze Age began in Southeastern Europe around 3700–3300 BC, in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age, 2000–1000 BC in the Near East, 600 BC in Northern Europe. The transition between the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the Chalcolithic period (copper-stone), with copper tools being used with stone tools. This term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the Calcholithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is of much more recent origin. It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.</p>\n<h3>Antiquity and Middle Ages</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nIn alchemy the symbol for copper was also the symbol for the goddess and planet Venus.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChalcolithic copper mine in Timna Valley, Negev Desert, Israel.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In Greece, copper was known by the name <i>chalkos</i> (χαλκός). It was an important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as <i>aes Cyprium</i>, <i>aes</i> being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and <i>Cyprium</i> from Cyprus, where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to <i>cuprum</i>, hence the English <i>copper</i>. Aphrodite and Venus represented copper in mythology and alchemy, because of its lustrous beauty, its ancient use in producing mirrors, and its association with Cyprus, which was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.</p>\n<p>Britain's first use of brass occurred around the 3rd–2nd century BC. In North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans. Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD; it proceeded at a much slower rate on other continents. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000 t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the Industrial Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe.</p>\n<p>The gates of the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze made by depletion gilding. It was most prevalent in Alexandria, where alchemy is thought to have begun. In ancient India, copper was used in the holistic medical science Ayurveda for surgical instruments and other medical equipment. Ancient Egyptians (~2400 BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later on for headaches, burns, and itching. The Baghdad Battery, with copper cylinders soldered to lead, dates back to 248 BC to AD 226 and resembles a galvanic cell, leading people to believe this was the first battery; the claim has not been verified.</p>\n<h3>Modern period</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAcid mine drainage affecting the stream running from the disused Parys Mountain copper mines</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The Great Copper Mountain was a mine in Falun, Sweden, that operated from the 10th century to 1992. It produced two thirds of Europe's copper demand in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden's wars during that time. It was referred to as the nation's treasury; Sweden had a copper backed currency.</p>\n<p>The uses of copper in art were not limited to currency: it was used by Renaissance sculptors, in photographic technology known as the daguerreotype, and the Statue of Liberty. Copper plating and copper sheathing for ships' hulls was widespread; the ships of Christopher Columbus were among the earliest to have this feature. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world’s primary copper production.</p>\n<p>The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, formed in 1967 with Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, played a similar role for copper as OPEC does for oil. It never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, was never a member; it was dissolved in 1988.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAssorted copper fittings</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The major applications of copper are in electrical wires (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%) and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is mostly used as a pure metal, but when a higher hardness is required it is combined with other elements to make an alloy (5% of total use) such as brass and bronze. A small part of copper supply is used in production of compounds for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Machining of copper is possible, although it is usually necessary to use an alloy for intricate parts to get good machinability characteristics.</p>\n<h3>Wire and cable</h3>\n<div>Main article: Copper wire and cable</div>\n<p>Despite competition from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring with the major exception being overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring is the most important market for the copper industry. This includes building wire, communications cable, power distribution cable, appliance wire, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used to manufacture electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, solderability, and ease of installation.</p>\n<h3>Electronics and related devices</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCopper electrical busbars distributing power to a large building</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Integrated circuits and printed circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity <i>(see Copper interconnect for main article)</i>; heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper as a result of its superior heat dissipation capacity to aluminium. Electromagnets, vacuum tubes, cathode ray tubes, and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper, as do wave guides for microwave radiation.</p>\n<h3>Electric motors</h3>\n<div>Main article: Copper in energy efficient motors</div>\n<p>Copper’s greater conductivity versus other metallic materials enhances the electrical energy efficiency of motors. This is important because motors and motor-driven systems account for 43%-46% of all global electricity consumption and 69% of all electricity used by industry. Increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil increases the electrical energy efficiency of the motor. Copper motor rotors, a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design objectives, are enabling general-purpose induction motors to meet and exceed National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) premium efficiency standards.</p>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<div>Main article: Copper in architecture</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCopper roof on the Minneapolis City Hall, coated with patina</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOld copper utensils in a Jerusalem restaurant</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Copper has been used since ancient times as a durable, corrosion resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for hundreds or thousands of years. Copper’s architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial indoor products, such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper’s other important benefits as an architectural material include its low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and its recyclability.</p>\n<p>The metal’s distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers. The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering. It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain. Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished' to embark a particular look, feel, and/or color. Finishes include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings.</p>\n<p>Copper has excellent brazing and soldering properties and can be welded; the best results are obtained with gas metal arc welding.</p>\n<h3>Antibiofouling applications</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Copper alloys in aquaculture and Copper sheathing</div>\n<p>Copper has long been used as a biostatic surface to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal. Bacteria will not grow on a copper surface because it is biostatic. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because of the fact that they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.</p>\n<h3>Antimicrobial applications</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Antimicrobial properties of copper and Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces</div>\n<p>Numerous antimicrobial efficacy studies have been conducted in the past 10 years regarding copper’s efficacy to destroy a wide range of bacteria, as well as influenza A virus, adenovirus, and fungi.</p>\n<p>Copper-alloy touch surfaces have natural intrinsic properties to destroy a wide range of microorganisms (e.g., <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7, methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Clostridium difficile</i>, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and fungi). Some 355 copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as “antimicrobial materials with public health benefits,\" which allows manufacturers to legally make claims as to the positive public health benefits of products made with registered antimicrobial copper alloys. In addition, the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys, such as bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, computer keyboards, health club equipment, shopping cart handles, etc. (for a comprehensive list of products, see: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products). Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease, and Legionnaires' disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems. Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U.K., Ireland, Japan, Korea, France, Denmark, and Brazil and in the subway transit system in Santiago, Chile, where copper-zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between 2011–2014.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>Copper compounds in liquid form are used as a wood preservative, particularly in treating original portion of structures during restoration of damage due to dry rot. Together with zinc, copper wires may be placed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers use copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics, as do ceramic glazes, stained glass and musical instruments. Electroplating commonly uses copper as a base for other metals such as nickel.</p>\n<p>Copper is one of three metals, along with lead and silver, used in a museum materials testing procedure called the Oddy test. In this procedure, copper is used to detect chlorides, oxides, and sulfur compounds.</p>\n<p>Copper is commonly used in jewelry, and folklore says that copper bracelets relieve arthritis symptoms. Copper is the principal alloying metal in sterling silver and gold alloys. It may also be used on its own, or as a constituent of brass, bronze, gilding metal and many other base metal alloys.</p>\n<p>Copper is used as the printing plate in etching, engraving and other forms of intaglio (printmaking) printmaking</p>\n<p>Copper oxide and carbonate is used in glassmaking and in ceramic glazes to impart green and brown colors.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>Main article: Copper in health</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRich sources of copper include oysters, beef and lamb liver, Brazil nuts, blackstrap molasses, cocoa, and black pepper. Good sources include lobster, nuts and sunflower seeds, green olives, avocados, and wheat bran.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Copper proteins have diverse roles in biological electron transport and oxygen transportation, processes that exploit the easy interconversion of Cu(I) and Cu(II).   The biological role for copper commenced with the appearance of oxygen in earth's atmosphere. The protein hemocyanin is the oxygen carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods such as the horseshoe crab (<i>Limulus polyphemus</i>). Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood, not the red blood found in organisms that rely on hemoglobin for this purpose. Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by their role in the formation of lacquers.</p>\n<p>Copper is also a component of other proteins associated with the processing of oxygen. In cytochrome c oxidase, which is required for aerobic respiration, copper and iron cooperate in the reduction of oxygen. Copper is also found in many superoxide dismutases, proteins that catalyze the decomposition of superoxides, by converting it (by disproportionation) to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 HO → HO + O</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Several copper proteins, such as the \"blue copper proteins\", do not interact directly with substrates, hence they are not enzymes. These proteins relay electrons by the process called electron transfer.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPhotosynthesis functions by an elaborate electron transport chain within the thylakoid membrane. A central \"link\" in this chain is plastocyanin, a blue copper protein.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Dietary needs</h3>\n<p>Copper is an essential trace element in plants and animals, but not some microorganisms. The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1&nbsp;mg per kg of body mass. Stated differently, the RDA for copper in normal healthy adults is quoted as 0.97&nbsp;mg/day and as 3.0&nbsp;mg/day. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase. Copper transport here involves the protein ceruloplasmin, which carries the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5&nbsp;mg a day, vs. about 1&nbsp;mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.</p>\n<h3>Copper-based disorders</h3>\n<p>Because of its role in facilitating iron uptake, copper deficiency can produce anemia-like symptoms, neutropenia, bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism. Conversely, Wilson's disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.</p>\n<p>Severe deficiency can be found by testing for low plasma or serum copper levels, low ceruloplasmin, and low red blood cell superoxide dismutase levels; these are not sensitive to marginal copper status. The \"cytochrome c oxidase activity of leucocytes and platelets\" has been stated as another factor in deficiency, but the results have not been confirmed by replication.</p>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Copper toxicity</div>\n<p>Gram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA. Corresponding amounts of copper salts (30&nbsp;mg/kg) are toxic in animals. A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least 3 ppm in the diet. However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or 500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency, growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages.</p>\n<p>Chronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to Wilson's disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis of the liver in persons who have inherited two defective genes.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Electroplating</li>\n<li>Erosion corrosion of copper water tubes\n<ul>\n<li>Cold water pitting of copper tube</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Metal theft\n<ul>\n<li>Operation Tremor</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Smelter</li>\n<li>Peak copper</li>\n<li>Category:Copper mining companies\n<ul>\n<li>Anaconda Copper</li>\n<li>Antofagasta PLC</li>\n<li>Bingham Canyon Mine</li>\n<li>Codelco</li>\n<li>Grasberg mine</li>\n<li>El Boleo mine</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds in Lide, D.

  "title": "Zinc",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the metallic element.  For other uses, see Zinc (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Zinc</b>, in commerce also <b>spelter</b>, is a metallic chemical element; it has the symbol <b>Zn</b> and atomic number 30. It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table. Zinc is, in some respects, chemically similar to magnesium, because its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).</p>\n<p>Brass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc, has been used since at least the 10th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC. Zinc metal was not produced in large scale until the 12th century in India, while the metal was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to 6th Century BC. To date the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, Rajasthan as early as 9th century AD, when distilation process was employed to make pure zinc.Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called \"philosopher's wool\" or \"white snow.\"</p>\n<p>The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word <i>Zinke</i>. German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is normally given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys, such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.</p>\n<p>Zinc is an essential mineral of \"exceptional biologic and public health importance\". Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children it causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea, contributing to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia, lethargy and copper deficiency.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Zinc, also referred to in nonscientific contexts as <i>spelter</i>, is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal, though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure.</p>\n<p>The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150&nbsp;°C. Above 210&nbsp;°C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5&nbsp;°C, 787.1&nbsp;F) and boiling points (907&nbsp;°C). Its melting point is the lowest of all the transition metals aside from mercury and cadmium.</p>\n<p>Many alloys contain zinc, including brass, an alloy of copper and zinc. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium and sodium. While neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic, their alloy ZrZn\n2 exhibits ferromagnetism below 35&nbsp;K.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also: Zinc minerals</div>\n<p>Zinc makes up about 75&nbsp;ppm&nbsp;(0.0075%) of the Earth's crust, making it the 24th most abundant element. Soil contains 5–770&nbsp;ppm of zinc with an average of 64&nbsp;ppm. Seawater has only 30&nbsp;ppb zinc and the atmosphere contains 0.1–4&nbsp;µg/m.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSphalerite (ZnS)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The element is normally found in association with other base metals such as copper and lead in ores. Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers to bond with sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. Sphalerite, which is a form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc.</p>\n<p>Other minerals from which zinc is extracted include smithsonite (zinc carbonate), hemimorphite (zinc silicate), wurtzite (another zinc sulfide), and sometimes hydrozincite (basic zinc carbonate). With the exception of wurtzite, all these other minerals were formed as a result of weathering processes on the primordial zinc sulfides.</p>\n<p>Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At the current rate of consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of zinc</div>\n<p>Five isotopes of zinc occur in nature. Zn is the most abundant isotope (48.63% natural abundance). This isotope has such a long half-life, at 4.3×10&nbsp;a, that its radioactivity can be ignored. Similarly, 70Zn (0.6%), with a half-life of 1.3×10&nbsp;a is not usually considered to be radioactive. The other isotopes found in nature are 66Zn (28%), 67Zn (4%) and 68Zn (19%).</p>\n<p>Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized. 65Zn, which has a half-life of 243.66&nbsp;days, is the most long-lived radioisotope, followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5&nbsp;hours. Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers. Zn has the longest half-life, 13.76 h. The superscript <i>m</i> indicates a metastable isotope. The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray. 61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two. The isotopes 65Zn, 71Zn, 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state.</p>\n<p>The most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with a mass number lower than 66 is electron capture. The decay product resulting from electron capture is an isotope of copper.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>n\n30Zn + e− → n\n29Cu</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with mass number higher than 66 is beta decay (β), which produces an isotope of gallium.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>n\n30Zn → n\n31Ga + e− + ν\ne</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Compounds and chemistry</h2>\n<div>Main article: Compounds of zinc</div>\n<h3>Reactivity</h3>\n<p>Zinc has an electron configuration of [Ar]3d4s and is a member of the group 12 of the periodic table. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent. The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate, Zn\n5(OH)\n6(CO)\n2, by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide. This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.</p>\n<p>Zinc burns in air with a bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of zinc oxide. Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals. Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room temperature with acids. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.</p>\n<p>The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation state. When compounds in this oxidation state are formed the outer shell <i>s</i> electrons are lost, which yields a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [Ar]3d. In aqueous solution an octahedral complex, [Zn(H\n2O)]2+ is the predominant species. The volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285&nbsp;°C indicates the formation of Zn\n2Cl\n2, a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state. No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than +1 or +2 are known. Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist.</p>\n<p>Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell, so its compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of their salts have the same crystal structure and in circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor zinc and magnesium chemistries have much in common. Otherwise there is little similarity. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and it forms much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.</p>\n<p>See also Clemmensen reduction.</p>\n<h3>Zinc(I) compounds</h3>\n<p>Zinc(I) compounds are rare, and requires bulky ligands to stabilize the low oxidation state. Most zinc(I) compounds contains formally the [Zn] core, which is analogous to the [Hg] dimeric cation present in mercury(I) compounds. The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure. The first zinc(I) compound containing the Zn—Zn bond, (η-CMe)Zn, is also the first dimetallocene. The [Zn] ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc metal and zinc(II), and has only been obtained as a yellow glass formed by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl.</p>\n<h3>Zinc (II) compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nZinc acetate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nZinc chloride</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Binary compounds of zinc are known for most of the metalloids and all the nonmetals except the noble gases. The oxide ZnO is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions, but is amphoteric, dissolving in both strong basic and acidic solutions. The other chalcogenides (ZnS, ZnSe, and ZnTe) have varied applications in electronics and optics. Pnictogenides (Zn\n3N\n2, Zn\n3P\n2, Zn\n3As\n2 and Zn\n3Sb\n2), the peroxide (ZnO\n2), the hydride (ZnH\n2), and the carbide (ZnC\n2) are also known. Of the four halides, ZnF\n2 has the most ionic character, whereas the others (ZnCl\n2, ZnBr\n2, and ZnI\n2) have relatively low melting points and are considered to have more covalent character.</p>\n<p>In weak basic solutions containing Zn2+ ions, the hydroxide Zn(OH)\n2 forms as a white precipitate. In stronger alkaline solutions, this hydroxide is dissolved to form zincates ([Zn(OH)]2−). The nitrate Zn(NO)\n2, chlorate Zn(ClO)\n2, sulfate ZnSO\n4, phosphate Zn\n3(PO)\n2, molybdate ZnMoO\n4, cyanide Zn(CN)\n2, arsenite Zn(AsO)\n2, arsenate Zn(AsO)\n2·8H\n2O and the chromate ZnCrO\n4 (one of the few colored zinc compounds) are a few examples of other common inorganic compounds of zinc. One of the simplest examples of an organic compound of zinc is the acetate (Zn(O\n2CCH)\n2).</p>\n<p>Organozinc compounds are those that contain zinc–carbon covalent bonds. Diethylzinc ((C\n2H)\n2Zn) is a reagent in synthetic chemistry. It was first reported in 1848 from the reaction of zinc and ethyl iodide, and was the first compound known to contain a metal–carbon sigma bond.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Ancient use</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLate Roman brass bucket&nbsp;– the Hemmoorer Eimer from Warstade, Germany, second to third century AD</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Various isolated examples of the use of impure zinc in ancient times have been discovered. A possibly prehistoric statuette containing 87.5% zinc was found in a Dacian archaeological site in Transylvania (modern Romania). Ornaments made of alloys that contain 80–90% zinc with lead, iron, antimony, and other metals making up the remainder, have been found that are 2500 years old. The Berne zinc tablet is a votive plaque dating to Roman Gaul made of an alloy that is mostly zinc. Also, some ancient writings appear to mention zinc. The Greek historian Strabo, in a passage taken from an earlier writer of the 4th century BC, mentions \"drops of false silver\", which when mixed with copper make brass. This may refer to small quantities of zinc by-product of smelting sulfide ores. The Charaka Samhita, thought to have been written in 500 BC or before, mentions a metal which, when oxidized, produces <i>pushpanjan</i>, thought to be zinc oxide.</p>\n<p>Zinc ores were used to make the zinc–copper alloy brass many centuries prior to the discovery of zinc as a separate element. Judean brass from the 14th to 10th centuries&nbsp;BC contains 23% zinc. The Book of Genesis, written between the 10th and 5th centuries BC, mentions (in the King James translation) Tubal-cain as an \"instructor of every artificer in brass and iron\" (Genesis 4:22), but since the word nechosheth, translated as \"brass\", also means \"copper\", the significance of this is not clear. Knowledge of how to produce brass spread to Ancient Greece by the 7th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC but few varieties were made.</p>\n<p>The manufacture of brass was known to the Romans by about 30&nbsp;BC. They made brass by heating powdered calamine (zinc silicate or carbonate), charcoal and copper together in a crucible. The resulting calamine brass was then either cast or hammered into shape and was used in weaponry. Some coins struck by Romans in the Christian era are made of what is probably calamine brass. In the West, impure zinc was known from antiquity to exist in the remnants in melting ovens, but it was usually discarded, as it was thought to be worthless.</p>\n<p>Zinc mines at Zawar, near Udaipur in India, have been active since the Mauryan period in the late 1st millennium BC. The smelting of metallic zinc here however appears to have begun around the 12th century AD. One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries. Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period. The Rasaratna Samuccaya, written in approximately the 13th century AD, mentions two types of zinc-containing ores; one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes.</p>\n<h3>Early studies and naming</h3>\n<p>Zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of <i>Yasada</i> or Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala and written about the year 1374. Smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th century in India. The Chinese did not learn of the technique until the 17th century.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nVarious alchemical symbols attributed to the element zinc</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Alchemists burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting zinc oxide on a condenser. Some alchemists called this zinc oxide <i>lana philosophica</i>, Latin for \"philosopher's wool\", because it collected in wooly tufts while others thought it looked like white snow and named it <i>nix album</i>.</p>\n<p>The name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus, a Swiss-born German alchemist, who referred to the metal as \"zincum\" or \"zinken\" in his book <i>Liber Mineralium II</i>, in the 16th century. The word is probably derived from the German zinke, and supposedly meant \"tooth-like, pointed or jagged\" (metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance). <i>Zink</i> could also imply \"tin-like\" because of its relation to German <i>zinn</i> meaning tin. Yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word سنگ <i>seng</i> meaning stone. The metal was also called Indian tin, tutanego, calamine, and spinter.</p>\n<p>German metallurgist Andreas Libavius received a quantity of what he called \"calay\" of Malabar from a cargo ship captured from the Portuguese in 1596. Libavius described the properties of the sample, which may have been zinc. Zinc was regularly imported to Europe from the Orient in the 17th and early 18th centuries, but was at times very expensive.</p>\n<h3>Isolation</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAndreas Sigismund Marggraf is given credit for first isolating pure zinc</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The isolation of metallic zinc in the West may have been achieved independently by several people. Postlewayt's <i>Universal Dictionary</i>, a contemporary source giving technological information in Europe, did not mention zinc before 1751 but the element was studied before then.</p>\n<p>Flemish metallurgist P.M. de Respour reported that he extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668. By the start of the 18th century, Étienne François Geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore being smelted. In Britain, John Lane is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc, probably at Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.</p>\n<p>In 1738, William Champion patented in Great Britain a process to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical retort style smelter. His technology was somewhat similar to that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan but there is no evidence that he visited the Orient. Champion's process was used through 1851.</p>\n<p>German chemist Andreas Marggraf normally gets credit for discovering pure metallic zinc even though Swedish chemist Anton von Swab distilled zinc from calamine four years before. In his 1746 experiment, Marggraf heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. This procedure became commercially practical by 1752.</p>\n<h3>Later work</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGalvanization was named after Luigi Galvani.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>William Champion's brother, John, patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process. Prior to this only calamine could be used to produce zinc. In 1798, Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter. Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium, which processed even more zinc. Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg to twitch. He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect \"animal electricity\". The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection.</p>\n<p>Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, continued researching this effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified galvanic cell, which is made of a plate of copper and a plate of zinc connected to each other externally and separated by an electrolyte. These were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which in turn produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.</p>\n<p>The non-magnetic character of zinc and its lack of color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. The digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<h3>Mining and processing</h3>\n\n<div>Main articles: Zinc mining and Zinc smelting</div>\n<div>See also: List of countries by zinc production</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPercentage of zinc output in 2006 by countries</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Zinc is the fourth most common metal in use, trailing only iron, aluminium, and copper with an annual production of about 12 million tonnes. The world's largest zinc producer is Nyrstar, a merger of the Australian OZ Minerals and the Belgian Umicore. About 70% of the world's zinc originates from mining, while the remaining 30% comes from recycling secondary zinc. Commercially pure zinc is known as Special High Grade, often abbreviated <i>SHG</i>, and is 99.995% pure.</p>\n<p>Worldwide, 95% of the zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which sphalerite ZnS is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron. There are zinc mines throughout the world, with the main mining areas being China, Australia and Peru. China produced 29% of the global zinc output in 2010.</p>\n<p>Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy. After grinding the ore, froth flotation, which selectively separates minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity, is used to get an ore concentrate. A final concentration of zinc of about 50% is reached by this process with the remainder of the concentrate being sulfur (32%), iron (13%), and SiO\n2 (5%).</p>\n<p>Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate produced during processing to zinc oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 ZnS + 3 O\n2 → 2 ZnO + 2 SO\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid, which is necessary for the leaching process. If deposits of zinc carbonate, zinc silicate or zinc spinel, like the Skorpion Deposit in Namibia are used for zinc production the roasting can be omitted.</p>\n<p>For further processing two basic methods are used: pyrometallurgy or electrowinning. Pyrometallurgy processing reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at 950 °C (1,740&nbsp;°F) into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor. The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser. The below set of equations demonstrate this process:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 ZnO + C → 2 Zn + CO\n2</dd>\n<dd>ZnO + CO → Zn + CO\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Electrowinning processing leaches zinc from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>ZnO + H\n2SO\n4 → ZnSO\n4 + H\n2O</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>After this step electrolysis is used to produce zinc metal.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 ZnSO\n4 + 2 H\n2O → 2 Zn + 2 H\n2SO\n4 + O\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The sulfuric acid regenerated is recycled to the leaching step.</p>\n<h3>Environmental impact</h3>\n<p>The production for sulfidic zinc ores produces large amounts of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues of process also contain significant amounts of heavy metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach significant amounts of zinc and cadmium, and, as a result, the sediments of the Geul River contain significant amounts of heavy metals. About two thousand years ago emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.</p>\n<p>Levels of zinc in rivers flowing through industrial or mining areas can be as high as 20&nbsp;ppm. Effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50&nbsp;ppb. Concentrations of zinc as low as 2&nbsp;ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHistorically responsible for high heavy metal levels in the Derwent River, the zinc works at Lutana is the largest exporter in Tasmania, generating 2.5% of the state's GDP, and producing over 250 thousand tonnes of zinc per year.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Soils contaminated with zinc through the mining of zinc-containing ores, refining, or where zinc-containing sludge is used as fertilizer, can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc in excess of 500&nbsp;ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. Zinc levels of 2000&nbsp;ppm to 180,000&nbsp;ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Major applications of zinc include (numbers are given for the US)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Galvanizing (55%)</li>\n<li>Alloys (21%)</li>\n<li>Brass and bronze (16%)</li>\n<li>Miscellaneous (8%)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Anti-corrosion and batteries</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHot-dip handrail galvanized crystalline surface</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The metal is most commonly used as an anti-corrosion agent. Galvanization, which is the coating of iron or steel to protect the metals against corrosion, is the most familiar form of using zinc in this way. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893 thousand tonnes of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.</p>\n<p>Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate (Zn\n5(OH)\n6(CO\n3)\n2) forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.</p>\n<p>The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays unattacked. Other similar uses include a plug of zinc attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship.</p>\n<p>With a standard electrode potential (SEP) of −0.76 volts, zinc is used as an anode material for batteries. (More reactive lithium (SEP −3.04 V) is used for anodes in lithium batteries ). Powdered zinc is used in this way in alkaline batteries and sheets of zinc metal form the cases for and act as anodes in zinc–carbon batteries. Zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the zinc-air battery/fuel cell.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>A widely used alloy which contains zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCast brass microstructure at magnification 400x</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes. Alloys of 85–88% zinc, 4–10% copper, and 2–8% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings. Zinc is the primary metal used in making American one cent coins since 1982. The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the impression of a copper coin. In 1994, 33,200 tonnes (36,600 short tons) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States.</p>\n<p>Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An example of this is zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes the production of small and intricate shapes possible. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and therefore fast assembly is possible. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.</p>\n<p>Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. In building facades, roofs or other applications in which zinc is used as sheet metal and for methods such as deep drawing, roll forming or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these kinds of manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p>As a dense, inexpensive, easily worked material, zinc is used as a lead replacement. In the wake of lead concerns, zinc appears in weights for various applications ranging from fishing to tire balances and flywheels.</p>\n<p>Cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy that can be divided into an array of small sensing devices. These devices are similar to an integrated circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma ray photons. When placed behind an absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can also be used to determine the direction of the rays.</p>\n<h3>Other industrial uses</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nZinc oxide is used as a white pigment in paints.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States (2009), is consumed in the form of zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints, and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber. It is also used as a heat disperser for the rubber and acts to protect its polymers from ultraviolet radiation (the same UV protection is conferred to plastics containing zinc oxide). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.</p>\n<p>Zinc chloride is often added to lumber as a fire retardant and can be used as a wood preservative. It is also used to make other chemicals. Zinc methyl (Zn(CH)\n2) is used in a number of organic syntheses. Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks, X-ray and television screens, and luminous paints. Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum. Zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments. Zinc pyrithione is used in antifouling paints.</p>\n<p>Zinc powder is sometimes used as a propellant in model rockets. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction. This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light. Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars.</p>\n<p>64Zn, the most abundant isotope of zinc, is very susceptible to neutron activation, being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65Zn, which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation. Because of this, Zinc Oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of 64Zn before use, this is called depleted zinc oxide. For the same reason, zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons (cobalt is another, better-known salting material). A jacket of isotopically enriched 64Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon, forming a large amount of 65Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon's fallout. Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used. 65Zn is also used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out, or the path and the role of zinc in organisms.</p>\n<p>Zinc dithiocarbamate complexes are used as agricultural fungicides; these include Zineb, Metiram, Propineb and Ziram. Zinc naphthenate is used as wood preservative. Zinc, in the form of ZDDP, is also used as an anti-wear additive for metal parts in engine oil.</p>\n<h3>Dietary supplement</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGNC zinc 50 mg tablets (AU)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Zinc is included in most single tablet over-the-counter daily vitamin and mineral supplements. Preparations include zinc oxide, zinc acetate, and zinc gluconate. It is believed to possess antioxidant properties, which may protect against accelerated aging of the skin and muscles of the body; studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc also helps speed up the healing process after an injury. It is also suspected of being beneficial to the body's immune system. Indeed, zinc deficiency may have effects on virtually all parts of the human immune system. The efficacy of zinc compounds when used to reduce the duration or severity of cold symptoms is controversial. A 2011 systematic review concludes that supplementation yields a mild decrease in duration and severity of cold symptoms.Optimum dosing and formulation have not been determined. The studies included in the 2011 review used a variety of forms and doses of zinc, including zinc gluconate or zinc acetate lozenges and zinc sulfate syrup. The doses ranged from 30 to 160 milligrams per day. The researchers noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Given the variability in the populations studied (no studies from low- or middle-income countries), dose, formulation and duration of zinc used in the included studies, more research is needed to address these variabilities and determine the optimal duration of treatment as well as the dosage and formulations of zinc that will produce clinical benefits without increasing adverse effects, before making a general recommendation for zinc in treatment of the common cold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Zinc serves as a simple, inexpensive, and critical tool for treating diarrheal episodes among children in the developing world. Zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea, but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a 10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes for up to three months.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nZinc gluconate is one compound used for the delivery of zinc as a dietary supplement.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The Age-Related Eye Disease Study determined that zinc can be part of an effective treatment for age-related macular degeneration. Zinc supplementation is an effective treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica, a genetic disorder affecting zinc absorption that was previously fatal to babies born with it.</p>\n<p>Gastroenteritis is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc, and this effect could be due to direct antimicrobial action of the zinc ions in the gastrointestinal tract, or to the absorption of the zinc and re-release from immune cells (all granulocytes secrete zinc), or both. In 2011, researchers at John Jay College of Criminal Justice reported that dietary zinc supplements can mask the presence of drugs in urine. Similar claims have been made in web forums on that topic.</p>\n<p>Although not yet tested as a therapy in humans, a growing body of evidence indicates that zinc may preferentially kill prostate cancer cells. Because zinc naturally homes to the prostate and because the prostate is accessible with relatively non-invasive procedures, its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent in this type of cancer has shown promise. However, other studies have demonstrated that chronic use of zinc supplements in excess of the recommended dosage may actually increase the chance of developing prostate cancer, also likely due to the natural buildup of this heavy metal in the prostate.</p>\n<h3>Topical use</h3>\n<div>Further information: Zinc oxide#Medical</div>\n<p>Topical administration of zinc preparations include ones used on the skin, often in the form of zinc oxide. Zinc preparations can protect against sunburn in the summer and windburn in the winter. Applied thinly to a baby's diaper area (perineum) with each diaper change, it can protect against diaper rash.</p>\n<p>Zinc lactate is used in toothpaste to prevent halitosis. Zinc pyrithione is widely applied in shampoos because of its anti-dandruff function. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even at low concentrations.</p>\n<h3>Organic chemistry</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAddition of diphenylzinc to an aldehyde</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>There are many important organozinc compounds. Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR, the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters, the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane, the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds. The Barbier reaction (1899) which is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors:</p>\n<p>The Negishi coupling is also an important reaction for the formation of new carbon carbon bonds between unsaturated carbon atoms in alkenes, arenes and alkynes. The catalysts are nickel and palladium. A key step in the catalytic cycle is a transmetalation in which a zinc halide exchanges its organic substituent for another halogen with the palladium (nickel) metal center. The Fukuyama coupling is another coupling reaction but this one with a thioester as reactant forming a ketone.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Zinc is an essential trace element, necessary for plants, animals, and microorganisms. Zinc is found in nearly 100 specific enzymes (other sources say 300), serves as structural ions in transcription factors and is stored and transferred in metallothioneins. It is \"typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms\" after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes.</p>\n<p>In proteins, Zn ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and histidine. The theoretical and computational description of this zinc binding in proteins (as well as that of other transition metals) is difficult.</p>\n<p>There are 2-4&nbsp;grams of zinc distributed throughout the human body. Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate and parts of the eye. Semen is particularly rich in zinc, which is a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth.</p>\n<p>In humans, zinc plays \"ubiquitous biological roles\". It interacts with \"a wide range of organic ligands\", and has roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA, signal transduction, and gene expression. It also regulates apoptosis. A 2006 study estimated that about 10% of human proteins (2800) potentially bind zinc, in addition to hundreds which transport and traffic zinc; a similar <i>in silico</i> study in the plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> found 2367 zinc-related proteins.</p>\n<p>In the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can \"modulate brain excitability\". It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning. However it has been called \"the brain's dark horse\" since it also can be a neurotoxin, suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in normal functioning of the brain and central nervous system.</p>\n<h3>Enzymes</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRibbon diagram of human carbonic anhydrase II, with zinc atom visible in the center</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nZinc fingers help read DNA sequences.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Zinc is an efficient Lewis acid, making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions. The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions. Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase, which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide (CO\n2) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.</p>\n<p>In vertebrate blood, carbonic anhydrase converts CO\n2 into bicarbonate and the same enzyme transforms the bicarbonate back into CO\n2 for exhalation through the lungs. Without this enzyme, this conversion would occur about one million times slower at the normal blood pH of 7 or would require a pH of 10 or more. The non-related β-carbonic anhydrase is required in plants for leaf formation, the synthesis of indole acetic acid (auxin) and alcoholic fermentation.</p>\n<p>Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins. A coordinate covalent bond is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.</p>\n<h3>Other proteins</h3>\n<p>Zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers, twists and clusters. Zinc fingers form parts of some transcription factors, which are proteins that recognize DNA base sequences during the replication and transcription of DNA. Each of the nine or ten Zn2+ ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger's structure by coordinately binding to four amino acids in the transcription factor. The transcription factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to the DNA sequence.</p>\n<p>In blood plasma, zinc is bound to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and transferrin (10%). Since transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice-versa. A similar reaction occurs with copper. The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system and intestine use zinc signaling as one way to communicate with other cells.</p>\n<p>Zinc may be held in metallothionein reserves within microorganisms or in the intestines or liver of animals. Metallothionein in intestinal cells is capable of adjusting absorption of zinc by 15–40%. However, inadequate or excessive zinc intake can be harmful; excess zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because metallothionein absorbs both metals.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nReference ranges for blood tests, showing zinc in purple at center-right</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Dietary intake</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFoods &amp; spices containing zinc</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In the U.S., the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is 8&nbsp;mg/day for women and 11&nbsp;mg/day for men. Median intake in the U.S. around 2000 was 9&nbsp;mg/day for women and 14&nbsp;mg/day in men. Oysters, lobster and red meats, especially beef, lamb and liver have some of the highest concentrations of zinc in food.</p>\n<p>The concentration of zinc in plants varies based on levels of the element in soil. When there is adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard). Zinc is also found in beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and blackcurrant.</p>\n<p>Other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements, which come in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, one of the most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies which found low plasma zinc concentrations after zinc oxide and zinc carbonate were consumed compared with those seen after consumption of zinc acetate and sulfate salts. However, harmful excessive supplementation is a problem among the relatively affluent, and should probably not exceed 20&nbsp;mg/day in healthy people, although the U.S. National Research Council set a Tolerable Upper Intake of 40&nbsp;mg/day.</p>\n<p>For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended zinc oxide in cereals as cheap, stable, and as easily absorbed as more expensive forms. A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, including oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas. A 1987 study found that zinc picolinate was better absorbed than zinc gluconate or zinc citrate. However, a study published in 2008 determined that zinc glycinate is the best absorbed of the four dietary supplement types available.</p>\n<h3>Deficiency</h3>\n<div>Main article: Zinc deficiency</div>\n<p>Zinc deficiency is usually due to insufficient dietary intake, but can be associated with malabsorption, acrodermatitis enteropathica, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other chronic illnesses. Symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse. Clinical outcomes include depressed growth, diarrhea, impotence and delayed sexual maturation, alopecia, eye and skin lesions, impaired appetite, altered cognition, impaired host defense properties, defects in carbohydrate utilization, and reproductive teratogenesis. Mild zinc deficiency depresses immunity, although excessive zinc does also. Animals with a diet deficient in zinc require twice as much food in order to attain the same weight gain as animals given sufficient zinc.</p>\n<p>Groups at risk for zinc deficiency include the elderly, children in developing countries, and those with renal insufficiency. The zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc malabsorption.</p>\n<p>Despite some concerns, western vegetarians and vegans have not been found to suffer from overt zinc deficiencies any more than meat-eaters. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soyfoods, nuts, peas, and seeds. However, phytates in many whole-grains and fiber in many foods may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. There is some evidence to suggest that more than the US RDA (15&nbsp;mg) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians. These considerations must be balanced against the fact that there is a paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers, and the most widely used indicator, plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge.</p>\n<p>Nearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc. In children it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea, contributing to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, since many in the developing world have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.</p>\n<h4>Agriculture</h4>\n<p>Zinc deficiency is crop plants' most common micronutrient deficiency; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia, and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<div>Main article: Zinc toxicity</div>\n<h3>Toxicity</h3>\n<p>Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all <i>Daphnia</i> in water.</p>\n<p>The free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining due to the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.</p>\n<p>There is evidence of induced copper deficiency at low intakes of 100–300&nbsp;mg Zn/day; a recent trial had higher hospitalizations for urinary complications compared to placebo among elderly men taking 80&nbsp;mg/day. The USDA RDA is 11 and 8&nbsp;mg Zn/day for men and women, respectively. Even lower levels, closer to the RDA, may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol. Levels of zinc in excess of 500&nbsp;ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. There is also a condition called the zinc shakes or \"zinc chills\" that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials. Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38&nbsp;mg of zinc per gram. There have been cases of disability or even death due to excessive use of these products.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, which can cause anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections. On June 16, 2009, the FDA said that consumers should stop using zinc-based intranasal cold products and ordered their removal from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it. Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes.</p>\n<h3>Poisoning</h3>\n<p>In 1982, the United States Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but made primarily of zinc. With the new zinc pennies, there is the potential for zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1&nbsp;kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis, while another patient, who ingested 12&nbsp;grams of zinc, only showed lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.</p>\n<p>Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs, resulting in the need for medical treatment to remove the foreign body. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, which is commonly fatal in dogs, where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia, and also liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<div>\n<div><b>Listen to this article</b> (info/dl)\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><audio poster=\"//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/icons/fileicon-ogg.png\" controls=\"\" preload=\"none\" data-durationhint=\"3793.09569161\" data-startoffset=\"0\" data-mwtitle=\"Zinc_spoken.ogg\" data-mwprovider=\"wikimediacommons\"><source src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Zinc_spoken.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg; codecs=&quot;vorbis&quot;\" data-title=\"Original Ogg file (99 kbps)\" data-shorttitle=\"Ogg source\" data-width=\"0\" data-height=\"0\" data-bandwidth=\"99139\">Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.<br>\nYou can download the clip or download a player to play the clip in your browser.</audio></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>This audio file was created from a revision of the \"Zinc\" article dated 2012-01-25, and does not reflect subsequent edits to the article.

In this reaction formation of diphenylzinc is accompanied by that of lithium chloride, which unchecked, catalyses the reaction without MIB involvement to the racemic alcohol. The salt is effectively removed by chelation with tetraethylethylene diamine (TEEDA) resulting in an enantiomeric excess of 92%.</li>\n<li>^ Prasad A. S.

  "title": "Gallium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with Galium.</div>\n<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Gallium (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Gallium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Ga</b> and atomic number&nbsp;31. Elemental gallium does not occur in nature, but as the gallium(III) compounds in trace amounts in bauxite and zinc ores. A soft silvery metallic poor metal, elemental gallium is a brittle solid at low temperatures. Held long enough, gallium will melt in the hand as it liquefies at temperature of 29.76 °C (85.57&nbsp;°F) (slightly above room temperature). Its melting point is used as a temperature reference point. The alloy Galinstan (68.5% Ga, 21.5% In, 10% Sn) has an even lower melting point of −19 °C (−2&nbsp;°F), well below the freezing point of water. From its discovery in 1875 until the semiconductor era, gallium was used primarily as an agent to make low-melting alloys.</p>\n<p>Today, almost all gallium is used for microelectronics. Gallium arsenide, the primary use of gallium, is used in microwave circuitry and infrared applications. Gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride, minority semiconductor uses, produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and diode lasers.</p>\n<p>Gallium has no known role in biology. Because gallium(III) and ferric salts behave similarly in biological systems, gallium ions often mimic iron ions in medical applications. Gallium-containing pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals have been developed.</p>\n\n<h2>Physical properties</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCrystallization of gallium from the melt</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Elemental gallium is not found in nature, but it is easily obtained by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a brilliant silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium metal expands by 3.1% when it solidifies, and therefore storage in either glass or metal containers is avoided, due to the possibility of container rupture with freezing. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with only a few materials like silicon, germanium, bismuth and water.</p>\n<p>Gallium attacks most other metals by diffusing into their metal lattice. Gallium, for example, diffuses into the grain boundaries of Al/Zn alloys or steel, making them very brittle. Gallium easily alloys with many metals, and is used in small quantities as a plutonium-gallium alloy in the plutonium cores of nuclear bombs, to help stabilize the plutonium crystal structure.</p>\n<p>The melting point of 302.9146&nbsp;K (29.7646&nbsp;°C, 85.5763&nbsp;°F) is near room temperature, about the average summer time temperatures. Gallium's melting point (mp) is one of the formal temperature reference points in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) established by BIPM. The triple point of gallium of 302.9166&nbsp;K (29.7666&nbsp;°C, 85.5799&nbsp;°F), is being used by NIST in preference to gallium's melting point.</p>\n<p>The unique melting point of gallium allows it to melt in one's hand, and then refreeze if removed. This metal has a strong tendency to supercool below its melting point/freezing point. Seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium is one of the metals (with caesium, rubidium, mercury and likely francium) that are liquid at or near-normal room temperature, and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and (unlike mercury) for having a low vapor pressure at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2477&nbsp;K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the absolute scale, making it the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element. Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin, making it mechanically more difficult to handle (even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions). For this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.</p>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Gallium does not crystallize in any of the simple crystal structures. The stable phase under normal conditions is orthorhombic with 8 atoms in the conventional unit cell. Each atom has only one nearest neighbor (at a distance of 244&nbsp;pm) and six other neighbors within additional 39&nbsp;pm. Many stable and metastable phases are found as function of temperature and pressure.</p>\n<p>The bonding between the two nearest neighbors is covalent, hence Ga dimers are seen as the fundamental building blocks of the crystal. This explains the drop of the melting point compared to its neighbor elements aluminium and indium.</p>\n<p>The physical properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, i.e. have different values along the three major crystallographical axes <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> (see table); for this reason, there is a significant difference between the linear (α) and volume thermal expansion coefficients. The properties of gallium are also strongly temperature-dependent, especially near the melting point. For example, the thermal expansion coefficient increases by several hundred percent upon melting.</p>\n<h2>Chemical properties</h2>\n<div>See also category: Gallium compounds</div>\n<p>Gallium is found primarily in the +3 oxidation state. The +1 oxidation is also attested in some compounds, although they tend to disproportionate into elemental gallium and gallium(III) compounds. What are sometimes referred to as gallium(II) compounds are actually mixed-oxidation state compounds containing both gallium(I) and gallium(III).</p>\n<h3>Chalcogen compounds</h3>\n<p>At room temperature, gallium metal is unreactive towards air and water due to the formation of a passive, protective oxide layer. At higher temperatures, however, it reacts with oxygen in the air to form gallium(III) oxide, Ga\n2O\n3. Reducing Ga\n2O\n3 with elemental gallium in vacuum at 500&nbsp;°C to 700&nbsp;°C yields the dark brown gallium(I) oxide, Ga\n2O. Ga\n2O is a very strong reducing agent, capable of reducing H\n2SO\n4 to H\n2S. It disproportionates at 800&nbsp;°C back to gallium and Ga\n2O\n3.</p>\n<p>Gallium sulfide, Ga\n2S\n3, has 3 possible crystal modifications. It can be made by the reaction of gallium with hydrogen sulfide (H\n2S) at 950&nbsp;°C. Alternatively, Ga(OH)\n3 can also be used at 747&nbsp;°C:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Ga(OH)\n3 + 3 H\n2S → Ga\n2S\n3 + 6 H\n2O</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Reacting a mixture of alkali metal carbonates and Ga\n2O\n3 with H\n2S leads to the formation of <i>thiogallates</i> containing the [Ga\n2S\n4]2− anion. Strong acids decompose these salts, releasing H\n2S in the process. The mercury salt, HgGa\n2S\n4, can be used as a phosphor.</p>\n<p>Gallium also forms sulfides in lower oxidation states, such as gallium(II) sulfide and the green gallium(I) sulfide, the latter of which is produced from the former by heating to 1000&nbsp;°C under a stream of nitrogen.</p>\n<p>The other binary chalcogenides, Ga\n2Se\n3 and Ga\n2Te\n3, have zincblende structure. They are all semiconductors, but are easily hydrolysed, limiting their usefulness.</p>\n<h3>Aqueous chemistry</h3>\n<p>Strong acids dissolve gallium, forming gallium(III) salts such as Ga\n2(SO\n4)\n3 and Ga(NO\n3)\n3. Aqueous solutions of gallium(III) salts contain the hydrated gallium ion, [Ga(H\n2O)\n6]3+. Gallium(III) hydroxide, Ga(OH)\n3, may be precipitated from gallium(III) solutions by adding ammonia. Dehydrating Ga(OH)\n3 at 100&nbsp;°C produces gallium oxide hydroxide, GaO(OH).</p>\n<p>Alkaline hydroxide solutions dissolve gallium, forming <i>gallate</i> salts containing the Ga(OH)−\n4 anion. Gallium hydroxide, which is amphoteric, also dissolves in alkali to form gallate salts. Although earlier work suggested Ga(OH)3−\n6 as another possible gallate anion, this species was not found in later work.</p>\n<h3>Pnictogen compounds</h3>\n<p>Gallium reacts with ammonia at 1050&nbsp;°C to form gallium nitride, GaN. Gallium also forms binary compounds with phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony: gallium phosphide (GaP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and gallium antimonide (GaSb). These compounds have the same structure as ZnS, and have important semiconducting properties. GaP, GaAs, and GaSb can be synthesized by the direct reaction of gallium with elemental phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony. They exhibit higher electrical conductivity than GaN. GaP can also be synthesized by the reaction of Ga\n2O with phosphorus at low temperatures.</p>\n<p>Gallium also forms <i>ternary nitrides</i>; for example:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Li\n3Ga + N\n2 → Li\n3GaN\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Similar compounds with phosphorus and arsenic also exist: Li\n3GaP\n2 and Li\n3GaAs\n2. These compounds are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acids and water.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<div>See also: Gallium halides</div>\n<p>Gallium(III) oxide reacts with fluorinating agents such as HF or F\n2 to form gallium(III) fluoride, GaF\n3. It is an ionic compound strongly insoluble in water. However, it does dissolve in hydrofluoric acid, in which it forms an adduct with water, GaF\n3·3H\n2O. Attempting to dehydrate this adduct instead forms GaF\n2OH·nH\n2O. The adduct reacts with ammonia to form GaF\n3·3NH\n3, which can then be heated to form anhydrous GaF\n3.</p>\n<p>Gallium trichloride is formed by the reaction of gallium metal with chlorine gas. Unlike the trifluoride, gallium(III) chloride exists as dimeric molecules, Ga\n2Cl\n6, with a melting point of 78&nbsp;°C. This is also the case for the bromide and iodide, Ga\n2Br\n6 and Ga\n2I\n6.</p>\n<p>Like the other group 13 trihalides, gallium(III) halides are Lewis acids, reacting as halide acceptors with alkali metal halides to form salts containing GaX−\n4 anions, where X is a halogen. They also react with alkyl halides to form carbocations and GaX−\n4.</p>\n<p>When heated to a high temperature, gallium(III) halides react with elemental gallium to form the respective gallium(I) halides. For example, GaCl\n3 reacts with Ga to form GaCl:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Ga + GaCl\n3  3 GaCl (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>At lower temperatures, the equilibrium shifts toward the left and GaCl disproportionates back to elemental gallium and GaCl\n3. GaCl can also be made by the reaction of Ga with HCl at 950&nbsp;°C; it can then be condensed as red solid.</p>\n<p>Gallium(I) compounds can be stabilized by forming adducts with Lewis acids. For example:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>GaCl + AlCl\n3 → Ga+[AlCl\n4]−</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The so-called \"gallium(II) halides\", GaX\n2, are actually adducts of gallium(I) halides with the respective gallium(III) halides, having the structure Ga+[GaX\n4]−. For example:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>GaCl + GaCl\n3 → Ga+[GaCl\n4]−</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Hydrogen compounds</h3>\n<p>Like aluminium, gallium also forms a hydride, GaH\n3, known as <i>gallane</i>, which may be obtained by the reaction of lithium gallanate (LiGaH\n4) with gallium(III) chloride at −30&nbsp;°C:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 LiGaH\n4 + GaCl\n3 → 3 LiCl + 4 GaH\n3</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In the presence of dimethyl ether as solvent, GaH\n3 polymerizes to (GaH\n3)\nn. If no solvent is used, the dimer Ga\n2H\n6 (<i>digallane</i>) is formed as a gas. Its structure is similar to diborane, having two hydrogen atoms bridging the two gallium centers, unlike α-AlH\n3 in which aluminium has a coordination number of 6.</p>\n<p>Gallane is unstable above −10&nbsp;°C, decomposing to elemental gallium and hydrogen.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>In 1871, existence of gallium was first predicted by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, who named it \"eka-aluminium\" on the basis of its position in his periodic table. He also predicted several properties of the element, which correspond closely to real gallium properties, such as density, melting point, oxide character and bonding in chloride.</p>\n<p>Gallium was discovered spectroscopically by French chemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875 by its characteristic spectrum (two violet lines) in an examination of a sphalerite sample. Later that year, Lecoq obtained the free metal by electrolysis of its hydroxide in potassium hydroxide solution. He named the element \"gallia\", from Latin <i>Gallia</i> meaning Gaul, after his native land of France. It was later claimed that, in one of those multilingual puns so beloved of men of science in the 19th century, he had also named gallium after himself, as his name, \"Le coq\", is the French for \"the rooster\", and the Latin for \"rooster\" is \"<i>gallus</i>\"; however, in an 1877 article Lecoq denied this supposition. (Cf. the naming of the J/ψ meson and the dwarf planet Pluto.)</p>\n<p>From its discovery in 1875 up to the era of semiconductors, its primary uses were in high-temperature thermometric applications and in preparation of metal alloys with unusual properties of stability, or ease of melting; some being liquid at room temperature or below. The development of gallium arsenide as a direct band gap semiconductor in the 1960s ushered in the most important stage in the applications of gallium.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<p>Gallium does not exist in free form in nature, and the few high-gallium minerals such as gallite (CuGaS) are too rare to serve as a primary source of the element or its compounds. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is approximately 16.9&nbsp;ppm. Gallium is found and extracted as a trace component in bauxite and to a small extent from sphalerite. The amount extracted from coal, diaspore and germanite in which gallium is also present is negligible. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates gallium reserves to exceed 1 million tonnes, based on 50 ppm by weight concentration in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores. Some flue dusts from burning coal have been shown to contain small quantities of gallium, typically less than 1% by weight.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n99.9999% (6N) gallium sealed in vacuum ampoule.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Gallium is a byproduct of the production of aluminium and zinc. Whereas the sphalerite for zinc production is the minor source. Most gallium is extracted from the crude aluminium hydroxide solution of the Bayer process for producing alumina and aluminium. A mercury cell electrolysis and hydrolysis of the amalgam with sodium hydroxide leads to sodium gallate. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, further purification is carried out using zone melting, or else single crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially widely available.</p>\n<p>In 1986, the production was estimated at 40 tons. In 2007 the production of gallium was 184 tonnes with less than 100 tonnes from mining and the rest from scrap recycling. By 2011 world production of gallium was an estimated 216 metric tons.<br></p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>The semiconductor applications dominate the commercial use of gallium, accounting for 98% of applications. The next major application is for gadolinium gallium garnets.</p>\n<h3>Semiconductors</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGallium-based blue LEDs</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Because of this application, extremely high-purity (99.9999+%) gallium is commercially available. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium nitride (GaN) used in electronic components represented about 98% of the gallium consumption in the United States in 2007. About 66% of semiconductor gallium is used in the U.S. in integrated circuits (mostly gallium arsenide), such as the manufacture of ultra-high speed logic chips and MESFETs for low-noise microwave preamplifiers in cell phones. About 20% is used in optoelectronics. Worldwide, gallium arsenide makes up 95% of the annual global gallium consumption.</p>\n<p>Gallium arsenide is used in optoelectronics in a variety of infrared applications. Aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) is used in high-powered infrared laser diodes. As a component of the semiconductors indium gallium nitride and gallium nitride, gallium is used to produce blue and violet optoelectronic devices, mostly laser diodes and light-emitting diodes. For example, gallium nitride 405&nbsp;nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density compact disc data storage, in the Blu-ray Disc standard.</p>\n<p>Multijunction photovoltaic cells, developed for satellite power applications, are made by molecular beam epitaxy or metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy of thin films of gallium arsenide, indium gallium phosphide or indium gallium arsenide.The Mars Exploration Rovers and several satellites use triple junction gallium arsenide on germanium cells. Gallium is also a component in photovoltaic compounds (such as copper indium gallium selenium sulfide or Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)) for use in solar panels as a cost-efficient alternative to crystalline silicon.</p>\n<h3>Galinstan and other alloys</h3>\n<p>Gallium readily alloys with most metals, and has been used as a component in low-melting alloys. A nearly eutectic alloy of gallium, indium, and tin is a room temperature liquid that is available in medical thermometers. This alloy, with the trade-name <i>Galinstan</i> (with the \"-stan\" referring to the tin), has a low freezing point of −19&nbsp;°C (−2.2&nbsp;°F). It has been suggested that this family of alloys could also be used to cool computer chips in place of water. Gallium alloys have been evaluated as substitutes for mercury dental amalgams, but these materials have yet to see wide acceptance.</p>\n<p>Because gallium wets glass or porcelain, gallium can be used to create brilliant mirrors. When the wetting action of gallium-alloys is not desired (as in Galinstan glass thermometers), the glass must be protected with a transparent layer of gallium(III) oxide.</p>\n<p>The plutonium used in nuclear weapon pits is machined by alloying with gallium to stabilize its δ phase.</p>\n<p>Gallium added in quantities up to 2% in common solders can aid wetting and flow characteristics.</p>\n<p>Alloys of Al and Ga have been evaluated for hydrogen production.</p>\n<p>It is used as alloying element in the magnetic shape-memory alloy Ni-Mn-Ga.</p>\n<h3>Biomedical applications</h3>\n<p>Although gallium has no known role in biology, it mimics iron(III), the gallium ion localizes to and interacts with many processes in the body in which iron(III) is manipulated. As these processes include inflammation, which is a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used, or are in development, as both pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up by bacteria such as <i>Pseudomonas</i>, the bacteria's ability to respire is interfered with and the bacteria die. The mechanism behind this is that iron is redox active, which allows for the transfer of electrons during respiration, but gallium is redox inactive.</p>\n<p>Gallium nitrate (brand name Ganite) has been used as an intravenous pharmaceutical to treat hypercalcemia associated with tumor metastasis to bones. Gallium is thought to interfere with osteoclast function. It may be effective when other treatments for maligancy-associated hypercalcemia are not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gallium maltolate, an orally absorbable form of gallium(III) ion, is in clinical and preclinical trials as a potential treatment for a number of types of cancer, infectious disease, and inflammatory disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A complex amine-phenol Ga(III) compound MR045 was found to be selectively toxic to parasites that have developed resistance to chloroquine, a common drug against malaria. Both the Ga(III) complex and chloroquine act by inhibiting crystallization of hemozoin, a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by the parasites.</p>\n<h4>Radiogallium salts</h4>\n<p>Gallium-67 salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate are used as radiopharmaceutical agents in a nuclear medicine imaging procedure commonly referred to as a gallium scan. The form or salt of gallium is unimportant. For these applications, the radioactive isotope Ga is used. The body handles Ga in many ways as though it were iron, and thus it is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and also areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques. This use has largely been replaced by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for positron emission tomography, \"PET\" scan and indium-111 labelled leukocyte scans. However, the localization of gallium in the body has some properties which make it unique in some circumstances from competing modalities using other radioisotopes.</p>\n<p>Gallium-68, a positron emitter with a half life of 68 min., is now used as a diagnostic radionuclide in PET-CT when linked to pharmaceutical preparations such as DOTATOC, a somatostatin analogue used for neuroendocrine tumors investigation, and DOTA-TATE, a newer one, used for neuroendocrine metastasis and lung neuroendocrine cancer, such as certain types of <i>microcytoma</i>. Galium-68's preparation as a pharmaceutical is chemical and the radionuclide is extracted by elution from germanium-68, a synthetic radioisotope of germanium, in gallium-68 generators.</p>\n<h4>Other uses</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Magnesium gallate containing impurities (such as Mn), is beginning to be used in ultraviolet-activated phosphor powder.</li>\n<li>Neutrino detection. Possibly the largest amount of pure gallium ever collected in a single spot is the Gallium-Germanium Neutrino Telescope used by the SAGE experiment at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in Russia. This detector contains 55–57 tonnes of liquid gallium. Another experiment was the GALLEX neutrino detector operated in the early 1990s in an Italian mountain tunnel. The detector contained 12.2 tons of watered gallium-71. Solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of Ga to become radioactive Ge, which were detected. The solar neutrino flux deduced was found to have a deficit of 40% from theory. This was not explained until better solar neutrino detectors and theories were constructed (see SNO).</li>\n<li>As a liquid metal ion source for a focused ion beam. For example, a focused-gallium-ion beam was used to create the world's smallest book, <i>Teeny Ted from Turnip Town</i>.</li>\n<li>In a classic prank, scientists would fashion gallium spoons and serve tea to unsuspecting guests. The spoons melt in the hot tea.</li>\n<li>As an additive in glide wax for skiis, and other low friction surface materials. US 5069803, Sugimura, Kentaro; Shoji Hasimoto &amp; Takayuki Ono, \"Use of a synthetic resin composition containing gallium particles in the glide surfacing material of skis and other applications\", issued 1995&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>The Ga(III) ion of soluble gallium salts tends to form the insoluble hydroxide when injected in large amounts, and in animals precipitation of this has resulted in renal toxicity. In lower doses, soluble gallium is tolerated well, and does not accumulate as a poison.</p>\n<p>While metallic gallium is not considered toxic, the data are inconclusive. Some sources suggest that it may cause dermatitis from prolonged exposure; other tests have not caused a positive reaction. Like most metals, finely divided gallium loses its luster and powdered gallium appears gray. Thus, when gallium is handled with bare hands, the extremely fine dispersion of liquid gallium droplets, which results from wetting skin with the metal, may appear as a gray skin stain.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Tsai, W.

  "title": "Germanium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with Geranium.</div>\n\n<p><b>Germanium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Ge</b> and atomic number&nbsp;32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Purified germanium is a semiconductor, with an appearance most similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature. Unlike silicon, it is too reactive to be found naturally on Earth in the free (native) state.</p>\n<p>Because very few minerals contain it in high concentration, germanium was discovered comparatively late in the history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties based on its position on his periodic table and called the element <b>ekasilicon</b>. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, Clemens Winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur, in a rare mineral called argyrodite. Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance, its combining ratios in the new element's compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country, Germany. Today, germanium is mined primarily from sphalerite (the primary ore of zinc), though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver, lead, and copper ores.</p>\n<p>Germanium \"metal\" (isolated germanium) is used as semiconductor in transistors and various other electronic devices. Historically the first decade of semiconductor electronics were entirely based on germanium, however its production for such use today is a small fraction (2%) of that of ultra-high purity silicon, which has largely replaced it. Presently, germanium's major end uses are in fibre-optic systems, infrared optics and in solar cell applications. Germanium compounds are also used for polymerization catalysts and have most recently found use in the production of nanowires. This element forms a large number of organometallic compounds, such as tetraethylgermane, which are useful in organometallic chemistry.</p>\n<p>Germanium is not thought to be an essential element for any living organism. Some complexed organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water, and thus have little oral toxicity. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic, and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>See also: History of the transistor</div>\n<p>In his report on <i>The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements</i>, in 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev predicted the existence of several unknown chemical elements, including one that would fill a gap in the carbon family in his Periodic Table of the Elements, located between silicon and tin. Because of its position in his Periodic Table, Mendeleev called it <i>ekasilicon (Es)</i>, and he estimated its atomic weight as about 72.0.</p>\n<p>In mid-1885, at a mine near Freiberg, Saxony, a new mineral was discovered and named <i>argyrodite</i>, because of its high silver content. The chemist Clemens Winkler analyzed this new mineral, which proved to be a combination of silver, sulfur, and a new element. Winkler was able to isolate this new element and found it somewhat similar to antimony, in 1886. Before Winkler published his results on the new element, he decided that he would name his element <i>neptunium</i>, since the recent discovery of planet Neptune in 1846 had been preceded by mathematical predictions of its existence. However, the name \"neptunium\" had already been given to another proposed chemical element (though not the element that today bears the name neptunium, which was discovered in 1940), so instead, Winkler named the new element <i>germanium</i> (from the Latin word, <i>Germania</i>, for Germany) in honor of his homeland. Argyrodite proved empirically to be AgGeS.</p>\n<p>Because this new element showed some similarities with the elements arsenic and antimony, its proper place in the periodic table was under consideration, but its similarities with Dmitri Mendeleev's predicted element \"ekasilicon\" confirmed that it belonged in this place on the periodic table. With further material from 500&nbsp;kg of ore from the mines in Saxony, Winkler confirmed the chemical properties of the new element in 1887. He also determined an atomic weight of 72.32 by analyzing pure germanium tetrachloride (GeCl\n4), while Lecoq de Boisbaudran deduced 72.3 by a comparison of the lines in the spark spectrum of the element.</p>\n<p>Winkler was able to prepare several new compounds of germanium, including its fluorides, chlorides, sulfides, germanium dioxide, and tetraethylgermane (Ge(CH)), the first organogermane. The physical data from these compounds — which corresponded well with Mendeleev's predictions — made the discovery an important confirmation of Mendeleev's idea of element periodicity. Here is a comparison between the prediction and Winkler's data:</p>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Until the late 1930s, germanium was thought to be a poorly conducting metal. Germanium did not become economically significant until after 1945, when its properties as a semiconductor were recognized as being useful in electronics. During World War II, small amounts of germanium had begun to be used in some special electronic devices, mostly diodes. Its first major use was the point-contact Schottky diodes for radar pulse detection during the War. The first silicon-germanium alloys were obtained in 1955. Before 1945, only a few hundred kilograms of germanium were produced in smelters each year, but by the end of the 1950s, the annual worldwide production had reached 40 metric tons.</p>\n<p>The development of the germanium transistor in 1948 opened the door to countless applications of solid state electronics. From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high-purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors, diodes, and rectifiers. For example, the company that became Fairchild Semiconductor was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors. Silicon has superior electrical properties, but it requires much greater purity, which could not be commercially achieved in the early years of semiconductor electronics.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the demand for germanium for use in fiber optics communication networks, infrared night vision systems, and polymerization catalysts increased dramatically. These end uses represented 85% of worldwide germanium consumption in 2000. The US government even designated germanium as a strategic and critical material, calling for a 146&nbsp;ton (132&nbsp;t) supply in the national defense stockpile in 1987.</p>\n<p>Germanium differs from silicon in that the supply for germanium is limited by the availability of exploitable sources, while the supply of silicon is only limited by production capacity since silicon comes from ordinary sand or quartz. As a result, while silicon could be bought in 1998 for less than $10 per kg, the price of 1&nbsp;kg of germanium was then almost $800.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Under standard conditions germanium is a brittle, silvery-white, semi-metallic element. This form constitutes an allotrope technically known as <i>α-germanium</i>, which has a metallic luster and a diamond cubic crystal structure, the same as diamond. At pressures above 120 kbar, a different allotrope known as <i>β-germanium</i> forms, which has the same structure as β-tin. Along with silicon, gallium, bismuth, antimony, and water, it is one of the few substances that expands as it solidifies (i.e. freezes) from its molten state.</p>\n<p>Germanium is a semiconductor. Zone refining techniques have led to the production of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that has an impurity of only one part in 10, making it one of the purest materials ever obtained. The first metallic material discovered (in 2005) to become a superconductor in the presence of an extremely strong electromagnetic field was an alloy of germanium with uranium and rhodium.</p>\n<p>Pure germanium is known to spontaneously extrude very long screw dislocations. They are one of the primary reasons for the failure of older diodes and transistors made from germanium; depending on what they eventually touch, they may lead to an electrical short.</p>\n<h3>Chemistry</h3>\n<div>See also category: Germanium compounds</div>\n<p>Elemental germanium oxidizes slowly to GeO at 250&nbsp;°C. Germanium is insoluble in dilute acids and alkalis but dissolves slowly in concentrated sulfuric acid and reacts violently with molten alkalis to produce germanates ([GeO\n3]2−). Germanium occurs mostly in the oxidation state +4 although many compounds are known with the oxidation state of +2. Other oxidation states are rare, such as +3 found in compounds such as GeCl, and +3 and +1 observed on the surface of oxides, or negative oxidation states in germanes, such as −4 in GeH\n4. Germanium cluster anions (Zintl ions) such as Ge, Ge, Ge, [(Ge)] have been prepared by the extraction from alloys containing alkali metals and germanium in liquid ammonia in the presence of ethylenediamine or a cryptand. The oxidation states of the element in these ions are not integers—similar to the ozonides O.</p>\n<p>Two oxides of germanium are known: germanium dioxide (GeO\n2, germania) and germanium monoxide, (GeO). The dioxide, GeO can be obtained by roasting germanium disulfide (GeS\n2), and is a white powder that is only slightly soluble in water but reacts with alkalis to form germanates. The monoxide, germanous oxide, can be obtained by the high temperature reaction of GeO with Ge metal. The dioxide (and the related oxides and germanates) exhibits the unusual property of having a high refractive index for visible light, but transparency to infrared light. Bismuth germanate, BiGeO, (BGO) is used as a scintillator.</p>\n<p>Binary compounds with other chalcogens are also known, such as the disulfide (GeS\n2), diselenide (GeSe\n2), and the monosulfide (GeS), selenide (GeSe), and telluride (GeTe). GeS forms as a white precipitate when hydrogen sulfide is passed through strongly acid solutions containing Ge(IV). The disulfide is appreciably soluble in water and in solutions of caustic alkalis or alkaline sulfides. Nevertheless, it is not soluble in acidic water, which allowed Winkler to discover the element. By heating the disulfide in a current of hydrogen, the monosulfide (GeS) is formed, which sublimes in thin plates of a dark color and metallic luster, and is soluble in solutions of the caustic alkalis. Upon melting with alkaline carbonates and sulfur, germanium compounds form salts known as thiogermanates.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGermane is similar to methane.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Four tetrahalides are known. Under normal conditions GeI is a solid, GeF a gas and the others volatile liquids. For example, germanium tetrachloride, GeCl, is obtained as a colorless fuming liquid boiling at 83.1&nbsp;°C by heating the metal with chlorine. All the tetrahalides are readily hydrolyzed to hydrated germanium dioxide. GeCl is used in the production of organogermanium compounds. All four dihalides are known and in contrast to the tetrahalides are polymeric solids. Additionally GeCl and some higher compounds of formula GeCl are known. The unusual compound GeCl has been prepared that contains the GeCl unit with a neopentane structure.</p>\n<p>Germane (GeH) is a compound similar in structure to methane. Polygermanes—compounds that are similar to alkanes—with formula GeH containing up to five germanium atoms are known. The germanes are less volatile and less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues. GeH reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline MGeH which contain the GeH anion. The germanium hydrohalides with one, two and three halogen atoms are colorless reactive liquids.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNucleophilic addition with an organogermanium compound.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The first organogermanium compound was synthesized by Winkler in 1887; the reaction of germanium tetrachloride with diethylzinc yielded tetraethylgermane (Ge(C\n2H\n5)\n4). Organogermanes of the type RGe (where R is an alkyl) such as tetramethylgermane (Ge(CH\n3)\n4) and tetraethylgermane are accessed through the cheapest available germanium precursor germanium tetrachloride and alkyl nucleophiles. Organic germanium hydrides such as isobutylgermane ((CH\n3)\n2CHCH\n2GeH\n3) were found to be less hazardous and may be used as a liquid substitute for toxic germane gas in semiconductor applications. Many germanium reactive intermediates are known: germyl free radicals, germylenes (similar to carbenes), and germynes (similar to carbynes). The organogermanium compound 2-carboxyethylgermasesquioxane was first reported in the 1970s, and for a while was used as a dietary supplement and thought to possibly have anti-tumor qualities.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of germanium</div>\n<p>Germanium has five naturally occurring isotopes, 70Ge, 72Ge, 73Ge, 74Ge, 76Ge. Of these, 76Ge is very slightly radioactive, decaying by double beta decay with a half-life of 1.78×10&nbsp;years. 74Ge is the most common isotope, having a natural abundance of approximately 36%. 76Ge is the least common with a natural abundance of approximately 7%. When bombarded with alpha particles, the isotope 72Ge will generate stable 77Se, releasing high energy electrons in the process. Because of this, it is used in combination with radon for nuclear batteries.</p>\n<p>At least 27 radioisotopes have also been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from 58 to 89. The most stable of these is 68Ge, decaying by electron capture with a half-life of 270.95&nbsp;d. The least stable is 60Ge with a half-life of 30&nbsp;ms. While most of germanium's radioisotopes decay by beta decay, 61Ge and 64Ge decay by β+ delayed proton emission. 84Ge through 87Ge isotopes also exhibit minor β− delayed neutron emission decay paths.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also category: Germanium minerals</div>\n<p>Germanium is created through stellar nucleosynthesis, mostly by the s-process in asymptotic giant branch stars. The s-process is a slow neutron capture of lighter elements inside pulsating red giant stars. Germanium has been detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter and in some of the most distant stars. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is approximately 1.6&nbsp;ppm. There are only a few minerals like argyrodite, briartite, germanite, and renierite that contain appreciable amounts of germanium, but no mineable deposits exist for any of them. Some zinc-copper-lead ore bodies contain enough germanium that it can be extracted from the final ore concentrate. An unusual enrichment process causes a high content of germanium in some coal seams, which was discovered by Victor Moritz Goldschmidt during a broad survey for germanium deposits. The highest concentration ever found was in the Hartley coal ash with up to 1.6% of germanium. The coal deposits near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia, contain an estimated 1600&nbsp;tonnes of germanium.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRenierite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>About 118&nbsp;tonnes of germanium was produced in 2011 worldwide, mostly in China (80 t), Russia (5 t) and United States (3 t). Germanium is recovered as a by-product from sphalerite zinc ores where it is concentrated in amounts of up to 0.3%, especially from sediment-hosted, massive Zn–Pb–Cu(–Ba) deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits. Figures for worldwide Ge reserves are not available, but in the US it is estimated at 450&nbsp;tonnes. In 2007 35% of the demand was met by recycled germanium.</p>\n<p>While it is produced mainly from sphalerite, it is also found in silver, lead, and copper ores. Another source of germanium is fly ash of coal power plants which use coal from certain coal deposits with a large concentration of germanium. Russia and China used this as a source for germanium. Russia's deposits are located in the far east of the country on Sakhalin Island. The coal mines northeast of Vladivostok have also been used as a germanium source. The deposits in China are mainly located in the lignite mines near Lincang, Yunnan; coal mines near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia are also used.</p>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>The ore concentrates are mostly sulfidic; they are converted to the oxides by heating under air, in a process known as roasting:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>GeS + 3 O → GeO + 2 SO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Part of the germanium ends up in the dust produced during this process, while the rest is converted to germanates which are leached together with the zinc from the cinder by sulfuric acid. After neutralization only the zinc stays in solution and the precipitate contains the germanium and other metals. After reducing the amount of zinc in the precipitate by the Waelz process, the residing Waelz oxide is leached a second time. The dioxide is obtained as precipitate and converted with chlorine gas or hydrochloric acid to germanium tetrachloride, which has a low boiling point and can be distilled off:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>GeO + 4 HCl → GeCl + 2 HO</dd>\n<dd>GeO + 2 Cl → GeCl + O</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Germanium tetrachloride is either hydrolyzed to the oxide (GeO) or purified by fractional distillation and then hydrolyzed. The highly pure GeO is now suitable for the production of germanium glass. The pure germanium oxide is reduced by the reaction with hydrogen to obtain germanium suitable for the infrared optics or semiconductor industry:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>GeO + 2 H → Ge + 2 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The germanium for steel production and other industrial processes is normally reduced using carbon:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>GeO + C → Ge + CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA typical single-mode optical fiber. Germanium oxide is a dopant of the core silica (Item 1).<br>\n1. Core 8&nbsp;µm<br>\n2. Cladding 125&nbsp;µm<br>\n3. Buffer 250&nbsp;µm<br>\n4. Jacket 400&nbsp;µm</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The major end uses for germanium in 2007, worldwide, were estimated to be: 35% for fiber-optic systems, 30% infrared optics, 15% for polymerization catalysts, and 15% for electronics and solar electric applications. The remaining 5% went into other uses such as phosphors, metallurgy, and chemotherapy.</p>\n<h3>Optics</h3>\n<p>The most notable physical characteristics of germania (GeO) are its high index of refraction and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for wide-angle camera lenses, microscopy, and for the core part of optical fibers. It also replaced titania as the silica dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the need for subsequent heat treatment, which made the fibers brittle. At the end of 2002 the fiber optics industry accounted for 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this use accounts for less than 10% of world wide consumption. GeSbTe is a phase change material used for its optic properties, such as in rewritable DVDs.</p>\n<p>Because germanium is transparent in the infrared it is a very important infrared optical material, that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14&nbsp;micron wavelength range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, night vision system in cars, and fire fighting applications. It is therefore used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment which require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. The material has a very high refractive index (4.0) and so needs to be anti-reflection coated. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental rough treatment.</p>\n<h3>Electronics</h3>\n<p>Silicon-germanium alloys are rapidly becoming an important semiconductor material, for use in high-speed integrated circuits. Circuits utilizing the properties of Si-SiGe junctions can be much faster than those using silicon alone. Silicon-germanium is beginning to replace gallium arsenide (GaAs) in wireless communications devices. The SiGe chips, with high-speed properties, can be made with low-cost, well-established production techniques of the silicon chip industry.</p>\n<p>The recent rise in energy cost has improved the economics of solar panels, a potential major new use of germanium. Germanium is the substrate of the wafers for high-efficiency multijunction photovoltaic cells for space applications.</p>\n<p>Because germanium and gallium arsenide have very similar lattice constants, germanium substrates can be used to make gallium arsenide solar cells. The Mars Exploration Rovers and several satellites use triple junction gallium arsenide on germanium cells.</p>\n<p>Germanium-on-insulator substrates are seen as a potential replacement for silicon on miniaturized chips. Other uses in electronics include phosphors in fluorescent lamps, and germanium-base solid-state light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Germanium transistors are still used in some effects pedals by musicians who wish to reproduce the distinctive tonal character of the \"fuzz\"-tone from the early rock and roll era, most notably the Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA PET bottle</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Germanium dioxide is also used in catalysts for polymerization in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The high brilliance of the produced polyester is especially used for PET bottles marketed in Japan. However, in the United States, no germanium is used for polymerization catalysts. Due to the similarity between silica (SiO) and germanium dioxide (GeO), the silica stationary phase in some gas chromatography columns can be replaced by GeO.</p>\n<p>In recent years germanium has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys. In sterling silver alloys, for instance, it has been found to reduce firescale, increase tarnish resistance, and increase the alloy's response to precipitation hardening. A tarnish-proof sterling silver alloy, trademarked Argentium, requires 1.2% germanium.</p>\n<p>High purity germanium single crystal detectors can precisely identify radiation sources—for example in airport security. Germanium is useful for monochromators for beamlines used in single crystal neutron scattering and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and high energy X-ray applications. Crystals of high purity germanium are used in detectors for gamma spectroscopy and the search for dark matter. The slightly radioactive Germanium 76, which decays only through double-beta decay, is used to study that process (for example, in the ongoing MAJORANA demonstrator experiment).</p>\n<h3>Dietary supplements, pharmaceutical development, and health hazard</h3>\n<p>Germanium is not thought to be essential to the health of plants or animals. Germanium in the environment has little or no health impact. This is primarily because it usually occurs only as a trace element in ores and carbonaceous materials, and is used in very small quantities that are not likely to be ingested, in its various industrial and electronic applications. For similar reasons, germanium in end-uses has little impact on the environment as a biohazard. Some reactive intermediate compounds of germanium are poisonous (see precautions, below).</p>\n<p>As early as 1922, doctors in the United States used the inorganic form of germanium (usually the sesquioxide) to treat patients with anemia. It was used in other forms of treatments, such as a purported immune system booster, but its efficiency has been dubious. Its role in cancer treatments has been debated, with the American Cancer Society contending that no anticancer effects have been demonstrated. U.S. Food and Drug Administration research has concluded that germanium, when used as a nutritional supplement, \"presents potential human health hazard\".</p>\n<p>Certain germanium compounds are available in low dose in the U.S. as nonprescription dietary \"supplements\" in oral capsules or tablets. Other germanium compounds have been administered by alternative medical practitioners as non-FDA-allowed injectable solutions. Soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first, notably the citrate-lactate salt, led to a number of cases of renal dysfunction, hepatic steatosis and peripheral neuropathy in individuals using them on a chronic basis. Plasma and urine germanium concentrations in these individuals, several of whom died, were several orders of magnitude greater than endogenous levels. A more recent organic form, beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide (propagermanium), has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects.</p>\n<p>Certain compounds of germanium have low toxicity to mammals, but have toxic effects against certain bacteria. However, no germanium compound has yet demonstrated a pharmaceutical use, as either an antibacterial or cancer chemotherapeutic agent.</p>\n<h2>Precautions for chemically reactive germanium compounds</h2>\n<p>Some of germanium's artificially-produced compounds are quite reactive and present an immediate hazard to human health on exposure. For example, germanium chloride and germane (GeH) are a liquid and gas, respectively, that can be very irritating to the eyes, skin, lungs, and throat.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Transistor</li>\n<li>Vitrain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ From Greek, argyrodite means silver-containing.</li>\n<li>^ Just as the existence of the new element had been predicted, the existence of the planet Neptune had been predicted in about 1843 by the two mathematicians John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier, using the calculation methods of celestial mechanics. They did this in attempts to explain the fact that the planer Uranus, upon very close observation, appeared to be being pulled slightly out of position in the sky. James Challis started searching for it in July 1846, and he sighted this planet on September 23, 1846.</li>\n<li>^ R. Hermann published claims in 1877 of his discovery of a new element beneath tantalum in the periodic table, which he named neptunium, after the Greek god of the oceans and seas. However this metal was later recognized to be an alloy of the elements niobium and tantalum. The name \"neptunium\" was much later given to the synthetic element one step past uranium in the Periodic Table, which was discovered by nuclear physics researchers in 1940.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^     \"Properties of Germanium\".

  "title": "Arsenic",
  "html": "<p><br></p>\n\n<p><b>Arsenic</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>As</b> and atomic number&nbsp;33. Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in conjunction with sulfur and metals, and also as a pure elemental crystal. It was first documented by Albertus Magnus in 1250. Arsenic is a metalloid. It can exist in various allotropes, although only the gray form has important use in industry.</p>\n<p>The main use of metallic arsenic is for strengthening alloys of copper and especially lead (for example, in car batteries). Arsenic is a common n-type dopant in semiconductor electronic devices, and the optoelectronic compound gallium arsenide is the most common semiconductor in use after doped silicon. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of pesticides, treated wood products, herbicides, and insecticides. These applications are declining, however.</p>\n<p>Arsenic is notoriously poisonous to multicellular life, although a few species of bacteria are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory metabolites. Arsenic contamination of groundwater is a problem that affects millions of people across the world.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical characteristics</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCrystal structure common to Sb, AsSb and gray As</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The three most common arsenic allotropes are <i>metallic gray</i>, <i>yellow</i> and <i>black arsenic</i>, with gray being the most common. <i>Gray arsenic</i> (α-As, space group R3m No. 166) adopts a double-layered structure consisting of many interlocked ruffled six-membered rings. Because of weak bonding between the layers, gray arsenic is brittle and has a relatively low Mohs hardness of 3.5. Nearest and next-nearest neighbors form a distorted octahedral complex, with the three atoms in the same double-layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next. This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 5.73&nbsp;g/cm. Gray arsenic is a semimetal, but becomes a semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.2–1.4 eV if amorphized. Gray Arsenic is also the most stable form.<i>Yellow arsenic</i> is soft and waxy, and somewhat similar to tetraphosphorus (P\n4). Both have four atoms arranged in a tetrahedral structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by a single bond. This unstable allotrope, being molecular, is the most volatile, least dense and most toxic. Solid yellow arsenic is produced by rapid cooling of arsenic vapor, As\n4. It is rapidly transformed into the gray arsenic by light. The yellow form has a density of 1.97 g/cm. <i>Black arsenic</i> is similar in structure to red phosphorus. Black Arsenic can also be formed by cooling vapor at around 100-220 ˚C. It is glassy and brittle. It is also a poor electrical conductor.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of arsenic</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring arsenic is composed of one stable isotope, As. This makes it a monoisotopic element. As of 2003, at least 33 radioisotopes have also been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 60 to 92. The most stable of these is As with a half-life of 80.3&nbsp;days. All other isotopes have half-lives of under one day, with the exception of As (t 17.77 days) and As (t 1.0942 days). Isotopes that are lighter than the stable As tend to decay by β decay, and those that are heavier tend to decay by β decay, with some exceptions.</p>\n<p>At least 10 nuclear isomers have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 66 to 84. The most stable of arsenic's isomers is As with a half-life of 111&nbsp;seconds.</p>\n<h3>Chemistry</h3>\n<p>When heated in air, arsenic oxidizes to arsenic trioxide; the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling garlic. This odor can be detected on striking arsenide minerals such as arsenopyrite with a hammer. Arsenic (and some arsenic compounds) sublimes upon heating at atmospheric pressure, converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at 887 K (614&nbsp;°C). The triple point is 3.63&nbsp;MPa and 1,090 K (820&nbsp;°C). Arsenic makes arsenic acid with concentrated nitric acid, arsenious acid with dilute nitric acid, and arsenic trioxide with concentrated sulfuric acid.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nArsenic burning in the air</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Arsenic compounds</div>\n<p>Arsenic compounds resemble in some respects those of phosphorus, which occupies the same group (column) of the periodic table. Arsenic is less commonly observed in the pentavalent state, however. The most common oxidation states for arsenic are: −3 in the arsenides, such as alloy-like intermetallic compounds; and +3 in the arsenites, arsenates(III), and most organoarsenic compounds. Arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square As3−\n4 ions in the mineral skutterudite. In the +3 oxidation state, arsenic is typically pyramidal, owing to the influence of the lone pair of electrons.</p>\n<h3>Inorganic</h3>\n<p>Arsenic forms colorless, odorless, crystalline oxides AsO (\"white arsenic\") and AsO, which are hygroscopic and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions. Arsenic(V) acid is a weak acid. Its salts are called arsenates, which is the basis of arsenic contamination of groundwater, a problem that affects many people. Synthetic arsenates include Paris Green (copper(II) acetoarsenite), calcium arsenate, and lead hydrogen arsenate. The latter three have been used as agricultural insecticides and poisons.</p>\n<p>The protonation steps between the arsenate and arsenic acid are similar to those between phosphate and phosphoric acid. Unlike phosphorus acid, arsenous acid is genuinely tribasic, with the formula As(OH).</p>\n<p>A broad variety of sulfur compounds of arsenic are known. Orpiment (AsS) and realgar (AsS) are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments. In AsS, arsenic has a formal oxidation state of +2 in AsS, which features As-As bonds so that the total covalency of As is still three.</p>\n<p>All the trihalides of arsenic(III) are well known (except the astatide, which is unknown), whereas only Arsenic pentafluoride (AsF) is the only important pentahalide. Again reflecting the lower stability of the 5+ oxidation state, the pentachloride is stable only below −50&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<h3>Organoarsenic compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: organoarsenic chemistry</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTrimethylarsine</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A large variety of organoarsenic compounds are known. Several were developed as chemical warfare agents during World War I, including vesicants such as lewisite and vomiting agents such as adamsite. Cacodylic acid, which is of historic and practical interest, arises from the methylation of arsenic trioxide, a reaction that has no analogy in phosphorus chemistry.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>Arsenic is used as the group 5 element in the III-V semiconductors gallium arsenide, indium arsenide, and aluminium arsenide. The valence electron count of GaAs is the same as a pair of Si atoms, but the band structure is completely different, which results distinct bulk properties. Other arsenic alloys include the II-IV semiconductor cadmium arsenide.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<div>See also: Arsenide minerals&nbsp;and Arsenate minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA large sample of native arsenic</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Minerals with the formula MAsS and MAs (M = Fe, Ni, Co) are the dominant commercial sources of arsenic, together with realgar (an arsenic sulfide mineral) and native arsenic. An illustrative mineral is arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is structurally related to iron pyrite. Many minor As-containing minerals are known. Arsenic also occurs in various organic forms in the environment. Inorganic arsenic and its compounds, upon entering the food chain, are progressively metabolized to a less toxic form of arsenic through a process of methylation.</p>\n<p>Other naturally occurring pathways of exposure include volcanic ash, weathering of arsenic-containing minerals and ores, and dissolved in groundwater. It is also found in food, water, soil, and air. Arsenic is absorbed by all plants, but is more concentrated in leafy vegetables, rice, apple and grape juice, and seafood. An additional route of exposure is through inhalation.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nArsenic output in 2006</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 2005, China was the top producer of white arsenic with almost 50% world share, followed by Chile, Peru, and Morocco, according to the British Geological Survey and the United States Geological Survey. Most operations in the US and Europe have closed for environmental reasons. The arsenic is recovered mainly as a side product from the purification of copper. Arsenic is part of the smelter dust from copper, gold, and lead smelters.</p>\n<p>On roasting in air of arsenopyrite, arsenic sublimes as arsenic(III) oxide leaving iron oxides, while roasting without air results in the production of metallic arsenic. Further purification from sulfur and other chalcogens is achieved by sublimation in vacuum or in a hydrogen atmosphere or by distillation from molten lead-arsenic mixture.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRealgar</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAlchemical symbol for arsenic</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The word <i>arsenic</i> was borrowed from the Syriac word ܠܐ ܙܐܦܢܝܐ <i>(al) zarniqa</i> and the Persian word زرنيخ <i>Zarnikh</i>, meaning \"yellow orpiment\", into Greek as <i>arsenikon</i> (Αρσενικόν). It is also related to the similar Greek word <i>arsenikos</i> (Αρσενικός), meaning \"masculine\" or \"potent\". The word was adopted in Latin <i>arsenicum</i> and Old French <i>arsenic,</i> from which the English word <i>arsenic</i> is derived. Arsenic sulfides (orpiment, realgar) and oxides have been known and used since ancient times. Zosimos (circa 300 AD) describes roasting <i>sandarach</i> (realgar) to obtain <i>cloud of arsenic</i> (arsenious oxide), which he then reduces to metallic arsenic. As the symptoms of arsenic poisoning were somewhat ill-defined, it was frequently used for murder until the advent of the Marsh test, a sensitive chemical test for its presence. (Another less sensitive but more general test is the Reinsch test.) Owing to its use by the ruling class to murder one another and its potency and discreetness, arsenic has been called the <i>Poison of Kings</i> and the <i>King of Poisons</i>.</p>\n<p>During the Bronze Age, arsenic was often included in bronze, which made the alloy harder (so-called \"arsenical bronze\"). Albertus Magnus (Albert the Great, 1193–1280) is believed to have been the first to isolate the element from a compound in 1250, by heating soap together with arsenic trisulfide. In 1649, Johann Schröder published two ways of preparing arsenic. Crystals of elemental (native) arsenic are found in nature, although rare.</p>\n<p>Cadet's fuming liquid (impure cacodyl), often claimed as the first synthetic organometallic compound, was synthesized in 1760 by Louis Claude Cadet de Gassicourt by the reaction of potassium acetate with arsenic trioxide.</p>\n<p>In the Victorian era, \"arsenic\" (\"white arsenic\" or arsenic trioxide) was mixed with vinegar and chalk and eaten by women to improve the complexion of their faces, making their skin paler to show they did not work in the fields. Arsenic was also rubbed into the faces and arms of women to \"improve their complexion\". The accidental use of arsenic in the adulteration of foodstuffs led to the Bradford sweet poisoning in 1858, which resulted in approximately 20 deaths.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Agricultural</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRoxarsone is a controversial arsenic compound used as a nutritional supplement for chickens</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The toxicity of arsenic to insects, bacteria and fungi led to its use as a wood preservative. In the 1950s a process of treating wood with chromated copper arsenate (also known as CCA or Tanalith) was invented, and for decades this treatment was the most extensive industrial use of arsenic. An increased appreciation of the toxicity of arsenic resulted in a ban for the use of CCA in consumer products; the European Union and United States initiated this process in 2004. CCA remains in heavy use in other countries however, e.g. Malaysian rubber plantations.</p>\n<p>Arsenic was also used in various agricultural insecticides, termination and poisons. For example, lead hydrogen arsenate was a common insecticide on fruit trees, but contact with the compound sometimes resulted in brain damage among those working the sprayers. In the second half of the 20th century, monosodium methyl arsenate (MSMA) and disodium methyl arsenate (DSMA) – less toxic organic forms of arsenic – have replaced lead arsenate in agriculture.</p>\n<p>Arsenic is used as a feed additive in poultry and swine production, in particular in the U.S. to increase weight gain, improve feed efficiency, and to prevent disease. An example is roxarsone, which had been used as a broiler starter by about 70% of U.S. broiler growers. The Poison-Free Poultry Act of 2009 proposes to ban the use of roxarsone in industrial swine and poultry production. Alpharma, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., which produces Roxarsone, voluntarily suspended sales of the drug in response to studies showing elevated levels of inorganic arsenic, a carcinogen, in treated chickens. A successor to Alpharma, Zoetis, continues to sell nitarsone, primarily for use in turkeys.</p>\n<h3>Medical use</h3>\n<p>During the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, a number of arsenic compounds have been used as medicines, including arsphenamine (by Paul Ehrlich) and arsenic trioxide (by Thomas Fowler). Arsphenamine as well as neosalvarsan was indicated for syphilis and trypanosomiasis, but has been superseded by modern antibiotics. Arsenic trioxide has been used in a variety of ways over the past 500 years, but most commonly in the treatment of cancer. The US Food and Drug Administration in 2000 approved this compound for the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia that is resistant to ATRA. It was also used as Fowler's solution in psoriasis. Recently new research has been done in locating tumors using arsenic-74 (a positron emitter). The advantages of using this isotope instead of the previously used iodine-124 is that the signal in the PET scan is clearer as the body tends to transport iodine to the thyroid gland producing a lot of noise.</p>\n<p>In subtoxic doses, soluble arsenic compounds act as stimulants, and were once popular in small doses as medicine by people in the mid-18th century.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>The main use of metallic arsenic is for alloying with lead. Lead components in car batteries are strengthened by the presence of a few percent of arsenic. Dezincification can be strongly reduced by adding arsenic to brass, a copper-zinc alloy. Gallium arsenide is an important semiconductor material, used in integrated circuits. Circuits made from GaAs are much faster (but also much more expensive) than those made in silicon. Unlike silicon it has a direct bandgap, and so can be used in laser diodes and LEDs to directly convert electricity into light.</p>\n<h3>Military</h3>\n<p>After World War I, the United States built up a stockpile of 20,000 tonnes of lewisite (ClCH=CHAsCl), a chemical weapon that is a vesicant (blister agent) and lung irritant. The stockpile was neutralized with bleach and dumped into the Gulf of Mexico after the 1950s. During the Vietnam War the United States used Agent Blue, a mixture of sodium cacodylate and its acid form, as one of the rainbow herbicides to deprive invading North Vietnamese soldiers of foliage cover and rice.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Copper acetoarsenite was used as a green pigment known under many names, including 'Paris Green' and 'Emerald Green'. It caused numerous arsenic poisonings. Scheele's Green, a copper arsenate, was used in the 19th century as a coloring agent in sweets.</li>\n<li>Also used in bronzing and pyrotechnics.</li>\n<li>Up to 2% of arsenic is used in lead alloys for lead shots and bullets.</li>\n<li>Arsenic is added in small quantities to alpha-brass to make it dezincification resistant. This grade of brass is used to make plumbing fittings or other items that are in constant contact with water.</li>\n<li>Arsenic is also used for taxonomic sample preservation.</li>\n<li>Until recently arsenic was used in optical glass. Modern glass manufacturers, under pressure from environmentalists, have removed it, along with lead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>Main article: Arsenic biochemistry</div>\n<h3>Bacteria</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nArsenobetaine</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Some species of bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing various fuels while reducing arsenate to arsenite. Under oxidative environmental conditions some bacteria use arsenite, which is oxidized to arsenate as fuel for their metabolism. The enzymes involved are known as arsenate reductases (Arr).</p>\n<p>In 2008, bacteria were discovered that employ a version of photosynthesis in the absence of oxygen with arsenites as electron donors, producing arsenates (just as ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor, producing molecular oxygen). Researchers conjecture that, over the course of history, these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive. One strain PHS-1 has been isolated and is related to the gammaproteobacterium <i>Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii</i>. The mechanism is unknown, but an encoded Arr enzyme may function in reverse to its known homologues.</p>\n<p>Although the arsenate and phosphate anions are similar structurally, no evidence exists for the replacement of phosphate in ATP or nucleic acids by arsenic.</p>\n<h3>Heredity</h3>\n<p>Arsenic has been linked to epigenetic changes, heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence. These include DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA interference. Toxic levels of arsenic cause significant DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes p16 and p53, thus increasing risk of carcinogenesis. These epigenetic events have been studied <i>in vitro</i> using human kidney cells and <i>in vivo</i> using rat liver cells and peripheral blood leukocytes in humans. Inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used to detect precise levels of intracellular arsenic and its other bases involved in epigenetic modification of DNA. Studies investigating arsenic as an epigenetic factor will help in developing precise biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility.</p>\n<p>The Chinese brake fern (<i>Pteris vittata</i>) hyperaccumulates arsenic present in the soil into its leaves and has a proposed use in phytoremediation.</p>\n<h3>Biomethylation</h3>\n<p>Inorganic arsenic and its compounds, upon entering the food chain, are progressively metabolized through a process of methylation. For example, the mold <i>Scopulariopsis brevicaulis</i> produces significant amounts of trimethylarsine if inorganic arsenic is present. The organic compound arsenobetaine is found in some marine foods such as fish and algae, and also in mushrooms in larger concentrations. The average person's intake is about 10–50&nbsp;µg/day. Values about 1000&nbsp;µg are not unusual following consumption of fish or mushrooms, but there is little danger in eating fish because this arsenic compound is nearly non-toxic.</p>\n<h2>Environmental issues</h2>\n<h3>Occurrence in drinking water</h3>\n<div>Main article: Arsenic contamination of groundwater</div>\n<p>Widespread arsenic contamination of groundwater has led to a massive epidemic of arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh and neighboring countries. It is estimated that approximately 57&nbsp;million people in the Bengal basin are drinking groundwater with arsenic concentrations elevated above the World Health Organization's standard of 10 parts per billion (ppb). However, a study of cancer rates in Taiwan suggested that significant increases in cancer mortality appear only at levels above 150 ppb. The arsenic in the groundwater is of natural origin, and is released from the sediment into the groundwater, owing to the anoxic conditions of the subsurface. This groundwater began to be used after local and western NGOs and the Bangladeshi government undertook a massive shallow tube well drinking-water program in the late twentieth century. This program was designed to prevent drinking of bacteria-contaminated surface waters, but failed to test for arsenic in the groundwater. Many other countries and districts in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Cambodia have geological environments conducive to generation of high-arsenic groundwaters. Arsenicosis was reported in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand in 1987, and the Chao Phraya River is suspected of containing high levels of naturally occurring dissolved arsenic, but has not been a public health problem owing to the use of bottled water.</p>\n<p>In the United States, arsenic is most commonly found in the ground waters of the southwest. Parts of New England, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Dakotas are also known to have significant concentrations of arsenic in ground water. Increased levels of skin cancer have been associated with arsenic exposure in Wisconsin, even at levels below the 10 part per billion drinking water standard, although this link has not been proven. According to a recent film funded by the US Superfund, millions of private wells have unknown arsenic levels, and in some areas of the US, over 20% of wells may contain levels that exceed established limits.</p>\n<p>Low-level exposure to arsenic at concentrations found commonly in US drinking water compromises the initial immune response to H1N1 or swine flu infection according to NIEHS-supported scientists. The study, conducted in laboratory mice, suggests that people exposed to arsenic in their drinking water may be at increased risk for more serious illness or death in response to infection from the virus.</p>\n<p>Some Canadians are drinking water that contains inorganic arsenic. Private dug well waters are most at risk for containing inorganic arsenic. Preliminary well water analyses typically does not test for arsenic. Researchers at the Geological Survey of Canada have modelled relative variation in natural arsenic hazard potential for the province of New Brunswick. This study has important implications for potable water and health concerns relating to inorganic arsenic.</p>\n<p>Epidemiological evidence from Chile shows a dose-dependent connection between chronic arsenic exposure and various forms of cancer, in particular when other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, are present. These effects have been demonstrated to persist below 50 ppb.</p>\n<p>Analyzing multiple epidemiological studies on inorganic arsenic exposure suggests a small but measurable risk increase for bladder cancer at 10 ppb. According to Peter Ravenscroft of the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge, roughly 80 million people worldwide consume between 10 and 50 ppb arsenic in their drinking water. If they all consumed exactly 10 ppb arsenic in their drinking water, the previously cited multiple epidemiological study analysis would predict an additional 2,000 cases of bladder cancer alone. This represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact, since it does not include lung or skin cancer, and explicitly underestimates the exposure. Those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current WHO standard should weigh the costs and benefits of arsenic remediation.</p>\n<p>Early (1973) evaluations of the removal of dissolved arsenic by drinking water treatment processes demonstrated that arsenic is very effectively removed by co-precipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides. The use of iron as a coagulant, in particular, was found to remove arsenic with efficiencies exceeding 90%. Several adsorptive media systems have been approved for point-of-service use in a study funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). A team of European and Indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in West Bengal based on in-situ remediation method (SAR Technology). This technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left as an insoluble form (+5 state) in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and thus developing an oxidation zone to support arsenic oxidizing micro-organisms. This process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap.</p>\n<p>Another effective and inexpensive method to remove arsenic from contaminated well water is to sink wells 500&nbsp;feet or deeper to reach purer waters. A recent 2011 study funded by the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Superfund Research Program shows that deep sediments can remove arsenic and take it out of circulation. Through this process called adsorption in which arsenic sticks to the surfaces of deep sediment particles, arsenic can be naturally removed from well water.</p>\n<p>Magnetic separations of arsenic at very low magnetic field gradients have been demonstrated in point-of-use water purification with high-surface-area and monodisperse magnetite (FeO) nanocrystals. Using the high specific surface area of FeO nanocrystals the mass of waste associated with arsenic removal from water has been dramatically reduced.</p>\n<p>Epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between chronic consumption of drinking water contaminated with arsenic and the incidence of all leading causes of mortality. The literature provides reason to believe arsenic exposure is causative in the pathogenesis of diabetes.</p>\n<p>Hungarian engineer László Schremmer has recently discovered that by the use of chaff-based filters it is possible to reduce the arsenic content of water to 3&nbsp;µg/L. This is especially important in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from the underground aquifer.</p>\n<h3>Wood preservation in the US</h3>\n<p>As of 2002, US-based industries consumed 19,600 metric tons of arsenic. Ninety percent of this was used for treatment of wood with chromated copper arsenate (CCA). In 2007, 50% of the 5,280 metric tons of consumption was still used for this purpose. In the United States, the voluntary phasing-out of arsenic in production of consumer products and residential and general consumer construction products began on December 31, 2003, and alternative chemicals are now used, such as Alkaline Copper Quaternary, borates, copper azole, cyproconazole, and propiconazole.</p>\n<p>Although discontinued, this application is also one of the most concern to the general public. The vast majority of older pressure-treated wood was treated with CCA. CCA lumber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor building material. Although the use of CCA lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding soil (from playground equipment, for instance), a risk is also presented by the burning of older CCA timber. The direct or indirect ingestion of wood ash from burnt CCA lumber has caused fatalities in animals and serious poisonings in humans; the lethal human dose is approximately 20&nbsp;grams of ash. Scrap CCA lumber from construction and demolition sites may be inadvertently used in commercial and domestic fires. Protocols for safe disposal of CCA lumber do not exist evenly throughout the world; there is also concern in some quarters about the widespread landfill disposal of such timber.</p>\n<h3>Mapping of industrial releases in the US</h3>\n<p>One tool that maps releases of arsenic to particular locations in the United States and also provides additional information about such releases is TOXMAP. TOXMAP is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory and Superfund Basic Research Programs. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) and PubMed, and from other authoritative sources.</p>\n<h2>Toxicity and precautions</h2>\n<div>Main articles: Arsenic poisoning and Arsenic toxicity</div>\n<p>Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons. Many water supplies close to mines are contaminated by these poisons. In the United States, the maximum allowed concentration in drinking water is 10 ppb and 5 ppb for bottled water. There is no standard for food, though in 2012 press coverage prompted calls for developing such. The People's Republic of China does have a food standard.</p>\n<p>Elemental arsenic and arsenic compounds are classified as \"toxic\" and \"dangerous for the environment\" in the European Union under directive 67/548/EEC. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recognizes arsenic and arsenic compounds as group 1 carcinogens, and the EU lists arsenic trioxide, arsenic pentoxide and arsenate salts as category 1 carcinogens.</p>\n<p>Arsenic is known to cause arsenicosis owing to its manifestation in drinking water, \"the most common species being arsenate [HAsO2−\n4; As(V)] and arsenite [HAsO; As(III)]\".</p>\n<h3>Biological mechanism</h3>\n<p>The high affinity of arsenic(III) oxides for thiols is usually assigned as the cause of the high toxicity. Thiols, usually in the form of cysteine residues, but also in cofactors such as lipoic acid and coenzyme A, are situated at the active sites of many important enzymes.</p>\n<p>Arsenic disrupts ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits lipoic acid, which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase. In addition, by competing with phosphate, arsenate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which, it is speculated, has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system organ failure. The organ failure is presumed to be from necrotic cell death, not apoptosis, since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur.</p>\n<p>A post mortem in an arsenic poisoning death reveals brick-red-colored mucosa, owing to severe hemorrhage.</p>\n<p>Although arsenic causes toxicity, it can also play a protective role.</p>\n<h3>Exposure risks and remediation</h3>\n<p>Occupational exposure and arsenic poisoning may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds, such as wood preservation, glass production, nonferrous metal alloys, and electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry.</p>\n<p>The ability of arsenic to undergo redox conversion between As(III) and As(V) makes its availability in the environment more abundant. According to Croal, Gralnick, Malasarn and Newman, \"[the] understanding [of] what stimulates As(III) oxidation and/or limits As(V) reduction is relevant for bioremediation of contaminated sites (Croal). The study of chemolithoautotrophic As(III) oxidizers and the heterotrophic As(V) reducers can help the understanding of the oxidation and/or reduction of arsenic.</p>\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\n<p>Treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning is easily accomplished. British anti-lewisite (dimercaprol) is prescribed in doses of 5&nbsp;mg/kg up to 300&nbsp;mg every 4&nbsp;hours for the first day, then every 6&nbsp;hours for the second day, and finally every 8&nbsp;hours for 8 additional days. However the USA's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) states that the long-term effects of arsenic exposure cannot be predicted. Blood, urine, hair, and nails may be tested for arsenic; however, these tests cannot foresee possible health outcomes from the exposure. Excretion occurs in the urine and long-term exposure to arsenic has been linked to bladder and kidney cancer in addition to cancer of the liver, prostate, skin, lungs, and nasal cavity.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Aqua Tofana</li>\n<li>Arsenic biochemistry</li>\n<li>Arsenic compounds</li>\n<li>Arsenic poisoning</li>\n<li>Arsenic toxicity</li>\n<li>Arsenic trioxide</li>\n<li>Fowler's solution</li>\n<li>GFAJ-1</li>\n<li>Grainger challenge</li>\n<li>Hypothetical types of biochemistry</li>\n<li>Organoarsenic chemistry</li>\n<li>White arsenic</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^    Gokcen, N.

  "title": "Selenium",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For the software testing framework, see Selenium (software).</div>\n\n<p><b>Selenium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Se</b> and atomic number&nbsp;34. It is a nonmetal with properties that are intermediate between those of its periodic table column-adjacent chalcogen elements sulfur and tellurium. It rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature, or as pure ore compounds. Selenium (Greek σελήνη <i>selene</i> meaning \"Moon\") was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously-known tellurium (named for the Earth).</p>\n<p>Selenium is found impurely in metal sulfide ores, where it partially replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during copper production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known, but are rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are in glassmaking and in pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Uses in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium continues to be used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.</p>\n<p>Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms, including all animals. Selenium is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants). It is also found in three deiodinase enzymes, which convert one thyroid hormone to another. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts, and others apparently requiring none.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of hexagonal (gray) selenium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Selenium exists in several allotropes that interconvert upon heating and cooling carried out at different temperatures and rates. As prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, which is usually sold industrially as beads. The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS. Upon heating, it softens at 50 °C and converts to gray selenium at 180 °C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.</p>\n<p>The red-colored α, β and γ forms are produced from solutions of black selenium by varying evaporation rates of the solvent (usually CS). They all have relatively low, monoclinic crystal symmetries and contain nearly identical puckered Se rings arranged in different fashions, as in sulfur. The packing is most dense in the α form. In the Se rings, the Se-Se distance is 233.5 pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 105.7 degrees. Other selenium allotropes may contain Se or Se rings.</p>\n<p>The most stable and dense form of selenium has a gray color and hexagonal crystal lattice consisting of helical polymeric chains, wherein the Se-Se distance is 237.3 pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 130.1 degrees. The minimum distance between chains is 343.6 pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten Se, or by condensing Se vapors just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are insulators, gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable photoconductivity. Contrary to other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS. It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the unusual changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of selenium</div>\n<p>Selenium has six naturally occurring isotopes, five of which are stable: Se, Se, Se, Se, and Se. The last three also occur as fission products, along with Se, which has a half-life of 327,000 years. The final naturally occurring isotope, Se, has a very long half-life (~10 yr, decaying via double beta decay to Kr), which, for practical purposes, can be considered to be stable. Twenty-three other unstable isotopes have been characterized.</p>\n<p><i>See also Selenium-79</i> for more information on recent changes in the measured half-life of this long-lived fission product, important for the dose calculations performed in the frame of the geological disposal of long-lived radioactive waste.</p>\n<h2>Chemical compounds</h2>\n<div>See also: Category:Selenium compounds&nbsp;and organoselenium chemistry</div>\n<p>Selenium compounds commonly exist in the oxidation states −2, +2, +4, and +6.</p>\n<h3>Chalcogen compounds</h3>\n<p>Selenium forms two oxides: selenium dioxide (SeO) and selenium trioxide (SeO). Selenium dioxide is formed by the reaction of elemental selenium with oxygen:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Se + 8 O → 8 SeO</dd>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of the polymer SeO. The (pyramidal) Se atoms are yellow.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>It is a polymeric solid that forms monomeric SeO molecules in the gas phase. It dissolves in water to form selenous acid, HSeO. Selenous acid can also be made directly by oxidizing elemental selenium with nitric acid:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 Se + 4 HNO + HO → 3 HSeO + 4 NO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Unlike sulfur, which forms a stable trioxide, selenium trioxide is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes to the dioxide above 185&nbsp;°C:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 SeO → 2 SeO + O (ΔH = −54&nbsp;kJ/mol)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Selenium trioxide is produced in the laboratory by the reaction of anhydrous potassium selenate (KSeO) and sulfur trioxide (SO).</p>\n<p>Salts of selenous acid are called <i>selenites</i>. These include silver selenite (AgSeO) and sodium selenite (NaSeO).</p>\n<p>Hydrogen sulfide reacts with aqueous selenous acid to produce selenium disulfide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>HSeO + 2 HS → SeS + 3 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Selenium disulfide consists of 8-membered rings of a nearly statistical distribution of sulfur and selenium atoms. It has an approximate composition of SeS, with individual rings varying in composition, such as SeS and SeS. Selenium disulfide has been use in shampoo as an anti-dandruff agent, an inhibitor in polymer chemistry, a glass dye, and a reducing agent in fireworks.</p>\n<p>Selenium trioxide may be synthesized by dehydrating selenic acid, HSeO, which is itself produced by the oxidation of selenium dioxide with hydrogen peroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>SeO + HO → HSeO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Hot, concentrated selenic acid is capable of dissolving gold, forming gold(III) selenate.</p>\n<h3>Halogen compounds</h3>\n<p>Iodides of selenium are not well known. The only stable chloride is selenium monochloride (SeCl), which might be better known as selenium(I) chloride; the corresponding bromide is also known. These species are structurally analogous to the corresponding disulfur dichloride. Selenium dichloride is an important reagent in the preparation of selenium compounds (e.g. the preparation of Se). It is prepared by treating selenium with sulfuryl chloride (SOCl). Selenium reacts with fluorine to form selenium hexafluoride:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Se + 24 F → 8 SeF</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In comparison with its sulfur counterpart (sulfur hexafluoride), selenium hexafluoride (SeF) is more reactive and is a toxic pulmonary irritant. Some of the selenium oxyhalides, such as selenium oxyfluoride (SeOF) and selenium oxychloride (SeOCl) have been used as specialty solvents.</p>\n<h3>Selenides</h3>\n<p>Analogous to the behavior of other chalcogens, selenium forms a dihydride HSe. It is a strongly odiferous, toxic, and colorless gas. It is more acidic than HS. In solution it ionizes to HSe. The selenide dianion Se forms a variety of compounds, including the minerals from which selenium is obtained commercially. Illustrative selenides include mercury selenide (HgSe), lead selenide (PbSe), zinc selenide (ZnSe), and copper indium gallium diselenide (Cu(Ga,In)Se). These materials are semiconductors. With highly electropositive metals, such as aluminium, these selenides are prone to hydrolysis:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>AlSe + 6 HO → AlO + 6 HSe</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Alkali metal selenides react with selenium to form polyselenides, Se2−\nx, which exist as chains.</p>\n<h3>Other compounds</h3>\n<p>Tetraselenium tetranitride, SeN, is an explosive orange compound analogous to tetrasulfur tetranitride (SN). It can be synthesized by the reaction of selenium tetrachloride (SeCl) with [((CH\n3)\n3Si)\n2N]\n2Se.</p>\n<p>Selenium reacts with cyanides to yield selenocyanates:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>8 KCN + Se → 8 KSeCN</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Organoselenium compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organoselenium chemistry</div>\n<p>Selenium, especially in the II oxidation state, forms stable bonds to carbon, which are structurally analogous to the corresponding organosulfur compounds. Especially common are selenides (RSe, analogues of thioethers), diselenides (RSe, analogues of disulfides), and selenols (RSeH, analogues of thiols). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively selenomethionine, diphenyldiselenide, and benzeneselenol. The sulfoxide in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, as illustrated by the selenoxide elimination reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the double bond rule, selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Selenium (Greek σελήνη <i>selene</i> meaning \"Moon\") was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Johan Gottlieb Gahn. Both chemists owned a chemistry plant near Gripsholm, Sweden producing sulfuric acid by the lead chamber process. The pyrite from the Falun mine created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, and so the pyrite's use to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn wanted to use the pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like horseradish when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from tellurium compounds. Hence, Berzelius's first letter to Alexander Marcet stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the Falun mine minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to sulfur and tellurium. Because of its similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the Moon.</p>\n<p>In 1873, Willoughby Smith found that the electrical resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first of commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell was used in the photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because of their superior efficiencies. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon rectifiers.</p>\n<p>Selenium came to medical notice later because of its toxicity to human beings working in industries. Selenium was also recognized as an important veterinary toxin, which is seen in animals that have eaten high-selenium plants. In 1954, the first hints of specific biological functions of selenium were discovered in microorganisms. Its essentiality for mammalian life was discovered in 1957. In the 1970s, it was shown to be present in two independent sets of enzymes. This was followed by the discovery of selenocysteine in proteins. During the 1980s, it was shown that selenocysteine is encoded by the codon UGA. The recoding mechanism was worked out first in bacteria and then in mammals (see SECIS element).</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNative selenium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Category:Selenide minerals</div>\n<p>Native (i.e., elemental) selenium is a rare mineral, which does not usually form good crystals, but, when it does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular (hair-like) crystals. Isolation of selenium is often complicated by the presence of other compounds and elements.</p>\n<p>Selenium occurs naturally in a number of inorganic forms, including selenide-, selenate-, and selenite-containing minerals, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is <i>not</i> a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found quite impurely, replacing a small part of the sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.</p>\n<p>In living systems, selenium is found in the amino acids selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl selenide.</p>\n<p>Certain solids are selenium-rich, and selenium can be bioconcentrated by certain plants. In soils, selenium most often occurs in soluble forms such as selenate (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff. Ocean water contains significant amounts of selenium.</p>\n<p>Anthropogenic sources of selenium include coal burning and the mining and smelting of sulfide ores.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Selenium is most commonly produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, such as those of copper, silver, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly conducive to producing selenium as a byproduct, and it is obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants but this method to produce sulfuric acid is no longer used. These muds can be processed by a number of means to obtain selenium. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since the invention of solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) for the production of copper this method takes an increasing share of the world wide copper production. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached together with the copper.</p>\n<p>Industrial production of selenium usually involves the extraction of selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide. The selenium dioxide is then mixed with water and the solution is acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide (reduction step) to give elemental selenium.<br></p>\n<p>About 2,000 tonnes of selenium has been produced in 2011 worldwide, mostly in Germany (650 t), Japan (630 t), Belgium (200 t) and Russia (140 t), and the total reserves were estimated at 93,000 tonnes. These data however exclude two major producers, the United States and China. The price has been relatively stable during 2004–2010 at ~30 US dollars per pound (per 100-pound lot) but has increased to 65 $/lb in 2011. A previous sharp increase was observed in 2004 from 4–5 to 27 $/lb. The consumption in 2010 was divided as follows: metallurgy – 30%, glass manufacturing – 30%, agriculture – 10%, chemicals and pigments – 10%, electronics – 10%. China is the dominant consumer of selenium at 1,500–2,000 tonnes/year.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Manganese electrolysis</h3>\n<p>During the electro winning of manganese an addition of selenium dioxide decreases the power necessary to operate the electrolysis cells. China is the largest consumer of selenium dioxide for this purpose. For every tonne of manganese an average of 2&nbsp;kg selenium oxide is used.</p>\n<h3>Glass production</h3>\n<p>The largest commercial use of Se, accounting for about 50% of consumption, is for the production of glass. Se compounds confer a red color to glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities that are typical for most glass. For this purpose various selenite and selenate salts are added. For other applications, the red color may be desirable, in which case mixtures of CdSe and CdS are added.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>Selenium is used with bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The regulation of lead in drinking water applications with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 made a reduction of lead in brass necessary. The new brass is marketed under the name EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations of 0.15%. The same improvement is also observed in copper alloys and therefore selenium is also used in machinable copper alloys.</p>\n<h4>Solar cells</h4>\n<p>Copper indium gallium selenide is a material used in the production of solar cells.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>Small amounts of organoselenium compounds are used to modify the vulcanization catalysts used in the production of rubber.</p>\n<p>The demand for selenium by the electronics industry is declining, despite a number of continuing applications. Because of its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties, selenium is used in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although it was still a large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to the use of organic photoconductors. It was once widely used in selenium rectifiers. These uses have mostly been replaced by silicon-based devices or are in the process of being replaced. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.</p>\n<p>Zinc selenide was the first material for blue LEDs but gallium nitride is dominating the market now. Cadmium selenide has recently played an important part in the fabrication of quantum dots. Sheets of amorphous selenium convert x-ray images to patterns of charge in xeroradiography and in solid-state, flat-panel x-ray cameras.</p>\n<p>Selenium is a catalyst in some chemical reactions but it is not widely used because of issues with toxicity. In X-ray crystallography, incorporation of one or more selenium atoms in place of sulfur helps with Multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion and Single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing.</p>\n<p>Selenium is used in the toning of photographic prints, and it is sold as a toner by numerous photographic manufacturers. Its use intensifies and extends the tonal range of black-and-white photographic images and improves the permanence of prints.</p>\n<p>Se is used as a gamma source in industrial radiography.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>Main article: Selenium in biology</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Although it is toxic in large doses, selenium is an essential micronutrient for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants such as locoweed require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil). See more on plant nutrition below.</p>\n<p>Selenium is a component of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).</p>\n<p>The glutathione peroxidase family of enzymes (GSH-Px) catalyze certain reactions that remove reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 GSH + HO----GSH-Px → GSSG + 2 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the thyroid gland and in every cell that uses thyroid hormone, by participating as a cofactor for the three of the four known types of thyroid hormone deiodinases, which activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites: the iodothyronine deiodinases are the subfamily of deiodinase enzymes that use selenium as the otherwise rare amino acid selenocysteine. (Only the deiodinase iodotyrosine deiodinase, which works on the last break-down products of thyroid hormone, does not use selenium).</p>\n<p>Selenium may inhibit Hashimoto's disease, in which the body's own thyroid cells are attacked as alien. A reduction of 21% on TPO antibodies was reported with the dietary intake of 0.2&nbsp;mg of selenium.</p>\n<p>Increased dietary selenium intakes reduce the effects of mercury toxicity and it is now recognized that the molecular mechanism of mercury toxicity involves irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues.</p>\n<h3>Evolution in biology</h3>\n<div>Main article: Evolution of dietary antioxidants</div>\n<p>From about three billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein families drive the evolution of selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in utilization of the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-containing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroy peroxide and repair damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-containing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.</p>\n<p>Trace elements involved in GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities, i.e. selenium, vanadium, magnesium, copper, and zinc, may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas. Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their seleno-proteomes, whereas the seleno-proteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost. These findings suggest that, with the exception of vertebrates, aquatic life supports selenium utilization, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element. Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine. From about 500 Mya, freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of \"new\" endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), polyphenols (including flavonoids), tocopherols, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in the last 50–200 million years, in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants. In fact, the angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late Jurassic period.</p>\n<p>The deiodinase isoenzymes constitute another family of eukaryotic selenoproteins with identified enzyme function. Deiodinases are able to extract electrons from iodides, and iodides from iodothyronines. They are, thus, involved in thyroid-hormone regulation, participating in the protection of thyrocytes from damage by HO produced for thyroid-hormone biosynthesis. About 200 Mya, new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSH-Px enzymes. </p>\n<h3>Nutritional sources of selenium</h3>\n<p>Dietary selenium comes from nuts, cereals, meat, mushrooms, fish, and eggs. Brazil nuts are the richest ordinary dietary source (though this is soil-dependent, since the Brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needs). In descending order of concentration, high levels are also found in kidney, tuna, crab, and lobster.</p>\n<p>The human body's content of selenium is believed to be in the 13–20 milligram range.</p>\n<h3>Indicator plant species</h3>\n<p>Certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil, since they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are <i>Astragalus</i> species (including some locoweeds), prince's plume (<i>Stanleya</i> sp.), woody asters (<i>Xylorhiza</i> sp.), and false goldenweed (<i>Oonopsis</i> sp.)</p>\n<h3>Medical use</h3>\n<p>The substance loosely called selenium sulfide (approximate formula SeS) is the active ingredient in some anti-dandruff shampoos. The selenium compound kills the scalp fungus <i>Malassezia</i>, which causes shedding of dry skin fragments. The ingredient is also used in body lotions to treat Tinea versicolor due to infection by a different species of <i>Malassezia</i> fungus.</p>\n<h3>Detection in biological fluids</h3>\n<p>Selenium may be measured in blood, plasma, serum or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in a forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior to being eliminated in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.</p>\n<h3>Toxicity</h3>\n<p>Although selenium is an essential trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis. This 400 microgram (µg) Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to not only avoid toxicity, but also to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to account for data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous shale) have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded in literature.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can result in cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, and death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of their low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites are very toxic, having an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day for a long time. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.</p>\n<p>On 19 April 2009, 21 polo ponies died shortly before a match in the United States Polo Open. Three days later, a pharmacy released a statement explaining that the horses had received an incorrect dose of one of the ingredients used in a vitamin/mineral supplement compound that had been incorrectly compounded by a compounding pharmacy. Analysis of blood levels of inorganic compounds in the supplement indicated the selenium concentrations were ten to fifteen times higher than normal in the horses' blood samples, and 15 to 20 times higher than normal in their liver samples. It was later confirmed that selenium was the ingredient in question.</p>\n<p>Selenium poisoning of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry, undeveloped lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in new \"wetlands\" as the water evaporates. High selenium levels produced in this fashion have been found to have caused certain congenital disorders in wetland birds.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRelationship between survival of juvenile salmon and concentration of selenium in their tissues after 90 days (Chinook salmon) or 45 days (Atlantic salmon) exposure to dietary selenium. The 10% lethality level (LC10=1.84 µg/g) was derived by applying the biphasic model of Brain and Cousens to only the Chinook salmon data. The Chinook salmon data comprise two series of dietary treatments, combined here because the effects on survival are indistinguishable.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In fish and other wildlife, low levels of selenium cause deficiency while high levels cause toxicity. For example, in salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium in the fish tissue (whole body) is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of tissue (dry weight). At levels much below that concentration, young salmon die from selenium deficiency; much above that level they die from toxic excess.</p>\n<h3>Deficiency</h3>\n<div>Main article: Selenium deficiency</div>\n<p>Selenium deficiency is rare in healthy, well-nourished individuals. It can occur in patients with severely compromised intestinal function, those undergoing total parenteral nutrition, and in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although New Zealand has low levels of selenium in its soil, adverse health effects have not been detected.</p>\n<p>Selenium deficiency as defined by low (&lt;60% of normal) selenoenzyme activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues only occurs when a low selenium status is linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury or as a result of increased oxidant stress due to vitamin E deficiency.</p>\n<p>There are interactions between selenium and other nutrients, such as iodine and vitamin E. The effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly in relation to Kashin-Beck disease.</p>\n<p>In some regions (e.g. various regions within North America) where low available selenium levels in soil lead to low concentrations in dry matter of plants, Se deficiency in some animal species may occur unless dietary (or injected) selenium supplementation is done. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than in non-ruminants, and is lower from forages than from grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g. some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because of cyanide from the aglycone released by glucosidase activity in the rumen and inactivation of glutathione peroxidases due to absorbed cyanide's effect on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of WMD (white muscle disease) may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.</p>\n<h3>Controversial health effects</h3>\n<div>Main article: Selenium in biology</div>\n<p>A number of correlative epidemiological studies have implicated selenium deficiency (as measured by blood levels) in a number of serious or chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. In addition, selenium supplementation has been found to be a chemopreventive for some types of cancer in some types of rodents. However, in randomized, blinded, controlled prospective trials in humans, selenium supplementation has not succeeded in reducing the incidence of any disease, nor has a meta-analysis of such selenium supplementation studies detected a decrease in overall mortality.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ACES (nutritional supplement)</li>\n<li>Abundance of elements in Earth's crust</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

  "title": "Bromine",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Bromine</b> (from Greek: βρῶμος, brómos, meaning \"strong-smelling\" or \"stench\") is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Br</b>, and atomic number of 35. It is in the halogen group (17). The element was isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig and Antoine Jerome Balard, in 1825–1826. Elemental bromine is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature, corrosive and toxic, with properties between those of chlorine and iodine. Free bromine does not occur in nature, but occurs as colorless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt.</p>\n<p>Bromine is rarer than about three-quarters of elements in the Earth's crust; however, the high solubility of bromide ion has caused its accumulation in the oceans, and commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. About 556,000 tonnes were produced in 2007, an amount similar to the far more abundant element magnesium.</p>\n<p>At high temperatures, organobromine compounds readily convert to free bromine atoms, a process which has the effect of stopping free radical chemical chain reactions. This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as fire retardants; more than half the bromine produced industrially worldwide each year is put to this use. Unfortunately, the same property causes sunlight to convert volatile organobromine compounds to free bromine atoms in the atmosphere, and an unwanted side effect of this process is ozone depletion. As a result, many organobromide compounds that were formerly in common use—such as the pesticide methyl bromide—have been abandoned. Bromine compounds are still used for certain purposes, however, including in well-drilling fluids, in film photography, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of organic chemicals.</p>\n<p>Bromine has no essential function in mammals, though it is preferentially used over chlorine by one antiparasitic enzyme in the human immune system. Organobromides are needed and produced enzymatically from bromide by some lower life forms in the sea, particularly algae, and the ash of seaweed was one source of bromine's discovery. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion, Br, has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before being replaced by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nIllustrative and secure bromine sample for teaching</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Elemental bromine exists as a diatomic molecule, Br. It is a dense, mobile, slightly transparent reddish-brown liquid, that evaporates easily at standard temperature and pressures to give an orange vapor (its color resembles nitrogen dioxide) that has a strongly disagreeable odor resembling that of chlorine. It is one of only two elements on the periodic table that are known to be liquids at room temperature (mercury is the other, although caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature).</p>\n<p>At a pressure of 55&nbsp;GPa (roughly 540,000 times atmospheric pressure) bromine converts to a metal. At 75&nbsp;GPa it converts to a face centered orthorhombic structure. At 100&nbsp;GPa it converts to a body centered orthorhombic monoatomic form.</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<p>Being less reactive than chlorine but more reactive than iodine, bromine reacts vigorously with metals, especially in the presence of water, to give bromide salts. It is also reactive toward most organic compounds, especially upon illumination, conditions that favor the dissociation of the diatomic molecule into bromine radicals:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Br  2 Br<b>·</b></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It bonds easily with many elements and has a strong bleaching action.</p>\n<p>Bromine is slightly soluble in water, but it is highly soluble in organic solvents such as carbon disulfide, carbon tetrachloride, aliphatic alcohols, and acetic acid.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of bromine</div>\n<p>Bromine has two stable isotopes, Br (50.69%) and Br (49.31%). At least 23 radioisotopes are known. Many of the bromine isotopes are fission products. Several of the heavier bromine isotopes from fission are delayed neutron emitters. All of the radioactive bromine isotopes are relatively short lived. The longest half-life is the neutron deficient Br at 2.376 days. The longest half-life on the neutron rich side is Br at 1.471 days. A number of the bromine isotopes exhibit metastable isomers. Stable Br exhibits a radioactive isomer, with a half-life of 4.86 seconds. It decays by isomeric transition to the stable ground state.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Bromine was discovered independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig and Antoine Balard, in 1825 and 1826, respectively.</p>\n<p>Balard found bromide chemicals in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance resembled that of an intermediate of chlorine and iodine; with those results he tried to prove that the substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element and named it muride, derived from the Latin word <i>muria</i> for brine.</p>\n<p>Löwig isolated bromine from a mineral water spring from his hometown Bad Kreuznach in 1825. Löwig used a solution of the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with diethyl ether. After evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained. With this liquid as a sample for his work he applied for a position in the laboratory of Leopold Gmelin in Heidelberg. The publication of the results was delayed and Balard published his results first.</p>\n<p>After the French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Louis Jacques Thénard, and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac approved the experiments of the young pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the Académie des Sciences and published in <i>Annales de Chimie et Physique</i>. In his publication Balard states that he changed the name from <i>muride</i> to <i>brôme</i> on the proposal of M. Anglada. (<i>Brôme</i> (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench).) Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name <i>brôme</i> for the characteristic smell of the vapors. Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1860.</p>\n<p>The first commercial use, besides some minor medical applications, was the use of bromine for the daguerreotype. In 1840 it was discovered that bromine had some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive silver halide layer used for daguerreotypy.</p>\n<p>Potassium bromide and sodium bromide were used as anticonvulsants and sedatives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, until they were gradually superseded by chloral hydrate and then the barbiturates. In the early years of the First World War, bromine compounds such as xylyl bromide were used as poison gas.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>See also: Category:Halide minerals&nbsp;and Halide mineral</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld bromine production trend</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nView of salt evaporation pans on the Dead Sea, where Jordan (right) and Israel (left) produce salt and bromine 31°9′0″N 35°27′0″E﻿ / ﻿31.15000°N 35.45000°E﻿ / 31.15000; 35.45000</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The diatomic element Br does not occur naturally. Instead, bromine exists exclusively as bromide salts in diffuse amounts in crustal rock. Owing to leaching, bromide salts have accumulated in sea water at 65 part per million (ppm), which is less than chloride. Bromine may be economically recovered from bromide-rich brine wells and from the Dead Sea waters (up to 50,000 ppm). It exists in the Earth's crust at an average concentration of 0.4 ppm, making it the 62nd most abundant element. The bromine concentration in soils varies normally between 5 and 40 ppm, but some volcanic soils can contain up to 500 ppm. The concentration of bromine in the atmosphere is extremely low, at only a few ppt. A large number of organobromine compounds are found in small amounts in nature.</p>\n<p>China's bromine reserves are located in the Shandong Province and Israel's bromine reserves are contained in the waters of the Dead Sea. The largest bromine reserve in the United States is located in Columbia County and Union County, Arkansas, U.S.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Bromine production has increased sixfold since the 1960s. Approximately 556,000 tonnes (worth around US $2.5 billion) was produced in 2007 worldwide, with the predominant contribution from the United States (226,000 t) and Israel (210,000 t). US production was excluded from the United States Geological Survey after 2007, and from the 380,000 tonnes mined by other countries in 2010, 140,000 t were produced by China, 130,000 t by Israel and 80,000 t by Jordan.</p>\n<p>Bromide-rich brines are treated with chlorine gas, flushing through with air. In this treatment, bromide anions are oxidized to bromine by the chlorine gas.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Br + Cl → 2 Cl + Br</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Laboratory methods of production</h3>\n<p>In the laboratory, because of its commercial availability and long shelf-life, bromine is not typically prepared. Small amounts of bromine can however be generated through the reaction of solid sodium bromide with concentrated sulfuric acid (HSO). The first stage is formation of hydrogen bromide (HBr), which is a gas, but under the reaction conditions some of the HBr is oxidized further by the sulfuric acid to form bromine (Br) and sulfur dioxide (SO).</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>NaBr (s) + HSO (aq) → HBr (aq) + NaHSO (aq)</dd>\n<dd>2 HBr (aq) + HSO (aq) → Br (g) + SO (g) + 2 HO (l)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Non oxidizing acid alternatives, such as the use of dilute hydrobromic acid with sodium hypobromite, are also available, as the hypobromous acid formed from them is unstable in the presence of bromide, being reduced by it according to the reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 OBr (aq) + 4 HBr (aq) → 2Br + 2HO + 2Br</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The reactions are the reverse of disproportionation reactions of elemental bromine in base, and are called comproportionation. A similar reaction happens with sodium hypochlorite, acid, and chloride, leading to elemental chlorine.</p>\n<p>Reactions involving an oxidizing agent, such as potassium permanganate or manganese dioxide, on bromide ions in the presence of an acid, also give bromine in the reactions analogous to the formation of elemental chlorine and iodine from an acid and oxidant.</p>\n<p>Like iodine, bromine is soluble in chloroform but only slightly soluble in water. In water, the solubility can be increased by the presence of bromide ions. Concentrated solutions of bromine are rarely prepared in the lab because of hazards. As is the case with chlorine solutions or iodine solutions, sodium thiosulphate (or any soluble thiosulphate) is an effective reagent for reducing bromine to colorless odorless bromide, thus dealing with stains and odor from the element in unwanted places. For the same reason, thiosulfate (\"fixer's hypo\") is used in photography to deal with free bromine in silver bromide film emulsions.</p>\n<h2>Compounds and chemistry</h2>\n\n<h3>Organic chemistry</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organobromine compound</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<i>N</i>-Bromosuccinimide</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As with other halogens, bromine substitutes for hydrogen in hydrocarbons, bonding covalently to carbon. As with other halogens, the C-Br product of this substitution is generally colorless if the corresponding C-H compound is colorless. Addition of covalently bonded bromine tends to increase the density and raise the melting point of organic compounds.</p>\n<p>Organic compounds are brominated by either addition or substitution reactions. Bromine undergoes electrophilic addition to the double-bonds of alkenes, via a cyclic bromonium intermediate. In non-aqueous solvents such as carbon disulfide, this yields the di-bromo product. For example, reaction with ethylene will produce 1,2-dibromoethane. Bromine also undergoes electrophilic addition to phenols and anilines. When used as bromine water, a small amount of the corresponding bromohydrin is formed as well as the dibromo compound. So reliable is the reactivity of bromine that bromine water is employed as a reagent to test for the presence of alkenes, phenols, and anilines. Like the other halogens, bromine participates in free radical reactions. For example, hydrocarbons are brominated upon treatment with bromine in the presence of light.</p>\n<p>Bromine, sometimes with a catalytic amount of phosphorus, easily brominates carboxylic acids at the α-position. This method, the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, is the basis of the commercial route to bromoacetic acid. N-Bromosuccinimide is commonly used as a substitute for elemental bromine, being easier to handle, and reacting more mildly and thus more selectively. Organic bromides are often preferable relative to the less reactive chlorides and more expensive iodide-containing reagents. Thus, Grignard and organolithium compound are most often generated from the corresponding bromides.</p>\n<p>Certain bromine-related compounds have been evaluated to have an ozone depletion potential or bioaccumulate in living organisms. As a result, many industrial bromine compounds are no longer manufactured, are being restricted, or scheduled for phasing out. The Montreal Protocol mentions several organobromine compounds for this phase out.</p>\n<h3>Inorganic chemistry</h3>\n<div>See also: Category:Bromine compounds</div>\n<p>Inorganic bromine compounds adopt a variety of oxidation states from −1 to +7. In nature, bromide (Br) is by far the most common state, and departures from this -1 oxidation state are entirely due to living organisms and bromide's interaction with biologically produced oxidants, such as free oxygen.</p>\n<p>Like other halogens, bromide ion is colorless, and forms a number of transparent ionic mineral salts, analogous to chloride. Bromide ion is highly soluble in water.</p>\n<p>Examples of compounds for bromine's various oxidation states are shown below:</p>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Bromine is an oxidizer, and it will oxidize iodide ions to iodine, being itself reduced to bromide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Br + 2 I → 2 Br + I</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Bromine will also oxidize metals and metalloids to the corresponding bromides. Anhydrous bromine is less reactive toward many metals than hydrated bromine, however. Dry bromine reacts vigorously with aluminium, titanium, mercury as well as alkaline earths and alkali metals.</p>\n<p>Dissolving bromine in alkaline solution gives a mixture of bromide and hypobromite:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Br + 2 OH → Br + OBr + HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This hypobromite is responsible for the bleaching abilities of bromide solutions. Warming of these solutions causes the disproportion reaction of the hypobromite to give bromate, a strong oxidising agent very similar to chlorate.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 BrO− → BrO−\n3 + 2 Br−</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In contrast to the route to perchlorates, perbromates are not accessible through electrolysis but only by reacting bromate solutions with fluorine or ozone.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>BrO + HO + F → BrO−\n4 + 2 HF</dd>\n<dd>BrO + O → BrO−\n4 + O</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Bromine reacts violently and explosively with aluminium metal, forming aluminium bromide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Al + 3 Br → 2 AlBr</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Bromine reacts with hydrogen in gaseous form and gives hydrogen bromide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>H + Br → 2HBr</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Bromine reacts with alkali metal iodides in a displacement reaction. This reaction forms alkali metal bromides and produces elemental iodine:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 NaI + Br → 2 NaBr + I</dd>\n<dd>2 KI + Br → 2 KBr + I</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>A wide variety of organobromine compounds are used in industry. Some are prepared from bromine and others are prepared from hydrogen bromide, which is obtained by burning hydrogen in bromine.</p>\n<p>Illustrative of the addition reaction is the preparation of 1,2-dibromoethane, the organobromine compound produced in the largest amounts:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>CH + Br → CHBrCHBr</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Flame retardant</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTetrabromobisphenol A</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Brominated flame retardants represent a commodity of growing importance, and represent the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterize combustion.</p>\n<p>To make brominated polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can incorporated into the polymer during polymerization. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerization process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerization process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such <b>f</b>lame <b>r</b>etardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerization. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.</p>\n<p>A number of gaseous or highly volatile brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use has been greatly curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CHBrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF).</p>\n<h3>Gasoline additive</h3>\n<p>Ethylene bromide was an additive in gasolines containing lead anti-engine knocking agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted from the engine. This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations (see below).</p>\n<h3>Pesticide</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMethyl bromide (bromomethane)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Poisonous methyl bromide was widely used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone scheduled the phase out for the ozone depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumagation they have been replaced by such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Prior to the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes, fungi, weeds and other soil-borne diseases.</p>\n<h3>Medical and veterinary</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPotassium bromide</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: potassium bromide</div>\n<p><b>Use.</b> Bromide compounds, especially potassium bromide, were frequently used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides in the form of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like Bromo-Seltzer, in 1975. Thus, bromide levels are not routinely measured by medical laboratories in the U.S. However, U.S. veterinary medical diagnostic testing laboratories will measure blood bromide levels on request, as an aid to treatment of epilepsy in dogs.</p>\n<p><b>Toxicity.</b> Long-term use of potassium bromide (or any bromide salt) can lead to bromism. This state of central nervous system depression causes the moderate toxicity of bromide in multi-gram doses for humans and other mammals. The very long half-life of bromide ion in the body (~12 days) also contributes to toxicity from bromide build-up in body fluids. Bromide ingestion may also cause a skin eruption resembling acne.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAgarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Ethidium bromide emits orange light when intercalating DNA and when exposed to UV light.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>The bromides of calcium, sodium, and zinc account for a sizable part of the bromine market. These salts form dense solutions in water that are used as drilling fluids sometimes called <i>clear brine fluids</i>.</li>\n<li>Bromine is also used in the production of brominated vegetable oil, which is used as an emulsifier in many citrus-flavored soft drinks (for example, Mountain Dew). After the introduction in the 1940s the compound was extensively used until the UK and the US limited its use in the mid 1970s and alternative emulsifiers were developed.<br>\nSoft drinks containing brominated vegetable oil are still sold in the US (2013).</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTralomethrin</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Several dyes, agrichemicals, and pharmaceuticals are organobromine compounds. 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane, 1-bromoethylbenzene, and 1-bromoalkanes are prepared by the antimarkovnikov addition of HBr to alkenes. Ethidium bromide, EtBr, is used as a DNA stain in gel electrophoresis.</li>\n<li>High refractive index compounds</li>\n<li>Bromine, like chlorine, is used in maintenance of swimming pools, especially spas (hot tubs), where it is generated in situ from a bromide plus hydrogen peroxide. In spas, the high water temperatures render chlorinated water purification and buffering compounds unstable, and bromine compounds may improve the life of the free-halogen antimicrobial.</li>\n<li>Water purification compounds, disinfectants and insecticides, such as tralomethrin (CHBrNO).</li>\n<li>Potassium bromide is used in some photographic developers to inhibit the formation of fog (undesired reduction of silver).</li>\n<li>Bromine vapor is used as the second step in sensitizing daguerreotype plates to be developed under mercury vapor. Bromine acts as an accelerator to the light sensitivity of the previously iodized plate.</li>\n<li>Bromine is also used to reduce mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants. This can be achieved either by treating activated carbon with bromine or by injecting bromine compounds onto the coal prior to combustion.</li>\n<li>Bromine can also be artificially substituted for the methyl substituent in the nitrogenous base thymine of DNA, creating the base analog 5-bromouracil. When this base is incorporated into DNA its different hydrogen bonding properties may cause mutation at the site of that base pair. The compound 5-bromouracil is thus an artificial mutagen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTyrian purple</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe chemical structure of <b>6,6′-dibromoindigo</b>, the main component of <b>Tyrian Purple</b></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Bromine has no known essential role in human or mammalian health, but inorganic bromine and organobromine compounds do occur naturally, and some may be of use to higher organisms in dealing with parasites. For example, in the presence of HO formed by the eosinophil, and either chloride or bromide ions, eosinophil peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular parasites (such as, for example, the nematode worms involved in filariasis); and also certain bacteria (such as tuberculosis bacteria). Eosinophil peroxidase is a haloperoxidase that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating hypobromite (hypobromous acid).</p>\n<p>Marine organisms are the main source of organobromine compounds. Over 1600 compounds were identified by 1999. The most abundant one is methyl bromide (CHBr) with an estimated 56,000 tonnes produced by marine algae each year. The essential oil of the Hawaiian alga <i>Asparagopsis taxiformis</i> consists of 80% tribromomethane (bromoform). Most of such organobromine compounds in the sea are made via the action of a unique algal enzyme, vanadium bromoperoxidase. Though this enzyme is the most prolific creator of organic bromides by living organisms, other bromoperoxidases exist in nature that do not use vanadium.</p>\n<p>A famous example of a bromine-containing organic compound that has been used by humans since ancient times is the fabric dye Tyrian purple. The brominated indole indigo dye is produced by a medium-sized predatory sea snail, the marine gastropod <i>Murex brandaris</i>. The organobromine nature of the compound was not discovered until 1909 (see Paul Friedländer).</p>\n<h2>Safety</h2>\n<div>See also: List of highly toxic gases</div>\n<p>Elemental bromine is toxic and causes burns. As an oxidizing agent, it is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Care needs to be taken when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames.</p>\n<p>When certain ionic compounds containing bromine are mixed with potassium permanganate (KMnO) and an acidic substance, they will form a pale brown cloud of bromine gas.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>6 Br + 2 MnO−\n4 + 8 H → 3 Br + 2 MnO + 4 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This gas smells like bleach and is very irritating to the mucous membranes. Upon exposure, one should move to fresh air immediately. If symptoms of bromine poisoning arise, medical attention is needed.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^ Turner, Edward (1828).

  "title": "Liquid",
  "html": "<div>For other uses, see Liquid (disambiguation).</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe formation of a spherical droplet of liquid water minimizes the surface area, which is the natural result of surface tension in liquids.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p><b>Liquid</b> is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms and molecules, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Some liquids resist compression, while others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena.</p>\n<p>The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than in a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter. On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as interstellar clouds or in plasma form within stars.</p>\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThermal image of a sink full of hot water with cold water being added, showing how the hot and the cold water flow into each other.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Liquid is one of the three primary states of matter, with the others being solid and gas. A liquid is a fluid. Unlike a solid, the molecules in a liquid have a much greater freedom to move. The forces that bind the molecules together in a solid are only temporary in a liquid, allowing a liquid to flow while a solid remains rigid.</p>\n<p>A liquid, like a gas, displays the properties of a fluid. A liquid can flow, assume the shape of a container, and, if placed in a sealed container, will distribute applied pressure evenly to every surface in the container. Unlike a gas, a liquid may not always mix readily with another liquid, will not always fill every space in the container, forming its own surface, and will not compress significantly, except under extremely high pressures. These properties make a liquid suitable for applications such as hydraulics.</p>\n<p>Liquid particles are bound firmly but not rigidly. They are able to move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the increased vibrations of the molecules causes distances between the molecules to increase. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and the liquid changes to its gaseous state (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature is decreased, the distances between the molecules become smaller. When the liquid reaches its freezing point the molecules will usually lock into a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs).</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<p>Only two elements are liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure: mercury and bromine. Four more elements have melting points slightly above room temperature: francium, caesium, gallium and rubidium. Metal alloys that are liquid at room temperature include NaK, a sodium-potassium metal alloy, galinstan, a fusible alloy liquid, and some amalgams (alloys involving mercury).</p>\n<p>Pure substances that are liquid under normal conditions include water, ethanol and many other organic solvents. Liquid water is of vital importance in chemistry and biology; it is believed to be a necessity for the existence of life.</p>\n<p>Inorganic liquids include water, inorganic nonaqueous solvents and many acids.</p>\n<p>Important everyday liquids include aqueous solutions like household bleach, other mixtures of different substances such as mineral oil and gasoline, emulsions like vinaigrette or mayonnaise, suspensions like blood, and colloids like paint and milk.</p>\n<p>Many gases can be liquefied by cooling, producing liquids such as liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, liquid hydrogen and liquid helium. Not all gases can be liquified at atmospheric pressure, for example carbon dioxide can only be liquified at pressures above 5.1 atm.</p>\n<p>Some materials cannot be classified within the classical three states of matter; they possess solid-like and liquid-like properties. Examples include liquid crystals, used in LCD displays, and biological membranes.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Liquids have a variety of uses, as lubricants, solvents, and coolants. In hydraulic systems, liquid is used to transmit power.</p>\n<p>In tribology, liquids are studied for their properties as lubricants. Lubricants such as oil are chosen for viscosity and flow characteristics that are suitable throughout the operating temperature range of the component. Oils are often used in engines, gear boxes, metalworking, and hydraulic systems for their good lubrication properties.</p>\n<p>Many liquids are used as solvents, to dissolve other liquids or solids. Solutions are found in a wide variety of applications, including paints, sealants, and adhesives. Naptha and acetone are used frequently in industry to clean oil, grease, and tar from parts and machinery. Body fluids are water based solutions.</p>\n<p>Surfactants are commonly found in soaps and detergents. Solvents like alcohol are often used as antimicrobials. They are found in cosmetics, inks, and liquid dye lasers. They are used in the food industry, in processes such as the extraction of vegetable oil.</p>\n<p>Liquids tend to have better thermal conductivity than gases, and the ability to flow makes a liquid suitable for removing excess heat from mechanical components. The heat can be removed by channeling the liquid through a heat exchanger, such as a radiator, or the heat can be removed with the liquid during evaporation. Water or glycol coolants are used to keep engines from overheating. The coolants used in nuclear reactors include water or liquid metals, such as sodium or bismuth. Liquid propellant films are used to cool the thrust chambers of rockets. In machining, water and oils are used to remove the excess heat generated, which can quickly ruin both the work piece and the tooling. During perspiration, sweat removes heat from the human body by evaporating. In the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning industry (HVAC), liquids such as water are used to transfer heat from one area to another.</p>\n<p>Liquid is the primary component of hydraulic systems, which take advantage of Pascal's law to provide fluid power. Devices such as pumps and waterwheels have been used to change liquid motion into mechanical work since ancient times. Oils are forced through hydraulic pumps, which transmit this force to hydraulic cylinders. Hydraulics can be found in many applications, such as automotive brakes and transmissions, heavy equipment, and airplane control systems. Various hydraulic presses are used extensively in repair and manufacturing, for lifting, pressing, clamping and forming.</p>\n<p>Liquids are sometimes used in measuring devices. A thermometer often uses the thermal expansion of liquids, such as mercury, combined with their ability to flow to indicate temperature. A manometer uses the weight of the liquid to indicate air pressure.</p>\n<h2>Mechanical properties</h2>\n<h3>Volume</h3>\n<p>Quantities of liquids are commonly measured in units of volume. These include the SI unit cubic metre (m) and its divisions, in particular the cubic decimetre, more commonly called the litre (1 dm = 1 L = 0.001 m), and the cubic centimetre, also called millilitre (1&nbsp;cm = 1 mL = 0.001 L = 10 m).</p>\n<p>The volume of a quantity of liquid is fixed by its temperature and pressure. Liquids generally expand when heated, and contract when cooled. Water between 0&nbsp;°C and 4&nbsp;°C is a notable exception. Liquids have little compressibility: water, for example, requires a pressure of the order of 200 bar to increase its density by 1/1000. In the study of fluid dynamics, liquids are often treated as incompressible, especially when studying incompressible flow.</p>\n<h3>Pressure and buoyancy</h3>\n<div>Main article: fluid statics</div>\n<p>In a gravitational field, liquids exert pressure on the sides of a container as well as on anything within the liquid itself. This pressure is transmitted in all directions and increases with depth. If a liquid is at rest in a uniform gravitational field, the pressure, <i>p</i>, at any depth, <i>z</i>, is given by</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>where:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd> is the density of the liquid (assumed constant)</dd>\n<dd> is the gravitational acceleration.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Note that this formula assumes that the pressure <i>at</i> the free surface is zero, and that surface tension effects may be neglected.</p>\n<p>Objects immersed in liquids are subject to the phenomenon of buoyancy. (Buoyancy is also observed in other fluids, but is especially strong in liquids due to their high density.)</p>\n<h3>Surfaces</h3>\n<div>Main article: surface science</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSurface waves in water</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Unless the volume of a liquid exactly matches the volume of its container, one or more surfaces are observed. The surface of a liquid behaves like an elastic membrane in which surface tension appears, allowing the formation of drops and bubbles. Surface waves, capillary action, wetting, and ripples are other consequences of surface tension.</p>\n<h3>Flow</h3>\n<div>Main article: fluid mechanics</div>\n<div>Main article: fluid dynamics</div>\n<p>Viscosity measures the resistance of a liquid which is being deformed by either shear stress or extensional stress.</p>\n<p>When a liquid is supercooled towards the glass transition, the viscosity increases dramatically! The liquid then becomes a viscoelastic medium that shows both the elasticity of a solid and the fluidity of a liquid, depending on the time scale of observation or on the frequency of perturbation.</p>\n<h3>Sound propagation</h3>\n<div>Main article: speed of sound#Speed of sound in liquids</div>\n<p>In a fluid the only non-zero stiffness is to volumetric deformation (a fluid does not sustain shear forces). Hence the speed of sound in a fluid is given by  where <i>K</i> is the bulk modulus of the fluid, and <i>ρ</i> the density. To give a typical value, in fresh water <i>c</i>=1497&nbsp;m/s at 25&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<h2>Thermodynamics</h2>\n<h3>Phase transitions</h3>\n<div>Main article: boiling</div>\n<div>Main article: boiling point</div>\n<div>Main article: melting</div>\n<div>Main article: melting point</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA typical phase diagram. The dotted line gives the anomalous behaviour of water. The green lines show how the freezing point can vary with pressure, and the blue line shows how the boiling point can vary with pressure. The red line shows the boundary where sublimation or deposition can occur.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>At a temperature below the boiling point, any matter in liquid form will evaporate until the condensation of gas above reach an equilibrium. At this point the gas will condense at the same rate as the liquid evaporates. Thus, a liquid cannot exist permanently if the evaporated liquid is continually removed. A liquid at its boiling point will evaporate more quickly than the gas can condense at the current pressure. A liquid at or above its boiling point will normally boil, though superheating can prevent this in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>At a temperature below the freezing point, a liquid will tend to crystallize, changing to its solid form. Unlike the transition to gas, there is no equilibrium at this transition under constant pressure, so unless supercooling occurs, the liquid will eventually completely crystallize. Note that this is only true under constant pressure, so e.g. water and ice in a closed, strong container might reach an equilibrium where both phases coexist. For the opposite transition from solid to liquid, see melting.</p>\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\n<div>Main article: solution</div>\n<p>Liquids can display immiscibility. The most familiar mixture of two immiscible liquids in everyday life is the vegetable oil and water in Italian salad dressing. A familiar set of miscible liquids is water and alcohol. Liquid components in a mixture can often be separated from one another via fractional distillation.</p>\n<h2>Microscopic properties</h2>\n<h3>Static structure factor</h3>\n<div>Main article: structure of liquids and glasses</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of a classical monatomic liquid. Atoms have many nearest neighbors in contact, yet no long-range order is present.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In a liquid, atoms do not form a crystalline lattice, nor do they show any other form of long-range order. This is evidenced by the absence of Bragg peaks in X-ray and neutron diffraction. Under normal conditions, the diffraction pattern has circular symmetry, expressing the isotropy of the liquid. In radial direction, the diffraction intensity smoothly oscillates. This is usually described by the static structure factor <i>S(q)</i>, with wavenumber <i>q</i>=(4π/λ)sinθ given by the wavelength λ of the probe (photon or neutron) and the Bragg angle θ. The oscillations of <i>S(q)</i> express the <i>near order</i> of the liquid, i.e. the correlations between an atom and a few shells of nearest, second nearest, ... neighbors.</p>\n<p>A more intuitive description of these correlations is given by the radial distribution function <i>g(r)</i>, which is basically the Fourier transform of <i>S(q)</i>. It represents a spatial average of a temporal snapshot of pair correlations in the liquid.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRadial distribution function of the Lennard-Jones model fluid.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Sound dispersion and structural relaxation</h3>\n<p>The above expression for the sound velocity  contains the bulk modulus <i>K</i>. If <i>K</i> is frequency independent then the liquid behaves as a linear medium, so that sound propagates without dissipation and without mode coupling. In reality, any liquid shows some dispersion: with increasing frequency, <i>K</i> crosses over from the low-frequency, liquid-like limit  to the high-frequency, solid-like limit . In normal liquids, most of this cross over takes place at frequencies between GHz and THz, sometimes called hypersound.</p>\n<p>At sub-GHz frequencies, a normal liquid cannot sustain shear waves: the zero-frequency limit of the shear modulus is . This is sometimes seen as the defining property of a liquid. However, just as the bulk modulus <i>K</i>, the shear modulus <i>G</i> is frequency dependent, and at hypersound frequencies it shows a similar cross over from the liquid-like limit  to a solid-like, non-zero limit .</p>\n<p>According to the Kramers-Kronig relation, the dispersion in the sound velocity (given by the real part of <i>K</i> or <i>G</i>) goes along with a maximum in the sound attenuation (dissipation, given by the imaginary part of <i>K</i> or <i>G</i>). According to linear response theory, the Fourier transform of <i>K</i> or <i>G</i> describes how the system returns to equilibrium after an external perturbation; for this reason, the dispersion step in the GHz..THz region is also called structural relaxation. According the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, relaxation <i>towards</i> equilibrium is intimately connected to fluctuations <i>in</i> equilibrium. The density fluctuations associated with sound waves can be experimentally observed by Brillouin scattering.</p>\n<p>On supercooling a liquid towards the glass transition, the crossover from liquid-like to solid-like response moves from GHz to MHz, kHz, Hz, ...; equivalently, the characteristic time of structural relaxation increases from ns to μs, ms, s, ... This is the microscopic explanation for the above mentioned viscoelastic behaviour of glass-forming liquids.</p>\n<h3>Effects of association</h3>\n<p>The mechanisms of atomic/molecular diffusion (or particle displacement) in solids are closely related to the mechanisms of viscous flow and solidification in liquid materials. Descriptions of viscosity in terms of molecular \"free space\" within the liquid were modified as needed in order to account for liquids whose molecules are known to be \"associated\" in the liquid state at ordinary temperatures. When various molecules combine together to form an associated molecule, they enclose within a semi-rigid system a certain amount of space which before was available as free space for mobile molecules. Thus, increase in viscosity upon cooling due to the tendency of most substances to become <i>associated</i> on cooling.</p>\n<p>Similar arguments could be used to describe the effects of pressure on viscosity, where it may be assumed that the viscosity is chiefly a function of the volume for liquids with a finite compressibility. An increasing viscosity with rise of pressure is therefore expected. In addition, if the volume is expanded by heat but reduced again by pressure, the viscosity remains the same.</p>\n<p>The local tendency to orientation of molecules in small groups lends the liquid (as referred to previously) a certain degree of association. This association results in a considerable \"internal pressure\" within a liquid, which is due almost entirely to those molecules which, on account of their temporary low velocities (following the Maxwell distribution) have coalesced with other molecules. The internal pressure between several such molecules might correspond to that between a group of molecules in the solid form.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Theodore Gray, The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe New York: Workman Publishing, 2009 p. 127 ISBN 1-57912-814-9</li>\n<li>^ Theo Mang, Wilfried Dressel ’’Lubricants and lubrication’’, Wiley-VCH 2007 ISBN 3-527-31497-0</li>\n<li>^ George Wypych ’’Handbook of solvents’’ William Andrew Publishing 2001 pp. 847–881 ISBN 1-895198-24-0</li>\n<li>^ N.

  "title": "Krypton",
  "html": "\n<div></div>\n<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Krypton (disambiguation).</div>\n<p><b>Krypton</b> (from Greek: κρυπτός kryptos \"the hidden one\") is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Kr</b> and atomic number&nbsp;36. It is a member of group 18 (noble gases) elements. A colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, krypton occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere, is isolated by fractionally distilling liquified air, and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. Krypton is inert for most practical purposes.</p>\n<p>Krypton, like the other noble gases, can be used in lighting and photography. Krypton light has a large number of spectral lines, and krypton's high light output in plasmas allows it to play an important role in many high-powered gas lasers (krypton ion and excimer lasers), which pick out one of the many spectral lines to amplify. There is also a specific krypton fluoride laser. The high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes caused (from 1960 to 1983) the official length of a meter to be defined in terms of the 605 nm (red-orange) spectral line of krypton-86.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSir William Ramsay, the discoverer of krypton</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Krypton was discovered in Britain in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris Travers, an English chemist, in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air. Neon was discovered by a similar procedure by the same workers just a few weeks later. William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases, including krypton.</p>\n<p>In 1960, an international agreement defined the meter in terms of wavelength of light emitted by the krypton-86 isotope (wavelength of 605.78 nanometers). This agreement replaced the longstanding standard meter located in Paris, which was a metal bar made of a platinum-iridium alloy (the bar was originally estimated to be one ten-millionth of a quadrant of the Earth's polar circumference), and was itself replaced by a definition based on the speed of light — a fundamental physical constant. However, in 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures had redefined the meter in terms of a red cadmium spectral line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). In October 1983, the same bureau defined the meter as the distance that light travels in a vacuum during 1/299,792,458 s.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Krypton is characterized by several sharp emission lines (spectral signatures) the strongest being green and yellow. It is one of the products of uranium fission. Solidified krypton is white and crystalline with a face-centered cubic crystal structure, which is a common property of all noble gases (except helium, with a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure).</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of krypton</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring krypton is made of six stable isotopes. In addition, about thirty unstable isotopes and isomers are known. Kr, the product of atmospheric reactions, is produced with the other naturally occurring isotopes of krypton. Being radioactive, it has a half-life of 230,000 years. Krypton is highly volatile when it is near surface waters but Kr has been used for dating old (50,000–800,000 years) groundwater.</p>\n<p>Kr is an inert radioactive noble gas with a half-life of 10.76 years. It is produced by the fission of uranium and plutonium, such as in nuclear bomb testing and nuclear reactors. Kr is released during the reprocessing of fuel rods from nuclear reactors. Concentrations at the North Pole are 30% higher than at the South Pole due to convective mixing.</p>\n<h3>Chemistry</h3>\n<p>Like the other noble gases, krypton is chemically unreactive. However, following the first successful synthesis of xenon compounds in 1962, synthesis of krypton difluoride (KrF\n2) was reported in 1963. In the same year, KrF\n4 was reported by Grosse, <i>et al.</i>, but was subsequently shown to be a mistaken identification. There are also unverified reports of a barium salt of a krypton oxoacid. ArKr and KrH polyatomic ions have been investigated and there is evidence for KrXe or KrXe.</p>\n<p>Compounds with krypton bonded to atoms other than fluorine have also been discovered. The reaction of KrF\n2 with B(OTeF\n5)\n3 produces an unstable compound, Kr(OTeF\n5)\n2, that contains a krypton-oxygen bond. A krypton-nitrogen bond is found in the cation [HC≡N–Kr–F]+, produced by the reaction of KrF\n2 with [HC≡NH]+[AsF−\n6] below −50&nbsp;°C. HKrCN and HKrC≡CH (krypton hydride-cyanide and hydrokryptoacetylene) were reported to be stable up to 40 K.</p>\n<h3>Natural occurrence</h3>\n<p>The Earth has retained all of the noble gases that were present at its formation except for helium. Krypton's concentration in the atmosphere is about 1 ppm. It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation. The amount of krypton in space is uncertain, as the amount is derived from the meteoric activity and that from solar winds. The first measurements suggest an overabundance of krypton in space.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nKrypton gas discharge tube</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nKrypton discharge (spectrum) tube</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Krypton's multiple emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear whitish, which in turn makes krypton-based bulbs useful in photography as a brilliant white light source. Krypton is thus used in some types of photographic flashes used in high speed photography. Krypton gas is also combined with other gases to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenish-yellow light.</p>\n<p>Krypton mixes with argon as the fill gas of energy saving fluorescent lamps. This reduces their power consumption. Unfortunately this also reduces their light output and raises their cost. Krypton costs about 100 times as much as argon. Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures to be used for the filament. A brighter light results which contains more blue than conventional lamps.</p>\n<p>Krypton's white discharge is often used to good effect in colored gas discharge tubes, which are then simply painted or stained in other ways to allow the desired color (for example, \"neon\" type advertising signs where the letters appear in differing colors are often entirely krypton-based). Krypton is also capable of much higher light power density than neon in the red spectral line region, and for this reason, red lasers for high-power laser light-shows are often krypton lasers with mirrors which select out the red spectral line for laser amplification and emission, rather than the more familiar helium-neon variety, which could never practically achieve the multi-watt red laser light outputs needed for this application.</p>\n<p>Krypton has an important role in production and usage of the krypton fluoride laser. The laser has been important in the nuclear fusion energy research community in confinement experiments. The laser has high beam uniformity, short wavelength, and the ability to modify the spot size to track an imploding pellet.</p>\n<p>In experimental particle physics, liquid krypton is used to construct quasi-homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeters. A notable example is the calorimeter of the NA48 experiment at CERN containing about 27 tonnes of liquid krypton. This usage is rare, since the cheaper liquid argon is typically used. The advantage of krypton over argon is a small Molière radius of 4.7&nbsp;cm, which allows for excellent spatial resolution and low degree of overlapping. The other parameters relevant for calorimetry application are: radiation length of X=4.7&nbsp;cm, density of 2.4 g/cm.</p>\n<p>The sealed spark gap assemblies contained in ignition exciters used in some older jet engines contain a very small amount of Krypton-85 to obtain consistent ionization levels and uniform operation.</p>\n<p>Krypton-83 has application in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for imaging airways. In particular, it may be used to distinguish between hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces containing an airway.</p>\n<p>Although xenon has potential for use in computed tomography (CT) to assess regional ventilation, its anesthetic properties limit its fraction in the breathing gas to 35%. The use of a breathing mixture containing 30% xenon and 30% krypton is comparable in effectiveness for CT to a 40% xenon fraction, while avoiding the unwanted effects of a high fraction xenon gas.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Krypton is considered to be a non-toxic asphyxiant. Krypton has a narcotic potency seven times greater than air, so breathing a gas containing 50% krypton and 50% air would cause narcosis similar to breathing air at four times atmospheric pressure. This would be comparable to scuba diving at a depth of 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) (see nitrogen narcosis) and potentially could affect anyone breathing it. Nevertheless, that mixture would contain only 10% oxygen and hypoxia would be a greater concern.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Krypton. encyclopedia.airliquide.com</li>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Lide, D.

  "title": "Rubidium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Rubidium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Rb</b> and atomic number 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group, with an atomic mass of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other elements in Group 1, such as very rapid oxidation in air. Rubidium has only one stable isotope, Rb. Another isotope, Rb, which composes almost 28% of naturally occurring rubidium, is slightly radioactive with a half-life of 49&nbsp;billion years—more than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe.</p>\n<p>German chemists Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered rubidium in 1861 by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy.</p>\n<p>Rubidium's compounds have various chemical and electronic applications. Rubidium metal is easily vaporized and has a convenient spectral absorption range, making it a frequent target for laser manipulation of atoms.</p>\n<p>Rubidium is not known to be necessary for any living organisms. However, like caesium, rubidium ions are handled by living organisms in a manner similar to potassium ions, being actively taken up by plants and by animal cells.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Rubidium is a very soft, ductile, silvery-white metal. It is the second most electropositive of the non-radioactive alkali metals and melts at a temperature of 39.3 °C (102.7&nbsp;°F). Similar to other alkali metals, rubidium metal reacts violently with water, forms amalgams with mercury and alloys with gold, iron, caesium, sodium, and potassium, but not lithium (despite the fact that rubidium and lithium are in the same group). As with potassium (which is slightly less reactive) and caesium (which is slightly more reactive), rubidium's reaction with water is usually vigorous enough to ignite the hydrogen gas it liberates. Rubidium has also been reported to ignite spontaneously in air. Rubidium has a very low ionization energy of only 406&nbsp;kJ/mol. Rubidium and potassium show a very similar purple color in the flame test, which makes spectroscopy methods necessary to distinguish the two elements.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>See also category: Rubidium compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRb\n9O\n2 cluster</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Rubidium chloride (RbCl) is probably the most used rubidium compound; it is used in biochemistry to induce cells to take up DNA, and as a biomarker since it is readily taken up to replace potassium, and occurs in only small quantities in living organisms. Other common rubidium compounds are the corrosive rubidium hydroxide (RbOH), the starting material for most rubidium-based chemical processes; rubidium carbonate (RbCO), which is used in some optical glasses, and rubidium copper sulfate, RbSO·CuSO·6HO. Rubidium silver iodide (RbAgI) has the highest room temperature conductivity of any known ionic crystal, a property that is being exploited in thin film batteries and other applications.</p>\n<p>Rubidium has a number of oxides, including rubidium monoxide (RbO), RbO and RbO, which form if rubidium metal is exposed to air; rubidium in excess oxygen gives the superoxide RbO. Rubidium forms salts with halides, making rubidium fluoride, rubidium chloride, rubidium bromide, and rubidium iodide.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of rubidium</div>\n<p>Although rubidium is monoisotopic, naturally occurring rubidium is composed of two isotopes: the stable Rb (72.2%) and the radioactive Rb (27.8%). Natural rubidium is radioactive with specific activity of about 670 Bq/g, enough to significantly expose a photographic film in 110 days. Aside from Rb and Rb, another 24 synthetically produced isotopes or rubidium are known, with half times of under 3&nbsp;months; most of these are highly radioactive and have few uses.</p>\n<p>Rubidium-87 has a half-life of 48.8×10&nbsp;years, which is more than three times the age of the universe of 13.798±0.037×10&nbsp;years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; Rb decays to stable Sr by emission of a negative beta particle. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to become concentrated in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, resulting in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios due to progressing differentiation. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the Sr/Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium-strontium dating).</p>\n<p>Rubidium-82, one of the element's non-natural isotopes, is produced by electron-capture decay of strontium-82 with a half-life of 25.36&nbsp;days. The subsequent decay of rubidium-82 with a half-life of 76 seconds to stable krypton-82 happens by positron emission.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<p>Rubidium is the twenty-third most abundant element in the Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain up to 1% of its oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant amounts.</p>\n<p>Seawater contains an average of 125&nbsp;µg/L of rubidium compared to the much higher value for potassium of 408&nbsp;mg/L and the much lower value of 0.3&nbsp;µg/L for caesium</p>\n<p>Because of its large ionic radius, rubidium is one of the \"incompatible elements.\" During magma crystallization, rubidium is concentrated together with its heavier analogue caesium in the liquid phase and crystallizes last. Therefore the largest deposits of rubidium and caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process. Because rubidium substitutes for potassium in the crystallization of magma, the enrichment is far less effective than in the case of caesium. Zone pegmatite ore bodies containing mineable quantities of caesium as pollucite or the lithium minerals lepidolite are also a source for rubidium as a by-product.</p>\n<p>Two notable sources of rubidium are the rich deposits of pollucite at Bernic Lake, Manitoba, Canada, and the rubicline ((Rb,K)AlSiO) found as impurities in pollucite on the Italian island of Elba, with a rubidium content of 17.5%. Both of these deposits are also sources of caesium.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Although rubidium is more abundant in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO)·12HO yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Two other methods are reported, the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.</p>\n<p>For several years in the 1950s and 1960s, a by-product of potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium, with the rest being potassium and a small fraction of caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, such as the Tanco Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from pollucite.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFlame test for Rubidium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGustav Kirchhoff (left) and Robert Bunsen (center) discovered rubidium spectroscopically. <i>(Henry Enfield Roscoe is on the right side.)</i></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Rubidium was discovered in 1861 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, in Heidelberg, Germany, in the mineral lepidolite through the use of a spectroscope. Because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word <i>rubidus</i>, meaning \"dark red\".</p>\n<p>Rubidium is present as a minor component in lepidolite. Kirchhoff and Bunsen processed 150&nbsp;kg of a lepidolite containing only 0.24% rubidium oxide (RbO). Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid, but these salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water. Therefore, the less-soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate (RbPtCl) could be obtained by fractional crystallization. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen. This process yielded 0.51&nbsp;grams of rubidium chloride for further studies. The first large scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds, performed from 44,000&nbsp;liters of mineral water by Bunsen and Kirchhoff, yielded, besides 7.3&nbsp;grams of caesium chloride, also 9.2&nbsp;grams of rubidium chloride. Rubidium was the second element, shortly after caesium, to be discovered spectroscopically, only one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.</p>\n<p>The two scientists used the rubidium chloride thus obtained to estimate the atomic weight of the new element as 85.36 (the currently accepted value is 85.47). They tried to generate elemental rubidium by electrolysis of molten rubidium chloride, but instead of a metal, they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which \"neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest trace of metallic substance.\" They assigned it as a subchloride (Rb\n2Cl); however, the product was probably a colloidal mixture of the metal and rubidium chloride. In a second attempt to produce metallic rubidium, Bunsen was able to reduce rubidium by heating charred rubidium tartrate. Although the distilled rubidium was pyrophoric, it was possible to determine the density and the melting point of rubidium. The quality of the research done in the 1860s can be appraised by the fact that their determined density differs less than 0.1&nbsp;g/cm and the melting point by less than 1&nbsp;°C from the presently accepted values.</p>\n<p>The slight radioactivity of rubidium was discovered in 1908 but before the theory of isotopes was established in the 1910s and the low activity due to the long half-life of above 10&nbsp;years made interpretation complicated. The now proven decay of Rb to stable Sr through beta decay was still under discussion in the late 1940s.</p>\n<p>Rubidium had minimal industrial value before the 1920s. Since then, the most important use of rubidium has been in research and development, primarily in chemical and electronic applications. In 1995, rubidium-87 was used to produce a Bose–Einstein condensate, for which the discoverers, Eric Allin Cornell, Carl Edwin Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle, won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA rubidium fountain atomic clock at the United States Naval Observatory</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Rubidium compounds are sometimes used in fireworks to give them a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized Rb, is one of the most commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose-Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures.</p>\n<p>Rubidium has been used for polarizing He, producing volumes of magnetized He gas, with the nuclear spins aligned toward a particular direction in space, rather than randomly.</p>\n<p>Rubidium vapor is optically pumped by a laser and the polarized Rb polarizes He through the hyperfine interaction.</p>\n<p>Such spin-polarized He cells are becoming popular for neutron polarization measurements and for producing polarized neutron beams for other purposes.</p>\n<p>The resonant element in atomic clocks utilizes the hyperfine structure of rubidium's energy levels, making rubidium useful for high-precision timing, and is used as the main component of secondary frequency references (rubidium oscillators) to maintain frequency accuracy in cell site transmitters and other electronic transmitting, networking, and test equipment. These rubidium standards are often used with GPS to produce a \"primary frequency standard\" that has greater accuracy and is less expensive than caesium standards. Such rubidium standards are often mass-produced for the telecommunication industry.</p>\n<p>Other potential or current uses of rubidium include a working fluid in vapor turbines, as a getter in vacuum tubes, and as a photocell component. Rubidium is also used as an ingredient in special types of glass, in the production of superoxide by burning in oxygen, in the study of potassium ion channels in biology, and as the vapor to make atomic magnetometers. In particular, Rb is currently being used, with other alkali metals, in the development of spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers.</p>\n<p>Rubidium-82 is used for positron emission tomography. Rubidium is very similar to potassium and therefore tissue with high potassium content will also accumulate the radioactive rubidium. One of the main uses is in myocardial perfusion imaging. The very short half-life of 76&nbsp;seconds makes it necessary to produce the rubidium-82 from decay of strontium-82 close to the patient. As a result of changes in the blood brain barrier in brain tumors, rubidium collects more in brain tumors than normal brain tissue, allowing the use of radioisotope rubidium-82 in nuclear medicine to locate and image brain tumors.</p>\n<p>Rubidium was tested for the influence on manic depression and depression. Dialysis patients suffering from depression show a depletion in rubidium and therefore a supplementation may help during depression. In some tests the rubidium was administered as rubidium chloride with up to 720&nbsp;mg per day for 60 days.</p>\n<h2>Precautions and biological effects</h2>\n<p>Rubidium reacts violently with water and can cause fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or sealed in glass ampoules in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to small amount of air diffusing into oil, and is thus subject to similar peroxide precautions as storage of metallic potassium.</p>\n<p>Rubidium, like sodium and potassium, almost always has +1 oxidation state when dissolved in water, including its presence in all biological systems. The human body tends to treat Rb ions as if they were potassium ions, and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body's intracellular fluid (i.e., inside cells). The ions are not particularly toxic; a 70&nbsp;kg person contains on average 0.36&nbsp;g of rubidium, and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. The biological half-life of rubidium in humans was measured as 31–46&nbsp;days. Although a partial substitution of potassium by rubidium is possible, rats with more than 50% of their potassium substituted in the muscle tissue died.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^   Ohly, Julius (1910). \"Rubidium\".

  "title": "Strontium",
  "html": "<div>For other uses, see Strontium (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Strontium</b> (/ˈstrɒntiəm/ STRON-tee-əm) is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Sr</b> and atomic number&nbsp;38. An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white or yellowish metallic element that is highly reactive chemically. The metal turns yellow when exposed to air. Strontium has physical and chemical properties similar to its two neighbors calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals celestine and strontianite. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic Sr isotope is present in radioactive fallout and has a half-life of 28.90 years.</p>\n<p>Both strontium and strontianite are named after Strontian, a village in Scotland near which the mineral was first discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank. The production of sugar from sugar beet was in the 19th century the largest application. Strontium compounds are today mostly used for the production of cathode ray tubes. The displacement of cathode ray tubes by other display methods in television sets is changing the overall consumption.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOxidized dendritic strontium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Strontium is a grey, silvery metal that is softer than calcium and even more reactive toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380 °C, at room temperature it will only form the oxide spontaneously. Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540 °C.</p>\n<p>Because of its extreme reactivity with oxygen and water, this element occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, such as in the minerals strontianite and celestite. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric meaning it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Natural strontium is a mixture of four stable isotopes.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFlame test for Strontium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Strontium is named after the Scottish village of Strontian (Gaelic <i>Sron an t-Sithein</i>), having been discovered in the ores taken from the lead mines there. In 1790, Adair Crawford, a physician engaged in the preparation of barium, and his colleague William Cruickshank, recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those normally seen in other \"heavy spars\" sources. This allowed Adair to conclude on page 355 \"... it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined.\" The physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer analysed together with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach the mineral from Strontian and named it strontianite. He also came to the conclusion that it was distinct from the witherite and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow proposed the name <i>strontites</i>. He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: \" ... Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. I have called it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion.\" The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide, and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808. In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to <i>strontium</i>.</p>\n<p>The first large scale application of strontium was in the production of sugar from sugar beet. Although a crystallisation process using strontium hydroxide was patented by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1849 the large scale introduction came with the improvement of the process in the early 1870s. The German sugar industry used the process well into the 20th century. Prior to World War I the beet sugar industry used 100,000 to 150,000 tons of strontium hydroxide for this process per year. The strontium hydroxide was recycled in the process, but the demand to substitute losses during production was high enough to create a significant demand initiating mining of strontianite in the Münsterland. The mining of strontianite in Germany ended when mining of the celestite deposits in Gloucestershire started. These mines supplied most of the world strontium supply from 1884 to 1941. Although the celestite deposits in the Granada basin were known for some time the large scale mining did not start before the 1950s.</p>\n<p>During the atmospheric nuclear weapons testing it was observed that strontium-90 is one of the nuclear fission products with a relative high yield. The similarity to calcium and the chance that the strontium-90 might become enriched in bones made research on the metabolism of strontium an important topic.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>See also category: Strontium minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStrontium output in 2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Strontium commonly occurs in nature, the 15th most abundant element on Earth, estimated to average approximately 360&nbsp;parts per million in the Earth's crust and is found chiefly as the form of the sulfate mineral celestite (SrSO) and the carbonate strontianite (SrCO). Of the two, celestite occurs much more frequently in sedimentary deposits of sufficient size to make development of mining facilities attractive. Because strontium is used most often in the carbonate form, strontianite would be the more useful of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development.</p>\n<p>The mean strontium content of ocean water is 8&nbsp;mg/l. At a concentration between 82 and 90 µmol/l of strontium the concentration is considerable lower than the calcium concentration which is normally between 9.6 and 11.6&nbsp;mmol/l.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>According to the British Geological Survey, China was the top producer of strontium in 2007, with over two-thirds world share, followed by Spain, Mexico, Turkey, Argentina, and Iran.</p>\n<p>Large amounts of the mined celestite (SrSO) are converted to the carbonate by two processes. Either the celestite is directly leached with sodium carbonate solution or the celestite is roasted with coal to form the sulfide. The second process results a dark coloured material containing mostly barium sulfide. This so-called black ash is dissolved in water and filtered. Barium carbonate is precipitated from the barium sulfide solution by introduction of carbon dioxide. The sulfate is reduced to the sulfide by the carbothermic reduction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>SrSO + C → SrS + 2 CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>About 300,000 tons are processed in this way annually.</p>\n<p>The metal is produced commercially by reducing strontium oxide with aluminium. The strontium is distilled from the mixture. Strontium metal can in principle be prepared by electrolysis of a solution of strontium chloride in molten potassium chloride:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Sr + 2 e− → Sr</dd>\n<dd>2 Cl → Cl + 2 e−</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of strontium</div>\n<p>Strontium has four stable, naturally occurring isotopes: Sr (0.56%), Sr (9.86%), Sr (7.0%) and Sr (82.58%). Only Sr is radiogenic; it is produced by decay from the radioactive alkali metal Rb, which has a half-life of 4.88 × 10 years. Thus, there are two sources of Sr in any material: first the portion formed in stars along with the isotopes Sr, Sr, and Sr; and second the portion formed by radioactive decay of Rb. The ratio Sr/Sr is the parameter typically reported in geologic investigations; ratios in minerals and rocks have values ranging from about 0.7 to greater than 4.0. Because strontium has an atomic radius similar to that of calcium, it readily substitutes for Ca in minerals.</p>\n<p>Sixteen unstable isotopes are known to exist. Of greatest importance are Sr with a half-life of 28.78 years and Sr with a half-life of 50.5 days. Sr is a by-product of nuclear fission found in nuclear fallout and presents a health problem since it substitutes for calcium in bone, preventing expulsion from the body. This isotope is one of the best long-lived high-energy beta emitters known, and is used in SNAP (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) devices. These devices hold promise for use in spacecraft, remote weather stations, navigational buoys, etc., where a lightweight, long-lived, nuclear-electric power source is required. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated a vast area with Sr. Sr confined inside a concave silver plaque is also used for the medical treatment of a resected pterygium.</p>\n<p>Sr is a short-lived artificial radioisotope that is used in the treatment of bone cancer. In circumstances where cancer patients have widespread and painful bony metastases (secondaries), the administration of Sr results in the delivery of radioactive emissions (beta particles in this case) directly to the area of bony problem (where calcium turnover is greatest). The Sr is manufactured as the chloride salt (which is soluble), and when dissolved in normal saline can be injected intravenously. Typically, cancer patients will be treated with a dose of 150 MBq. Patients must take precautions following this because their urine becomes contaminated with radioactivity, so they must sit to urinate and double-flush the toilet. The beta particles travel about 3.5&nbsp;mm in bone (energy 0.583 MeV) and 6.5&nbsp;mm in tissue, so there is no requirement to isolate patients having been treated, except to say they should not have any one (especially young children) sitting in their laps for 10–40 days. The variation in time results from the variable clearing time for Sr, which depends on renal function and the number of bony metastases. With a lot of bony metastases, the entire Sr dose can be taken up into bone and so the radioactivity is retained to decay over a 50.5-day half-life. It takes about 10 half-lives or about 500 days for 99.9% of the radioactive strontium to decay. However, where there are few bony metastases, the large proportion of Sr not taken up by the bone will be filtered by the kidney, so that the effective half-life (a combination of the physical and biological half-life) will be much shorter.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCRT computer monitor front panel made from strontium and barium oxide-containing glass. This application consumes most of the world's production of strontium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Consuming 75% of production, the primary use for strontium is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes. It prevents X-ray emission. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to the interaction of the X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel has to use a different glass mixture, in which strontium and barium are the X-ray-absorbing materials. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide. The amount of strontium used for the production of cathode ray tube is declining because the CRTs are replaced by other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium.</p>\n<p>Because strontium is so similar to calcium, it is incorporated in the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly similar proportions, as they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns as well as the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites. Strontium, thus, helps forensic scientists too.</p>\n<p>Sr/Sr ratios are commonly used to determine the likely provenance areas of sediment in natural systems, especially in marine and fluvial environments. Dasch (1969) showed that surface sediments of Atlantic displayed Sr/Sr ratios that could be regarded as bulk averages of the Sr/Sr ratios of geological terranes from adjacent landmasses. A good example of a fluvial-marine system to which Sr isotope provenance studies have been successfully employed is the River Nile-Mediterranean system, Due to the differing ages of the rocks that constitute the majority of the Blue and White Nile, catchment areas of the changing provenance of sediment reaching the River Nile delta and East Mediterranean Sea can be discerned through Sr isotopic studies. Such changes are climatically controlled in the Late Quaternary.</p>\n<p>More recently, Sr/Sr ratios have also been used to determine the source of ancient archaeological materials such as timbers and corn in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. Sr/Sr ratios in teeth may also be used to track animal migrations or in criminal forensics.</p>\n<h3>Pyrotechnics</h3>\n<p>Strontium carbonate or other strontium salts are used in the manufacture of fireworks, as they impart a deep red color to the firework. This application consumes about 5% of the world's production.</p>\n<h3>Uses for radioactive strontium</h3>\n<p>Sr is the active ingredient in Metastron (the generic version of Metastron, Generic Strontium Chloride Sr-89 Injection, its manufactured by Bio-Nucleonics Inc.), a radiopharmaceutical used for bone pain secondary to metastatic bone cancer. The strontium acts like calcium and is preferentially incorporated into bone at sites of increased osteogenesis. This localization focuses the radiation exposure on the cancerous lesion.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRTGs from Soviet era lighthouses</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Sr has been used as a power source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Sr produces about 0.93 watts of heat per gram (it is lower for the form of Sr used in RTGs, which is strontium fluoride). However, Sr has a lifetime approximately 3 times shorter and has a lower density than Pu, another RTG fuel. The main advantage of Sr is that it is cheaper than Pu and is found in nuclear waste. Soviet Union deployed nearly 1000 of these RTGs on the northern coast as power source for lighthouses and meteorology stations.</p>\n<p>Sr is also used in cancer therapy. Its beta emission and long half-life is ideal for superficial radiotherapy.</p>\n<h3>Niche applications</h3>\n<p>Strontium chloride is sometimes used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth. One popular brand includes 10% total strontium chloride hexahydrate by weight.</p>\n<p>Small amounts are used in the refining of zinc, to remove small amounts of lead impurities.</p>\n<h3>Research trends</h3>\n<p>Other possible applications follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strontium titanate has an extremely high refractive index and an optical dispersion greater than that of diamond, making it useful in a variety of optics applications. This quality has also led to its being cut into gemstones, in particular as a diamond simulant. However, it is very soft and easily scratches so it is rarely used.</li>\n<li>Ferrite magnets.</li>\n<li>Strontium aluminate is used as a bright phosphor with long persistence of phosphorescence.</li>\n<li>Strontium oxide is sometimes used to improve the quality of some pottery glazes.</li>\n<li>Strontium ranelate is used in the treatment of osteoporosis. It is a prescription drug in the EU, but not in the USA.</li>\n<li>Strontium barium niobate can be used in outdoors holographic 3D displays as a \"screen\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strontium metal is used in strontium 90%-aluminium 10% alloys of an eutectic composition for the modification of aluminium-silicon casting alloys. AJ62, a durable, creep-resistant magnesium alloy used in car and motorcycle engines by BMW, contains 2% strontium by weight.</p>\n<p>Strontium is used in scientific studies of neurotransmitter release in neurons. Like calcium, strontium facilitates synaptic vesicle fusion with the synaptic membrane. But, unlike calcium, strontium causes asynchronous vesicle fusion. Therefore, replacing calcium in a culture medium with strontium allows scientists to measure the effects of a single-vesicle fusion event, e.g., the size of the postsynaptic response elicited by the neurotransmitter content of a single vesicle.</p>\n<p>The important concept for isotopic tracing is that Sr derived from any mineral through weathering reactions will have the same Sr/Sr as the mineral. Therefore, differences in Sr/Sr among ground waters require either (a) differences in mineralogy along contrasting flowpaths or (b) differences in the relative amounts of Sr weathered from the same suite of minerals. This latter situation can arise in several ways. First, differences in initial water chemistry within a homogeneous rock unit will affect the relative weathering rates of the minerals. For example, sections of the soil zone affected by evaporative concentration of recharge waters or by differences in pCO can be expected to have different Sr/Sr. Secondly, differences in the relative mobilities of water at scales ranging from inter-grain pores to the catchment scale may also profoundly affect Sr/Sr (Bullen et al., 1996). For example, the chemical composition and the resultant Sr/Sr in immobile waters at a plagioclase-hornblende grain boundary versus a quartz-mica boundary will be different. Third, a difference in the relative \"effective\" surface areas of minerals in one portion of the rock unit will also cause differences in chemistry and isotopic composition; \"poisoning\" of reactive surfaces by organic coatings is an example of this kind of process. In a fundamental sense, because the waters in shallow systems are not in chemical equilibrium with the rocks, it is unrealistic to expect that waters along flowpaths within even a constant-mineralogy unit should have a constant Sr/Sr. Instead, the waters moving along specific flowpaths slowly react with the rocks and gradually approach chemical equilibrium over long time-periods.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe mineral celestine (SrSO) illustrates the fact that most Sr compounds are colourless or white.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Category:Strontium compounds</div>\n<p>Strontium forms a variety of salts, the properties of which are always intermediate between those of barium and calcium. The salts tend to be colourless. The sulfate and carbonate are poorly soluble, hence their occurrence as minerals. Most compounds are derived from the carbonate or the sulfide, which is obtained from the minerals. Typical for an alkaline earth derivative, the sulfide hydrolyzes readily:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>SrS + 2 HO → Sr(OH) + HS</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Similar reactions are used in the production of commercially useful compounds, including the most useful strontium compound, strontium carbonate.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>SrS + HO + CO → SrCO + HS</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Strontium nitrate can also be prepared in this way.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Acantharea a relative large group of marine radiolarian protozoa produce intricate mineral skeletons composed of strontium sulfate. In biological systems calcium is substituted in a small extent by strontium. In the human body most of the absorbed strontium is deposited in the bones. The ratio of strontium to calcium in human bones is between 1:1000 and 1:2000 roughly in the same range like in the blood serum.</p>\n<h3>Effect on the human body</h3>\n<p>The human body absorbs strontium as if it were calcium. Due to the chemical similarity of the elements, the stable forms of strontium might not pose a significant health threat — in fact, the levels found naturally may actually be beneficial (see below) – but the radioactive Sr can lead to various bone disorders and diseases, including bone cancer. The strontium unit is used in measuring radioactivity from absorbed Sr.</p>\n<p>A recent in-vitro study conducted the NY College of Dental Sciences using strontium on osteoblasts showed marked improvement on bone-building osteoblasts.</p>\n<p>The drug strontium ranelate, made by combining strontium with ranelic acid, was found to aid bone growth, increase bone density, and lessen vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. Women receiving the drug showed a 12.7% increase in bone density. Women receiving a placebo had a 1.6% decrease. Half the increase in bone density (measured by X-ray densitometry) is attributed to the higher atomic weight of Sr compared with calcium, whereas the other half a true increase in bone mass. Strontium ranelate is registered as a prescription drug in Europe and many countries worldwide. It must be prescribed by a doctor, must be delivered by a pharmacist, and requires strict medical supervision.</p>\n<p>There is a long history of medical research regarding strontium's benefits, beginning in the 1950s. Studies indicate a lack of undesirable side-effects. Several other salts of strontium such as strontium citrate and strontium carbonate are available in the United States under the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act of 1994, providing close to the recommended strontium content, about 680 milligrams per day, of strontium ranelate. Their long-term safety and efficacy have not been evaluated on humans in large-scale medical trials. However, some companies do manufacture strontium pills for increasing bone health.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ P. Colarusso et al.

  "title": "Yttrium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with ytterbium.</div>\n\n<p><b>Yttrium</b> is a chemical element with symbol <b>Y</b> and atomic number 39. It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a \"rare earth element\". Yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element. Its only stable isotope, Y, is also its only naturally occurring isotope.</p>\n<p>In 1787, Carl Axel Arrhenius found a new mineral near Ytterby in Sweden and named it <i>ytterbite</i>, after the village. Johan Gadolin discovered yttrium's oxide in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and Anders Gustaf Ekeberg named the new oxide <i>yttria</i>. Elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by Friedrich Wöhler.</p>\n<p>The most important use of yttrium is in making phosphors, such as the red ones used in television set cathode ray tube (CRT) displays and in LEDs. Other uses include the production of electrodes, electrolytes, electronic filters, lasers and superconductors; various medical applications; and as traces in various materials to enhance their properties. Yttrium has no known biological role, and exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Properties</h3>\n<p>Yttrium is a soft, silver-metallic, lustrous and highly crystalline transition metal in group 3. As expected by periodic trends, it is less electronegative than its predecessor in the group, scandium, more electronegative than its successor in the group, lanthanum, and less electronegative than the next member of period 5, zirconium. Yttrium is the first d-block element in the fifth period.</p>\n<p>The pure element is relatively stable in air in bulk form, due to passivation resulting from the formation of a protective oxide (Y\n2O\n3) film on its surface. This film can reach a thickness of 10&nbsp;µm when yttrium is heated to 750&nbsp;°C in water vapor. When finely divided, however, yttrium is very unstable in air; shavings or turnings of the metal can ignite in air at temperatures exceeding 400&nbsp;°C. Yttrium nitride (YN) is formed when the metal is heated to 1000&nbsp;°C in nitrogen.</p>\n<h3>Similarity to the lanthanides</h3>\n<div>For more details on this topic, see Rare earth element.</div>\n<p>The similarities of yttrium to the lanthanides are so strong that the element has historically been grouped with them as a rare earth element, and is always found in nature together with them in rare earth minerals.</p>\n<p>Chemically, yttrium resembles these elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, scandium, and if its physical properties were plotted against atomic number then it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanides gadolinium and erbium.</p>\n<p>It often also falls in the same range for reaction order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'Yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves as if it were one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.</p>\n<p>One of the few notable differences between the chemistry of yttrium and that of the lanthanides is that yttrium is almost exclusively trivalent, whereas about half of the lanthanides can have valences other than three.</p>\n<h3>Compounds and reactions</h3>\n<div>See also category: Yttrium compounds</div>\n<p>As a trivalent transition metal, yttrium forms various inorganic compounds, generally in the oxidation state of +3, by giving up all three of its valence electrons. A good example is yttrium(III) oxide (Y\n2O\n3), also known as yttria, a six-coordinate white solid.</p>\n<p>Yttrium forms a water-insoluble fluoride, hydroxide, and oxalate, but its bromide, chloride, iodide, nitrate and sulfate are all soluble in water. The Y ion is colorless in solution because of the absence of electrons in the d and f electron shells.</p>\n<p>Water readily reacts with yttrium and its compounds to form Y\n2O\n3. Concentrated nitric and hydrofluoric acids do not rapidly attack yttrium, but other strong acids do.</p>\n<p>With halogens, yttrium forms trihalides such as yttrium(III) fluoride (YF\n3), yttrium(III) chloride (YCl\n3), and yttrium(III) bromide (YBr\n3) at temperatures above roughly 200&nbsp;°C. Similarly, carbon, phosphorus, selenium, silicon and sulfur all form binary compounds with yttrium at elevated temperatures.</p>\n<p>Organoyttrium chemistry is the study of compounds containing carbon–yttrium bonds. A few of these are known to have yttrium in the oxidation state 0. (The +2 state has been observed in chloride melts, and +1 in oxide clusters in the gas phase.) Some trimerization reactions were observed by using organoyttrium compounds as catalysts. These compounds use YCl\n3 as a starting material, which in turn is obtained from Y\n2O\n3 and concentrated hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride.</p>\n<p>Hapticity is how a group of contiguous atoms of a ligand are coordinated to a central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character <i>eta</i>, η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands were bound to a d-metal center through a η-hapticity. Vaporization of the graphite intercalation compounds graphite–Y or graphite–Y\n2O\n3 leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as Y@C. Electron spin resonance studies indicated the formation of Y and (C) ion pairs. The carbides YC, YC, and YC can each hydrolyze to form hydrocarbons.</p>\n<h3>Nucleosynthesis and isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of yttrium</div>\n<p>Yttrium in the Solar System was created through stellar nucleosynthesis, mostly by the s-process (≈72%), but also by the r-process (≈28%). The r-process consists of rapid neutron capture of lighter elements during supernova explosions. The s-process is a slow neutron capture of lighter elements inside pulsating red giant stars.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMira is an example of the type of red giant star where most of the yttrium in the solar system was created.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Yttrium isotopes are among the most common products of the nuclear fission of uranium occurring in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In terms of nuclear waste management, the most important isotopes of yttrium are Y and Y, with half-lives of 58.51&nbsp;days and 64&nbsp;hours, respectively. Though Y has the short half-life, it exists in secular equilibrium with its long-lived parent isotope, strontium-90 (Sr) with a half-life of 29&nbsp;years.</p>\n<p>All group three elements have an odd atomic number, and therefore they have few stable isotopes. Scandium has one stable isotope, and yttrium itself has only one stable isotope, Y, which is also its only naturally occurring one. However, the lanthanide rare earths contain elements of even atomic number and many stable isotopes. Yttrium-89 is thought to be more abundant than it otherwise would be, due in part to the s-process, which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by electron emission (neutron → proton). Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with atomic mass numbers (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable atomic nuclei with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively. Y has a mass number close to 90 and has 50 neutrons in its nucleus.</p>\n<p>At least 32 synthetic isotopes of yttrium have been observed, and these range in atomic mass number from 76 to 108. The least stable of these is Y with a half-life of &gt;150&nbsp;ns (Y has a half-life of &gt;200&nbsp;ns) and the most stable is Y with a half-life of 106.626&nbsp;days. Besides the isotopes Y, Y, and Y, with half-lives of 58.51&nbsp;days, 79.8&nbsp;hours, and 64&nbsp;hours, respectively, all the other isotopes have half-lives of less than a day and most of those have half-lives of less than an hour.</p>\n<p>Yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or below 88 decay primarily by positron emission (proton → neutron) to form strontium (Z = 38) isotopes. Yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or above 90 decay primarily by electron emission (neutron → proton) to form zirconium (Z = 40) isotopes. Isotopes with mass numbers at or above 97 are also known to have minor decay paths of β− delayed neutron emission.</p>\n<p>Yttrium has at least 20 metastable or excited isomers ranging in mass number from 78 to 102. Multiple excitation states have been observed for Y and Y. While most of yttrium's isomers are expected to be less stable than their ground state, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, and Y have longer half-lives than their ground states, as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than isomeric transition.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>In 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a heavy black rock in an old quarry near the Swedish village of Ytterby (now part of the Stockholm Archipelago). Thinking that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten, he named it <i>ytterbite</i> and sent samples to various chemists for further analysis.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nJohan Gadolin discovered yttrium oxide.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Johan Gadolin at the University of Åbo identified a new oxide or \"earth\" in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794. Anders Gustaf Ekeberg confirmed this in 1797 and named the new oxide <i>yttria</i>. In the decades after Antoine Lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements, it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been <i>yttrium</i>.</p>\n<p>In 1843, Carl Gustaf Mosander found that samples of yttria contained three oxides: white yttrium oxide (yttria), yellow terbium oxide (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored erbium oxide (called 'terbia' at the time). A fourth oxide, ytterbium oxide, was isolated in 1878 by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac. New elements would later be isolated from each of those oxides, and each element was named, in some fashion, after Ytterby, the village near the quarry where they were found (see ytterbium, terbium, and erbium). In the following decades, seven other new metals were discovered in \"Gadolin's yttria\". Since yttria was a mineral after all and not an oxide, Martin Heinrich Klaproth renamed it gadolinite in honor of Gadolin.</p>\n<p>Yttrium metal was first isolated in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler heated anhydrous yttrium(III) chloride with potassium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>YCl + 3 K → 3 KCl + Y</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Until the early 1920s, the chemical symbol <b>Yt</b> was used for the element, after which <b>Y</b> came into common use.</p>\n<p>In 1987, yttrium barium copper oxide was found to achieve high-temperature superconductivity. It was only the second material known to exhibit this property, and it was the first known material to achieve superconductivity above the (economically important) boiling point of nitrogen.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nXenotime crystals contain yttrium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Abundance</h3>\n<p>Yttrium is found in most rare earth minerals, as well as some uranium ores, but is never found in nature as a free element. About 31&nbsp;ppm of the Earth's crust is yttrium, making it the 28th most abundant element there, and 400 times more common than silver. Yttrium is found in soil in concentrations between 10 and 150&nbsp;ppm (dry weight average of 23&nbsp;ppm) and in sea water at 9&nbsp;ppt. Lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project have a relatively high content of yttrium.</p>\n<p>Yttrium has no known biological role, though it is found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans. There is normally as little as 0.5&nbsp;milligrams found within the entire human body; human breast milk contains 4&nbsp;ppm. Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20&nbsp;ppm and 100&nbsp;ppm (fresh weight), with cabbage having the largest amount. With up to 700&nbsp;ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.</p>\n<h3>Production</h3>\n<p>The chemical similarity of yttrium with the lanthanides leads it to being enriched by the same processes and ends up in ores containing lanthanides, forming rare earth minerals. A slight separation is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare earth elements (HREE) but this separation is never complete. Yttrium is concentrated in the HREE group by virtue of its ionic size even though it has a lower atomic mass.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA piece of yttrium. Yttrium is difficult to separate from other rare earth elements.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>There are four main sources for REEs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carbonate and fluoride containing ores such as the LREE bastnäsite ([(Ce, La, etc.)(CO)F]) contain an average of 0.1% of yttrium compared to the 99.9% for the 16 other REEs. The main source for bastnäsite from the 1960s to the 1990s was the Mountain Pass rare earth mine in California, making the United States the largest producer of REEs during that period.</li>\n<li>Monazite ([(Ce, La, etc.)PO]), which is mostly phosphate, is a placer deposit of sand that is created by the transportation and gravitational separation of eroded granite. Monazite as a LREE ore contains 2% (or 3%) of yttrium. The largest deposits were found in India and Brazil in the early 20th century, making these two countries the largest producers of yttrium in the first half of that century.</li>\n<li>Xenotime, a REE phosphate, is the main HREE ore containing up to 60% of yttrium as yttrium phosphate (YPO). The largest mine for this mineral is the Bayan Obo deposit in China, making China the largest exporter for HREE since the closure of the Mountain Pass mine in the 1990s.</li>\n<li>Ion absorption clays or Lognan clays are the weathering products of granite and contain only 1% of REEs. The final ore concentrate can contain up to 8% of yttrium. Ion absorption clays are mostly mined in southern China. Yttrium is also found in samarskite and fergusonite.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One method to obtain pure yttrium from the mixed oxide ores is to dissolve the oxide in sulfuric acid and fractionate it by ion exchange chromatography. With the addition of oxalic acid, the yttrium oxalate precipitates. The oxalate is converted into the oxide by heating under oxygen. By reacting the resulting yttrium oxide with hydrogen fluoride, yttrium fluoride is obtained. Using quaternary ammonium salts as extractants, yttrium prefers to remain in the aqueous phase: when the counter-ion is nitrate, the light lanthanides are removed, but when the counter-ion is thiocyanate, the heavy lanthanides are removed. Yttrium salts of 99.999% purity are obtained. In the usual situation, where yttrium is two-thirds of a heavy-lanthanide mixture, there is an advantage to getting it out of the system as quickly as possible, to ease the separation of the remaining elements.</p>\n<p>Annual world production of yttrium oxide had reached 600&nbsp;tonnes by 2001, with reserves estimated at 9&nbsp;million&nbsp;tonnes. Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing yttrium fluoride to a metal sponge with calcium magnesium alloy. The temperature of an arc furnace of above 1,600&nbsp;°C is sufficient to melt the yttrium.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Consumer</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nYttrium is one of the elements used to make the red color in CRT televisions.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Yttria (Y\n2O\n3) can serve as host lattice for doping with Eu cations as well as reactant to gain doped yttrium orthovanadate YVO:Eu or yttrium oxide sulfide Y\n2O\n2S:Eu phosphors that give the red color in color television picture tubes, though the red color itself is actually emitted from the europium while the yttrium collects energy from the electron gun and passes it to the phosphor. Yttrium compounds can serve as host lattices for doping with different lanthanide cations. Besides Eu also Tb can be used as a doping agent leading to green luminescence. Yttria is also used as a sintering additive in the production of porous silicon nitride and as a common starting material for both material science and for producing other compounds of yttrium.</p>\n<p>Yttrium compounds are used as a catalyst for ethylene polymerization. As a metal, it is used on the electrodes of some high-performance spark plugs. Yttrium is also used in the manufacturing of gas mantles for propane lanterns as a replacement for thorium, which is radioactive.</p>\n<p>Developing uses include yttrium-stabilized zirconia in particular as a solid electrolyte and as an oxygen sensor in automobile exhaust systems.</p>\n<h3>Garnets</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNd:YAG laser rod 0.5 cm in diameter.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Yttrium is used in the production of a large variety of synthetic garnets, and yttria is used to make yttrium iron garnets (Y\n3Fe\n5O\n12 or YIG), which are very effective microwave filters. Yttrium, iron, aluminium, and gadolinium garnets (e.g. Y(Fe,Al)O and Y(Fe,Ga)O) have important magnetic properties. YIG is also very efficient as an acoustic energy transmitter and transducer. Yttrium aluminium garnet (Y\n3Al\n5O\n12 or YAG) has a hardness of 8.5 and is also used as a gemstone in jewelry (simulated diamond). Cerium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Ce) crystals are used as phosphors to make white LEDs.</p>\n<p>YAG, yttria, yttrium lithium fluoride (LiYF\n4), and yttrium orthovanadate (YVO\n4) are used in combination with dopants such as neodymium, erbium, ytterbium in near-infrared lasers. YAG lasers have the ability to operate at high power and are used for drilling into and cutting metal. The single crystals of doped YAG are normally produced by the Czochralski process.</p>\n<h3>Material enhancer</h3>\n<p>Small amounts of yttrium (0.1 to 0.2%) have been used to reduce the grain sizes of chromium, molybdenum, titanium, and zirconium. It is also used to increase the strength of aluminium and magnesium alloys. The addition of yttrium to alloys generally improves workability, adds resistance to high-temperature recrystallization and significantly enhances resistance to high-temperature oxidation (see graphite nodule discussion below).</p>\n<p>Yttrium can be used to deoxidize vanadium and other non-ferrous metals. Yttria is used to stabilize the cubic form of zirconia for use in jewelry.</p>\n<p>Yttrium has been studied for possible use as a nodulizer in making nodular cast iron, which has increased ductility (the graphite forms compact nodules instead of flakes to form nodular cast iron). Yttrium oxide can also be used in ceramic and glass formulas, since it has a high melting point and imparts shock resistance and low thermal expansion characteristics. It is therefore used in camera lenses.</p>\n<h3>Medical</h3>\n<p>The radioactive isotope yttrium-90 is used in drugs such as Yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide and Yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan for the treatment of various cancers, including lymphoma, leukemia, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, and bone cancers. It works by adhering to monoclonal antibodies, which in turn bind to cancer cells and kill them via intense β-radiation from the yttrium-90 (see Monoclonal antibody therapy).</p>\n<p>Needles made of yttrium-90, which can cut more precisely than scalpels, have been used to sever pain-transmitting nerves in the spinal cord, and yttrium-90 is also used to carry out radionuclide synovectomy in the treatment of inflamed joints, especially knees, in sufferers of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n<p>A neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser has been used in an experimental, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in canines in an attempt to reduce collateral nerve and tissue damage, whilst the erbium-doped ones are starting to be used in cosmetic skin resurfacing.</p>\n<h3>Superconductors</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nYBCO superconductor</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Yttrium was used in the yttrium barium copper oxide (YBaCuO, aka 'YBCO' or '1-2-3') superconductor developed at the University of Alabama and the University of Houston in 1987. This superconductor operated at 93&nbsp;K, notable because this is above liquid nitrogen's boiling point (77.1&nbsp;K). As the price of liquid nitrogen is lower than that of liquid helium, which must be used for the metallic superconductors, the operating costs would decrease.</p>\n<p>The actual superconducting material is often written as YBaCuO, where <i>d</i> must be less than 0.7 for the material to superconduct. The reason for this is still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.</p>\n<p>The theory of low temperature superconductivity has been well understood since the BCS theory was put forward in 1957. It is based on a peculiarity of the interaction between two electrons in a crystal lattice. However, the BCS theory does not explain high temperature superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be precisely controlled if superconductivity is to occur.</p>\n<p>The created material was a black and green, multi-crystal, multi-phase mineral. Researchers are studying a class of materials known as perovskites that are alternative mixtures of these elements, hoping to eventually develop a practical high-temperature superconductor.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Water soluble compounds of yttrium are considered mildly toxic, while its insoluble compounds are non-toxic. In experiments on animals, yttrium and its compounds caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of yttrium citrate caused pulmonary edema and dyspnea, while inhalation of yttrium chloride caused liver edema, pleural effusions, and pulmonary hyperemia.</p>\n<p>Exposure to yttrium compounds in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and upper respiratory tract irritation—though this may have been caused by the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. NIOSH recommends a time-weighted average limit of 1&nbsp;mg/m and an IDLH of 500&nbsp;mg/m. Yttrium dust is flammable.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Essentially, a neutron becomes a proton while an electron and antineutrino are emitted.</li>\n<li>^ See: magic number.

  "title": "Zirconium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with zircon, zirconia, or cubic zirconia.</div>\n\n<p><b>Zirconium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Zr</b>, atomic number 40 and atomic mass of 91.224. The name of zirconium is taken from the mineral zircon, the most important source of zirconium, and from the Arabic word \"zargun\", meaning \"gold colored\". It is a lustrous, grey-white, strong transition metal that resembles titanium. Zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier, although it is used in small amounts as an alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion. Zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride, respectively. Five isotopes occur naturally, three of which are stable. Zirconium compounds have no known biological role.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Zirconium is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile and malleable metal which is solid at room temperature, though it becomes hard and brittle at lower purities. In powder form, zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form is far less prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc become magnetic below 35&nbsp;K.</p>\n<p>Zirconium's melting point is 1855 °C (3371 °F), and its boiling point is 4371 °C (7900 °F). Zirconium has an electronegativity of 1.33 on the Pauling scale. Of the elements within d-block, zirconium has the fourth lowest electronegativity after yttrium, lutetium and hafnium.</p>\n<p>At room temperature zirconium exhibits a hexagonally close packed crystal structure, α-Zr, which changes to β-Zr a body-centered cubic crystal structure at 863 °C. Zirconium exists in the β-phase until the melting point.</p>\n<p>ZrZn is one of only two substances to exhibit superconductivity and ferromagnetism simultaneously, with the other being UGe.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA zirconium rod</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of zirconium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring zirconium is composed of five isotopes. Zr, Zr, Zr and Zr are stable. Zr can undergo double beta decay (not observed experimentally) with a half-life of more than 1.10×10&nbsp;years. Zr has a half-life of 2.4×10&nbsp;years, making it the longest-lived radioisotope of zirconium. Of these natural isotopes, Zr is the most common, making up 51.45% of all zirconium. Zr is the least common, comprising only 2.80% of zirconium.</p>\n<p>Twenty-eight artificial isotopes of zirconium have been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 78 to 110. Zr is the longest-lived artificial isotope, with a half-life of 1.53×10&nbsp;years. Zr, the heaviest isotope of zirconium, is also the shortest-lived, with an estimated half-life of only 30&nbsp;milliseconds. Radioactive isotopes at or above mass number 93 decay by β, whereas those at or below 89 decay by β. The only exception is Zr, which decays by ε.</p>\n<p>Five isotopes of zirconium also exist as metastable isomers: Zr, Zr, Zr, Zr, Zr and Zr. Of these, Zr has the shortest half-life at 131&nbsp;nanoseconds. Zr is the longest lived with a half-life of 4.161&nbsp;minutes.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also category: Zirconium minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld production trend of zirconium mineral concentrates</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Zirconium has a concentration of about 130&nbsp;mg/kg within the Earth's crust and about 0.026&nbsp;μg/L in sea water. It is not found in nature as a native metal, reflecting its intrinsic instability with respect to water. The principal commercial source of zirconium is the silicate mineral, zircon (ZrSiO), which is found primarily in Australia, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa and the United States, as well as in smaller deposits around the world. 80% of zircon mining occurs in Australia and South Africa. Zircon resources exceed 60 million tonnes worldwide and annual worldwide zirconium production is approximately 900,000 tonnes. Zirconium also occurs in more than 140 other minerals, including the commercially useful ores baddeleyite and kosnarite.</p>\n<p>Zr is relatively abundant in S-type stars, and it has been detected in the sun and in meteorites. Lunar rock samples brought back from several Apollo program missions to the moon have a quite high zirconium oxide content relative to terrestrial rocks.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nZirconium output in 2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Zirconium is a by-product of the mining and processing of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile, as well as tin mining. From 2003 to 2007, zircon prices have steadily increased from $360 to $840 per tonne.</p>\n<p>Upon being collected from coastal waters, zircon-containing sand is purified by spiral concentrators to remove lighter materials, which are then placed back into the water safely, as they are all natural components of beach sand. Using magnetic separation, the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile are removed.</p>\n<p>Most zircon is used directly in commercial applications, but a few percent is converted to the metal. Most Zr metal is produced by the reduction of the zirconium(IV) chloride with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. Commercial-quality zirconium for most uses still has a content of 1% to 3% hafnium. This contaminant is unimportant except in nuclear applications. The resulting metal is sintered until sufficiently ductile for metalworking.</p>\n<h3>Separation of zirconium and hafnium</h3>\n<p>Commercial zirconium metal typically contains 1–2.5% of hafnium, which is not problematic because the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are rather similar. Their neutron-absorbing properties differ strongly, however, necessitating the separation of hafnium from zirconium for applications involving nuclear reactors. Several separation schemes are in use. The liquid-liquid extraction of the thiocyanate-oxide derivatives, exploits the slightly greater solubility of the hafnium derivative in methyl isobutyl ketone vs water. This method is used mainly in United States. Zr and Hf can also be separated by fractional crystallization of potassium hexafluorozirconate (KZrF), which is less soluble in water than the analogous hafnium derivative. Fractional distillation of the tetrachlorides, also called extractive distillation, is used primarily in Europe. A quadruple VAM (vacuum arc melting) process, combined with hot extruding and different rolling applications is cured using high-pressure high-temperature gas autoclaving, resulting in reactor-grade zirconium that is about 10 times more expensive than the hafnium-contaminated commercial grade. The separated hafnium can be used for control rods of the reactor. The separation of hafnium is especially important for nuclear applications since Hf has very high neutron absorption cross-section, 600 times higher than zirconium, and therefore has to be removed for reactor applications.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also categories: Zirconium compounds&nbsp;and Zirconium minerals</div>\n<p>Like other transition metals, zirconium forms a wide range of inorganic compounds and coordination complexes. In general, these compounds are colourless diamagnetic solids wherein Zr has the oxidation state IV+. Far fewer Zr(III) compounds are known, and Zr(II) is very rare.</p>\n<h3>Oxides, nitrides and carbides</h3>\n<p>The most common oxide is zirconium dioxide, ZrO, also referred to as <i>zirconia</i>. This colourless solid has exceptional fracture toughness and chemical resistance, especially in its cubic form. These properties make zirconia useful as a thermal barrier coating, although it is also a common diamond substitute. Zirconium tungstate is an unusual substance in that it shrinks in all directions when heated, whereas most other substances expand when heated. Zirconyl chloride is a rare water-soluble zirconium complex, it has the relatively complicated formula [Zr(OH)(HO)]Cl.</p>\n<p>Zirconium carbide and zirconium nitride are refractory solids. The carbide is used to make drilling tools and cutting edges. Zirconium(II) hydride is also known.</p>\n<h3>Halides and pseudohalides</h3>\n<p>All four common halides are known, ZrF, ZrCl, ZrBr, ZrI. All have polymeric structures and are far less volatile than the corresponding monomeric titanium tetrahalides. All tend to hydrolyse to give the so-called oxyhalides and dioxides. The corresponding tetraalkoxides are also known. Unlike the halides, the alkoxides dissolve in nonpolar solvents.</p>\n<h3>Organic derivatives</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nZirconocene dichloride, a representative organozirconium compound.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Organozirconium chemistry is the study of compounds containing a carbon-zirconium bond. The first such compound was zirconocene dibromide ((CH)ZrBr), reported in 1952 by Birmingham and Wilkinson. Schwartz's reagent, prepared in 1970 by P. C. Wailes and H. Weigold, is a metallocene used in organic synthesis for transformations of alkenes and alkynes. Zirconium is also a component of some Ziegler-Natta catalysts, used to produce polypropylene. This application exploits the ability of zirconium to reversibly form bonds to carbon. Most complexes of Zr(II) are derivatives of zirconacene, one example being (CMe)Zr(CO).</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The zirconium-containing mineral zircon and related minerals (jargoon, hyacinth, jacinth, ligure) were mentioned in biblical writings. The mineral was not known to contain a new element until 1789, when Klaproth analyzed a jargoon from the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He named the new element Zirkonerde (zirconia). Humphry Davy attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis, but failed. Zirconium metal was first obtained in an impure form in 1824 by Berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube.</p>\n<p>The <i>crystal bar process</i> (also known as the <i>Iodide Process</i>), discovered by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925, was the first industrial process for the commercial production of metallic zirconium. The process involves the formation and subsequent thermal decomposition of zirconium tetraiodide. This method was superseded in 1945 by the much cheaper Kroll process developed by William Justin Kroll, in which zirconium tetrachloride is reduced by magnesium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>ZrCl + 2 Mg → Zr + 2 MgCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Approximately 900,000 tonnes of Zr ores were produced commercially in 1995, mostly as zircon.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<p>The great majority of zircon is used directly in a variety of high temperature applications. This material is refractory and hard, as well as resistant to chemical attack. Because of these properties, zircon finds many applications, few of which are highly publicized. Its main use is as an opacifier, conferring a white, opaque appearance to ceramic materials. Because of its chemical resistance, zircon is also used in aggressive environments, such as moulds for molten metals. Zirconium dioxide (ZrO) is used in laboratory crucibles, metallurgical furnaces, as a refractory material, and it can be sintered into a ceramic knife. Zircon (ZrSiO) is cut into gemstones for use in jewellery.</p>\n<h3>Metal</h3>\n<p>A small fraction of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium toward oxygen, apparent only at high temperatures, is the basis of some specialised applications as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same behavior is probably the basis of the use of Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb for incendiary effect.</p>\n<h4>Nuclear applications</h4>\n<p>Cladding for nuclear reactor fuels consumes about 1% of the zirconium supply. For this purpose, it is mainly used in the form of zircaloys. The benefits of Zr alloys is their low neutron-capture cross-section and good resistance to corrosion under normal service conditions. The development of efficient methods for the separation of zirconium from hafnium was required for this application.</p>\n<p>One disadvantage of zirconium alloys is their reactivity toward water at high temperatures leading to the formation of hydrogen gas and to the accelerated degradation of the fuel rod cladding:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Zr + 2 HO → ZrO + 2 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This exothermic reaction is very slow below 100 °C, but at temperature above 900 °C the reaction is rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but then, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactors cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting of hydrogen in the maintenance hall of these three reactors, the explosive mixture of hydrogen with air oxygen detonated, severely damaging the installations and at least one of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed to rapidly convert hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the explosivity limit is reached.</p>\n<h4>Space and aeronautic industries</h4>\n<p>Materials fabricated from zirconium metal and its oxide (ZrO) are used in space vehicle parts for their resistance to heat. Zirconia is also a component in some abrasives, such as grinding wheels and sandpaper.</p>\n<p>High temperature parts such as combustors, blades and vanes in jet engines and stationary gas turbines are to an increasing extent being protected by thin ceramic layers. These ceramic layers are usually composed by a mixture of zirconia and yttria.</p>\n<h3>Positron emission tomography cameras</h3>\n<p>The isotope Zr has been recently applied to the tracking and quantification of molecular antibodies with positron emission tomography (PET) cameras (a method called \"immuno-PET\"). Immuno-PET has reached maturity in terms of technical development and is now entering the phase of wide-scale clinical applications. Until recently, radiolabeling with Zr was a complicated procedure requiring multiple steps. In 2001–2003 an improved multistep procedure was developed using a succinylated derivative of desferrioxamine B (N-sucDf) as a bifunctional chelate, and a better way of binding Zr to mAbs was reported in 2009. The new method is fast, consists of only two steps, and uses two widely available ingredients: Zr and the appropriate chelate.</p>\n<h3>Defunct applications</h3>\n<p>Zirconium carbonate (3ZrO·CO·HO) was used in lotions to treat poison ivy but was discontinued because it occasionally caused skin reactions.</p>\n<h2>Safety</h2>\n<p>Zirconium has no known biological role, and zirconium compounds are of low toxicity. The human body contains, on average, only 1&nbsp;milligram of zirconium, and daily intake is approximately 50&nbsp;μg per day. Zirconium content in human blood is as low as 10 parts per billion. Aquatic plants readily take up soluble zirconium, but it is rare in land plants. Seventy percent of plants have no detectable zirconium content, and those that do have as little as 5 parts per billion.</p>\n<p>Short-term exposure to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention. Inhalation of zirconium compounds can cause skin and lung granulomas. Zirconium aerosols can cause pulmonary granulomas. Persistent exposure to zirconium tetrachloride resulted in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cell in dogs. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends a 5&nbsp;mg/m time weighted average limit and a 10&nbsp;mg/m short-term exposure limit for air dust.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Zirconium alloys</li>\n<li>Zirconia light</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ \"Zirconium: zirconium(I) fluoride compound data\".

  "title": "Niobium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Niobium</b>, formerly <b>columbium</b>, is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Nb</b> (formerly <b>Cb</b>) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and columbite. The name comes from Greek mythology: <i>Niobe</i>, daughter of <i>Tantalus</i>.</p>\n<p>Niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum, and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish. The English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949.</p>\n<p>It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading producer of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines. Although alloys contain only a maximum of 0.1%, that small percentage of niobium improves the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines. Niobium is used in various superconducting materials. These superconducting alloys, also containing titanium and tin, are widely used in the superconducting magnets of MRI scanners. Other applications of niobium include its use in welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, numismatics and jewelry. In the last two applications, niobium's low toxicity and ability to be colored by anodization are particular advantages.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCharles Hatchett was the discoverer of <i>columbium</i>.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPicture of a Hellenistic sculpture representing <i>Niobe</i> by Giorgio Sommer</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Niobium was discovered by the English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801. He found a new element in a mineral sample that had been sent to England from Massachusetts, United States in 1734 by John Winthrop F.R.S. (grandson of John Winthrop the Younger) and named the mineral <i>columbite</i> and the new element <i>columbium</i> after <i>Columbia</i>, the poetical name for America. The <i>columbium</i> discovered by Hatchett was probably a mixture of the new element with tantalum.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, there was considerable confusion over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918&nbsp;g/cm, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8&nbsp;g/cm, and concluded that the two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: <i>niobium</i> (from Niobe), and <i>pelopium</i> (from Pelops). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements <i>pelopium</i>, <i>ilmenium</i> and <i>dianium</i> were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.</p>\n<p>The differences between tantalum and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, as well as Louis J. Troost, who determined the formulas of some of the compounds in 1865 and finally by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866, who all proved that there were only two elements. Articles on <i>ilmenium</i> continued to appear until 1871.</p>\n<p>De Marignac was the first to prepare the metal in 1864, when he reduced niobium chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Although de Marignac was able to produce tantalum-free niobium on a larger scale by 1866, it was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially, in incandescent lamp filaments. This use quickly became obsolete through the replacement of niobium with tungsten, which has a higher melting point and thus is preferable for use in incandescent lamps. The discovery that niobium improves the strength of steel was made in the 1920s, and this application remains its predominant use. In 1961 the American physicist Eugene Kunzler and coworkers at Bell Labs discovered that niobium-tin continues to exhibit superconductivity in the presence of strong electric currents and magnetic fields, making it the first material to support the high currents and fields necessary for useful high-power magnets and electrically powered machinery. This discovery would allow — two decades later — the production of long multi-strand cables that could be wound into coils to create large, powerful electromagnets for rotating machinery, particle accelerators, or particle detectors.</p>\n<h3>Naming of the element</h3>\n<p><i>Columbium</i> (symbol <i>Cb</i>) was the name originally given to this element by Hatchett, and this name remained in use in American journals—the last paper published by American Chemical Society with columbium in its title dates from 1953—while <i>niobium</i> was used in Europe. To end this confusion, the name <i>niobium</i> was chosen for element 41 at the 15th Conference of the Union of Chemistry in Amsterdam in 1949. A year later this name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) after 100 years of controversy, despite the chronological precedence of the name Columbium. The latter name is still sometimes used in US industry. This was a compromise of sorts; the IUPAC accepted tungsten instead of wolfram, in deference to North American usage; and niobium instead of columbium, in deference to European usage. Not everyone agreed, and while many leading chemical societies and government organizations refer to it by the official IUPAC name, many leading metallurgists, metal societies, and the United States Geological Survey still refer to the metal by the original \"<i>columbium</i>\".</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<p>Niobium is a lustrous, grey, ductile, paramagnetic metal in group 5 of the periodic table (see table), although it has an atypical configuration in its outermost electron shells compared to the rest of the members. (This can be observed in the neighborhood of ruthenium (44), rhodium (45), and palladium (46).)</p>\n\n<p>Niobium becomes a superconductor at cryogenic temperatures. At atmospheric pressure, it has the highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors: 9.2&nbsp;K. Niobium has the largest magnetic penetration depth of any element. In addition, it is one of the three elemental Type II superconductors, along with vanadium and technetium. The superconductive properties are strongly dependent on the purity of the niobium metal. When very pure, it is comparatively soft and ductile, but impurities make it harder.</p>\n<p>The metal has a low capture cross-section for thermal neutrons; thus it is used in the nuclear industries.</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<p>The metal takes on a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room temperature for extended periods. Despite presenting a high melting point in elemental form (2,468&nbsp;°C), it has a low density in comparison to other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.</p>\n<p>Niobium is slightly less electropositive and more compact than its predecessor in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, owing to the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, its lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding uses such as linings in chemical plants.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of niobium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring niobium is composed of one stable isotope, Nb. As of 2003, at least 32 radioisotopes have also been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 81 to 113. The most stable of these is Nb with a half-life of 34.7&nbsp;million years. One of the least stable is Nb, with an estimated half-life of 30&nbsp;milliseconds. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable Nb tend to decay by β decay, and those that are heavier tend to decay by β decay, with some exceptions. Nb, Nb, and Nb have minor β delayed proton emission decay paths, Nb decays by electron capture and positron emission, and Nb decays by both β and β decay.</p>\n<p>At least 25 nuclear isomers have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 84 to 104. Within this range, only Nb, Nb, and Nb do not have isomers. The most stable of niobium's isomers is Nb with a half-life of 16.13&nbsp;years. The least stable isomer is Nb with a half-life of 103&nbsp;ns. All of niobium's isomers decay by isomeric transition or beta decay except Nb, which has a minor electron capture decay chain.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also: Category:Niobium minerals</div>\n<p>Niobium is estimated to be the 33rd most common element in the Earth’s crust, with 20&nbsp;ppm. Some think that the abundance on Earth should be much greater, but that the \"missing\" niobium may be located in the Earth’s core due to the metal's high density. The free element is not found in nature, but it does occur in minerals. Minerals that contain niobium often also contain tantalum, such as columbite ((Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)O) and columbite–tantalite (or <i>coltan</i>, (Fe,Mn)(Ta,Nb)O). Columbite–tantalite minerals are most usually found as accessory minerals in pegmatite intrusions, and in alkaline intrusive rocks. Less common are the niobates of calcium, uranium, thorium and the rare earth elements such as pyrochlore ((Na,Ca)NbO(OH,F)) and euxenite ((Y,Ca,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)O). These large deposits of niobium have been found associated with carbonatites (carbonate-silicate igneous rocks) and as a constituent of pyrochlore.</p>\n<p>The two largest deposits of pyrochlore were found in the 1950s in Brazil and Canada, and both countries are still the major producers of niobium mineral concentrates. The largest deposit is hosted within a carbonatite intrusion at Araxá, Minas Gerais Brazil, owned by CBMM (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração); the other deposit is located in Goiás and owned by Anglo American plc (through its subsidiary Mineração Catalão), also hosted within a carbonatite intrusion. Altogether these two Brazilian mines produce around 75% of world supply. The third largest producer of niobium is the carbonatite-hosted Niobec Mine, Saint-Honoré near Chicoutimi, Quebec owned by Iamgold Corporation Ltd, which produces around 7% of world supply. Kenya's deposits found in Kwale are ranked amongst the top six in the world.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNiobium producers in 2006</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>After the separation from the other minerals, the mixed oxides of tantalum TaO and niobium NbO are obtained. The first step in the processing is the reaction of the oxides with hydrofluoric acid:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>TaO + 14 HF → 2 H[TaF] + 5 HO</dd>\n<dd>NbO + 10 HF → 2 H[NbOF] + 3 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The first industrial scale separation, developed by de Marignac, exploits the differing solubilities of the complex niobium and tantalum fluorides, dipotassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate (K[NbOF]·HO) and dipotassium heptafluorotantalate (K[TaF]) in water. Newer processes use the liquid extraction of the fluorides from aqueous solution by organic solvents like cyclohexanone. The complex niobium and tantalum fluorides are extracted separately from the organic solvent with water and either precipitated by the addition of potassium fluoride to produce a potassium fluoride complex, or precipitated with ammonia as the pentoxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>H[NbOF] + 2 KF → K[NbOF]↓ + 2 HF</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Followed by:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 H[NbOF] + 10 NHOH → NbO↓ + 10 NHF + 7 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Several methods are used for the reduction to metallic niobium. The electrolysis of a molten mixture of K[NbOF] and sodium chloride is one; the other is the reduction of the fluoride with sodium. With this method niobium with a relatively high purity can be obtained. In large scale production the reduction of NbO with hydrogen or carbon is used. In the process involving the aluminothermic reaction a mixture of iron oxide and niobium oxide is reacted with aluminium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 NbO + FeO + 12 Al → 6 Nb + 2 Fe + 6 AlO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>To enhance the reaction, small amounts of oxidizers like sodium nitrate are added. The result is aluminium oxide and ferroniobium, an alloy of iron and niobium used in the steel production. The ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% of niobium. Without addition of iron oxide, aluminothermic process is used for the production of niobium. Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys. Electron beam melting under vacuum is the method used by the two major distributors of niobium.</p>\n<p>As of 2013, the Brazilian company Cia. Brasileira de Metalurgia &amp; Mineracao \"controls 85 percent of the world's niobium production.\" The United States Geological Survey estimates that the production increased from 38,700 tonnes in 2005 to 44,500 tonnes in 2006. The worldwide resources are estimated to be 4,400,000 tonnes. During the ten-year period between 1995 and 2005, the production more than doubled, starting from 17,800 tonnes in 1995. Since 2009 production is stable at around 63,000 tonnes per year.</p>\n\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also: Category:Niobium compounds</div>\n<p>Niobium is in many ways similar to tantalum and zirconium. It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures: niobium reacts with fluorine at room temperature, with chlorine and hydrogen at 200&nbsp;°C, and with nitrogen at 400&nbsp;°C, giving products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric. The metal begins to oxidize in air at 200&nbsp;°C, and is resistant to corrosion by fused alkalis and by acids, including aqua regia, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids. Niobium is attacked by hydrofluoric acid and hydrofluoric/nitric acid mixtures.</p>\n<p>Although niobium exhibits all of the formal oxidation states from +5 to −1, in most commonly encountered compounds, it is found in the +5 state. Characteristically, compounds in oxidation states less than 5+ display Nb-Nb bonding.</p>\n<h3>Oxides and sulfides</h3>\n<p>Niobium forms oxides with the oxidation states +5 (NbO), +4 (NbO), and +3 (NbO), as well as with the rarer oxidation state +2 (NbO). Most commonly encountered is the pentoxide, precursor to almost all niobium compounds and alloys. Niobates are generated by dissolving the pentoxide in basic hydroxide solutions or by melting it in alkali metal oxides. Examples are lithium niobate (LiNbO) and lanthanum niobate (LaNbO). In the lithium niobate is a trigonally distorted perovskite-like structure, whereas the lanthanum niobate contains lone NbO ions. The layered niobium sulfide (NbS) is also known.</p>\n<p>Materials with a thin film coating of niobium(V) oxide can be produced by chemical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition processes, in each case by the thermal decomposition of niobium(V) ethoxide above 350&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA sample of niobium pentachloride (yellow portion) that has partially hydrolyzed (white material).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBall-and-stick model of niobium pentachloride, which exists as a dimer</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Niobium forms halides in the oxidation states of +5 and +4 as well as diverse substoichiometric compounds. The pentahalides (NbX\n5) feature octahedral Nb centres. Niobium pentafluoride (NbF) is a white solid with a melting point of 79.0&nbsp;°C and niobium pentachloride (NbCl) is yellow (see image at left) with a melting point of 203.4&nbsp;°C. Both are hydrolyzed to give oxides and oxyhalides, such as NbOCl. The pentachloride is a versatile reagent being used to generate the organometallic compounds, such as niobocene dichloride ((C\n5H\n5)\n2NbCl\n2). The tetrahalides (NbX\n4) are dark-coloured polymers with Nb-Nb bonds, for example the black hygroscopic niobium tetrafluoride (NbF) and brown niobium tetrachloride (NbCl).</p>\n<p>Anionic halide compounds of niobium are well known, owing in part to the Lewis acidity of the pentahalides. The most important is [NbF], which is an intermediate in the separation of Nb and Ta from the ores. This heptafluoride tends to form the oxopentafluoride more readily than does the tantalum compound.Other halide complexes include octahedral [NbCl]:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>NbCl + 2 Cl → 2 [NbCl]</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>As for other early metals, a variety of reduced halide clusters are known, the premier example being [NbCl].</p>\n<h3>Nitrides and carbides</h3>\n<p>Other binary compounds of niobium include the niobium nitride (NbN), which becomes a superconductor at low temperatures and is used in detectors for infrared light. The main niobium carbide is NbC, an extremely hard, refractory, ceramic material, commercially used in tool bits for cutting tools.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA niobium foil</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>It is estimated that out of 44,500 metric tons of niobium mined in 2006, 90% was used in the production of high-grade structural steel, followed by its use in superalloys. The use of niobium alloys for superconductors and in electronic components account only for a small share of the production.</p>\n<h3>Steel production</h3>\n<p>Niobium is an effective microalloying element for steel. Adding niobium to the steel causes the formation of niobium carbide and niobium nitride within the structure of the steel. These compounds improve the grain refining, retardation of recrystallization, and precipitation hardening of the steel. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability of the microalloyed steel. Microalloyed stainless steels have a niobium content of less than 0.1%. It is an important alloy addition to high strength low alloy steels which are widely used as structural components in modern automobiles. These niobium-containing alloys are strong and are often used in pipeline construction.</p>\n<h3>Superalloys</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nApollo 15 CSM in lunar orbit with the dark rocket nozzle made from niobium-titanium alloy</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Appreciable amounts of the element, either in its pure form or in the form of high-purity ferroniobium and nickel niobium, are used in nickel-, cobalt-, and iron-based superalloys for such applications as jet engine components, gas turbines, rocket subassemblies, turbo charger systems, and heat resisting and combustion equipment. Niobium precipitates a hardening γ''-phase within the grain structure of the superalloy. The alloys contain up to 6.5% niobium. One example of a nickel-based niobium-containing superalloy is Inconel 718, which consists of roughly 50% nickel, 18.6% chromium, 18.5% iron, 5% niobium, 3.1% molybdenum, 0.9% titanium, and 0.4% aluminium. These superalloys are used, for example, in advanced air frame systems such as those used in the Gemini program.</p>\n<p>An alloy used for liquid rocket thruster nozzles, such as in the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103, which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium. Another niobium alloy was used for the nozzle of the Apollo Service Module. As niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400&nbsp;°C, a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.</p>\n<h3>Superconducting magnets</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA 3 tesla clinical magnetic resonance imaging scanner using niobium-superconducting alloy</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Niobium-germanium (Nb\n3Ge), niobium-tin (Nb\n3Sn), as well as the niobium-titanium alloys are used as a type II superconductor wire for superconducting magnets. These superconducting magnets are used in magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance instruments as well as in particle accelerators. For example, the Large Hadron Collider uses 600 tons of superconducting strands, while the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor is estimated to use 600 tonnes of NbSn strands and 250 tonnes of NbTi strands. In 1992 alone, niobium-titanium wires were used to construct more than US$1&nbsp;billion worth of clinical magnetic resonance imaging systems.</p>\n<h4>Superconducting, other</h4>\n<p>The Superconducting Radio Frequency (RF) cavities used in the free electron lasers TESLA and XFEL are made from pure niobium.</p>\n<p>The high sensitivity of superconducting niobium nitride bolometers make them an ideal detector for electromagnetic radiation in the THz frequency band. These detectors were tested at the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope, the South Pole Telescope, the Receiver Lab Telescope, and at APEX and are now used in the HIFI instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<h4>Electroceramics</h4>\n<p>Lithium niobate, which is a ferroelectric, is used extensively in mobile telephones and optical modulators, and for the manufacture of surface acoustic wave devices. It belongs to the ABO structure ferroelectrics like lithium tantalate and barium titanate. Niobium was evaluated as a cheaper alternative to tantalum in capacitors, but tantalum capacitors are still predominant. Niobium is added to glass in order to attain a higher refractive index, a property of use to the optical industry in making thinner corrective glasses.</p>\n<h4>Hypoallergenic applications: medicine and jewelry</h4>\n<p>Niobium and some niobium alloys are physiologically inert and thus hypoallergenic. For this reason, niobium is found in many medical devices such as pacemakers. Niobium treated with sodium hydroxide forms a porous layer that aids osseointegration.</p>\n<p>Along with titanium, tantalum, and aluminium, niobium can also be electrically heated and anodized, resulting in a wide array of colours using a process known as reactive metal anodizing which is useful in making jewelry. The fact that niobium is hypoallergenic also benefits its use in jewelry.</p>\n<h4>Numismatics</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway Coin made of niobium and silver</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Niobium is used as a precious metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver niobium euro coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the diffraction of light by a thin oxide layer produced by anodising. In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow. Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian €25 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin, and the 2006 Austrian €25 European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin. The Austrian mint produced for Latvia a similar series of coins starting in 2004, with one following in 2007. In 2011, the Royal Canadian Mint started production of a $5 sterling silver and niobium coin named <i>Hunter's Moon</i> in which the niobium was selectively oxidized, thus creating unique finishes where no two coins are exactly alike.</p>\n<h4>Other</h4>\n<p>The arc-tube seals of high pressure sodium vapor lamps are made from niobium, or niobium with 1% of zirconium, because niobium has a very similar coefficient of thermal expansion to the sintered alumina arc tube ceramic, a translucent material which resists chemical attack or reduction by the hot liquid sodium and sodium vapour contained inside the operating lamp. The metal is also used in arc welding rods for some stabilized grades of stainless steel. It is also used as a material in anodes for cathodic protection systems on some water tanks, which are then usually plated by platinum.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Niobium has no known biological role. While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant and a potential fire hazard, elemental niobium on a larger scale is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants.</p>\n<p>Niobium-containing compounds are rarely encountered by most people, but some are toxic and should be treated with care. The short and long term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD) between 10 and 100&nbsp;mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD after seven days of 940&nbsp;mg/kg.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ See:\n<ul>\n<li>Charles Hatchett (1802) \"An analysis of a mineral substance from North America, containing a metal hitherto unknown\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 92&nbsp;: 49–66.</li>\n<li>Hatchett, Charles (1802). \"Eigenschaften und chemisches Verhalten des von Charles Hatchett entdeckten neuen Metalls, Columbium\" [Properties and chemical behavior of the new metal, columbium, (that was) discovered by Charles Hatchett].

  "title": "Molybdenum",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Molybdenum</b> is a Group 6 chemical element with the symbol <b>Mo</b> and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin <i>Molybdaenum</i>, from Ancient Greek Μόλυβδος <i>molybdos</i>, meaning <i>lead</i>, since its ores were confused with lead ores. Molybdenum minerals have been known into prehistory, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.</p>\n<p>Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth, but rather in various oxidation states in minerals. The free element, which is a silvery metal with a gray cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element. It readily forms hard, stable carbides in alloys, and for this reason most of world production of the element (about 80%) is in making many types of steel alloys, including high strength alloys and superalloys.</p>\n<p>Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but the molybdate ion MoO is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water. Industrially, molybdenum compounds (about 14% of world production of the element) are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications, as pigments and catalysts.</p>\n<p>Molybdenum-containing enzymes are by far the most common catalysts used by some bacteria to break the chemical bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen, allowing biological nitrogen fixation. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes are now known in bacteria and animals, although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation, and these nitrogenases contain molybdenum in a different form from the rest. Owing to the diverse functions of the various other types of molybdenum enzymes, molybdenum is a required element for life in all higher organisms (eukaryotes), though not in all bacteria.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>In its pure form, molybdenum is a silvery-grey metal with a Mohs hardness of 5.5. It has a melting point of 2,623 °C (4,753&nbsp;°F); of the naturally occurring elements, only tantalum, osmium, rhenium, tungsten, and carbon have higher melting points. Weak oxidation of molybdenum starts at 300 °C. It has one of the lowest coefficients of thermal expansion among commercially used metals. The tensile strength of molybdenum wires increases about 3 times, from about 10 to 30&nbsp;GPa, when their diameter decreases from ~50–100&nbsp;nm to 10&nbsp;nm.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of molybdenum</div>\n<p>There are 35 known isotopes of molybdenum, ranging in atomic mass from 83 to 117, as well as four metastable nuclear isomers. Seven isotopes occur naturally, with atomic masses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. Of these naturally occurring isotopes, only molybdenum-100 is unstable.</p>\n<p>Molybdenum-98 is the most abundant isotope, comprising 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 10&nbsp;y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150&nbsp;ns. All unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium, technetium, and ruthenium.</p>\n<p>As also noted below, the most common isotopic molybdenum application involves molybdenum-99, which is a fission product. It is a parent radioisotope to the short-lived gamma-emitting daughter radioisotope technetium-99m, a nuclear isomer used in various imaging applications in medicine. In 2008, the Delft University of Technology applied for a patent on the molybdenum-98-based production of molybdenum-99.</p>\n<h3>Compounds and chemistry</h3>\n<div>See also category: Molybdenum compounds</div>\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nKeggin structure of the phosphomolybdate anion (P[MoO]), an example of a polyoxometalate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Molybdenum is a transition metal with an electronegativity of 2.16 on the Pauling scale and a standard atomic weight of 95.96&nbsp;g/mol. It does not visibly react with oxygen or water at room temperature, and the bulk oxidation occurs at temperatures above 600 °C, resulting in molybdenum trioxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Mo + 3 O\n2 → 2 MoO\n3</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The trioxide is volatile and sublimates at high temperatures. This prevents formation of a continuous protective oxide layer, which would stop the bulk oxidation of metal. Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table). The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to those of tungsten than that of chromium. An example is the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds as compared with the stability of the chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is common in the molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO), whereas the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide MoS.</p>\n<p>Molybdenum(VI) oxide is soluble in strong alkaline water, forming molybdates (MoO). Molybdates are weaker oxidants than chromates, but they show a similar tendency to form complex oxyanions by condensation at lower pH values, such as [MoO] and [MoO]. Polymolybdates can incorporate other ions into their structure, forming polyoxometalates. The dark-blue phosphorus-containing heteropolymolybdate P[MoO] is used for the spectroscopic detection of phosphorus. The broad range of oxidation states of molybdenum is reflected in various molybdenum chlorides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Molybdenum(II) chloride MoCl (yellow solid)</li>\n<li>Molybdenum(III) chloride MoCl (dark red solid)</li>\n<li>Molybdenum(IV) chloride MoCl (black solid)</li>\n<li>Molybdenum(V) chloride MoCl (dark green solid)</li>\n<li>Molybdenum(VI) chloride MoCl (brown solid)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The structure of the MoCl is composed of MoCl clusters with four chloride ions to compensate the charge.</p>\n<p>Like chromium and some other transition metals, molybdenum is able to form quadruple bonds, such as in Mo(CHCOO). This compound can be transformed into MoCl, which also has a quadruple bond.</p>\n<p>The oxidation state 0 is possible with carbon monoxide as ligand, such as in molybdenum hexacarbonyl, Mo(CO).</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Molybdenite—the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extracted—was previously known as molybdena. Molybdena was confused with and often utilized as though it were graphite. Like graphite, molybdenite can be used to blacken a surface or as a solid lubricant. Even when molybdena was distinguishable from graphite, it was still confused with the common lead ore PbS (now called galena); the name comes from Ancient Greek Μόλυβδος <i>molybdos</i>, meaning <i>lead</i>. (The Greek word itself has been proposed as a loanword from Anatolian Luvian and Lydian languages).</p>\n<p>Although apparent deliberate alloying of molybdenum with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330) has been reported, that art was never employed widely and was later lost. In the West in 1754, Bengt Andersson Qvist examined molybdenite and determined that it did <i>not</i> contain lead, and thus was not the same as galena.</p>\n<p>By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated firmly that molybdena was (indeed) not galena nor graphite. Instead, Scheele went further and correctly proposed that molybdena was an ore of a distinct new element, named <i>molybdenum</i> for the mineral in which it resided, and from which it might be isolated. Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum by using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.</p>\n<p>For about a century after its isolation, molybdenum had no industrial use, owing to its relative scarcity, difficulty extracting the pure metal, and the immaturity of appropriate metallurgical techniques. Early molybdenum steel alloys showed great promise in their increased hardness, but efforts to manufacture them on a large scale were hampered by inconsistent results and a tendency toward brittleness and recrystallization. In 1906, William D. Coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile, leading to its use as a heating element for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas. In 1913, Frank E. Elmore developed a flotation process to recover molybdenite from ores; flotation remains the primary isolation process</p>\n<p>During the first World War, demand for molybdenum spiked; it was used both in armor plating and as a substitute for tungsten in high speed steels. Some British tanks were protected by 75&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;in) manganese steel plating, but this proved to be ineffective. The manganese steel plates were replaced with 25&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;in) molybdenum-steel plating allowing for higher speed, greater maneuverability, and better protection. The Germans also used molybdenum-doped steel for heavy artillery. This was because traditional steel melted at the heat produced by enough gunpowder to launch a one ton shell. After the war, demand plummeted until metallurgical advances allowed extensive development of peacetime applications. In World War II, molybdenum again saw strategic importance as a substitute for tungsten in steel alloys.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMolybdenite on quartz</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Molybdenum is the 54th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the 25th most abundant element in the oceans, with an average of 10&nbsp;parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant element in the Universe. The Russian Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6&nbsp;µm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon. The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur, in the same way as copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO) and powellite (CaMoO), the main commercial source of molybdenum is molybdenite (MoS). Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore, and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.</p>\n<p>Historically, the Knaben mine in southern Norway, opened in 1885, was the first dedicated molybdenum mine. It closed from 1973–2007, but is now reopened. Large mines in Colorado (such as the Henderson mine and the Climax mine) and in British Columbia yield molybdenite as their primary product, while many porphyry copper deposits such as the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah and the Chuquicamata mine in northern Chile produce molybdenum as a byproduct of copper mining.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMolybdenum output in 2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The world's production of molybdenum was 250,000 tonnes in 2011, the largest producers being China (94,000&nbsp;t), United States (64,000&nbsp;t), Chile (38,000&nbsp;t), Peru (18,000&nbsp;t) and Mexico (12,000&nbsp;t). The total reserves are estimated at 10 million tonnes, and are mostly concentrated in China (4.3&nbsp;mt), US (2.7&nbsp;mt) and Chile (1.2&nbsp;mt). By continent, 93% of world molybdenum production is about evenly split between North America, South America (mainly in Chile), and China. Europe and the rest of Asia (mostly Armenia, Russia, Iran and Mongolia) produce the remainder.</p>\n<h2>Production of the metal</h2>\n<p>In molybdenite processing, the molybdenite is first heated to a temperature of 700 °C (1,292&nbsp;°F) and the sulfide is oxidized into molybdenum(VI) oxide by air:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 MoS + 7 O → 2 MoO + 4 SO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The oxidized ore is then either heated to 1,100 °C (2,010&nbsp;°F) to sublimate the oxide, or leached with ammonia, which reacts with the molybdenum(VI) oxide to form water-soluble molybdates:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>MoO + 2 NHOH → (NH)(MoO) + HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Copper, an impurity in molybdenite, is less soluble in ammonia. To completely remove it from the solution, it is precipitated with hydrogen sulfide.</p>\n<p>Pure molybdenum is produced by reduction of the oxide with hydrogen, while the molybdenum for steel production is reduced by the aluminothermic reaction with addition of iron to produce ferromolybdenum. A common form of ferromolybdenum contains 60% molybdenum.</p>\n<p>Molybdenum has a value of approximately $30,000 per tonne as of August 2009. It maintained a price at or near $10,000 per tonne from 1997 through 2003, and reached, due to increased demand, a peak of $103,000 per tonne in June 2005. In 2008 the London Metal Exchange announced that molybdenum would be traded as a commodity on the exchange.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>About 86% of molybdenum produced is used in metallurgical applications such as alloys, with the rest of molybdenum used as compounds in chemical applications. Estimated fractional global industrial use of molybdenum is structural steel 35%, stainless steel 25%, chemicals 14%, tool &amp; high-speed steels 9%, cast iron 6%, molybdenum elemental metal 6%, and superalloys, 5%.</p>\n<p>The ability of molybdenum to withstand extreme temperatures without significantly expanding or softening makes it useful in applications that involve intense heat, including the manufacture of armor, aircraft parts, electrical contacts, industrial motors and filaments.</p>\n<p>Most high-strength steel alloys (example 41xx steels) contain 0.25% to 8% molybdenum. Despite such small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of molybdenum are used as an alloying agent each year in stainless steels, tool steels, cast irons and high-temperature superalloys.</p>\n<p>Molybdenum is also used in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes further corrosion resistance to \"chrome-moly\" type-300 stainless steels (high-chromium steels that are corrosion-resistant already due to their chromium content, but in reality \"chrome-moly\" is not a type-300 stainless, but instead a 41xx series that is not stainless) and especially so in the so-called superaustenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN). Molybdenum acts by increasing lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve out iron atoms from the surface.</p>\n<p>Because of its lower density and more stable price, molybdenum is sometimes used instead of tungsten. An example is the 'M' series of high-speed steels such as M2, M4 and M42 as substitution for the 'T' steel series, which contain tungsten. Molybdenum can be implemented both as an alloying agent and as a flame-resistant coating for other metals. Although its melting point is 2,623 °C (4,753&nbsp;°F), molybdenum rapidly oxidizes at temperatures above 760 °C (1,400&nbsp;°F) making it better-suited for use in vacuum environments.</p>\n<p>TZM (Mo (~99%), Ti (~0.5%), Zr (~0.08%) and some C) is a corrosion-resisting molybdenum superalloy that resists molten fluoride salts at temperatures above 1300C. It has about twice the strength of pure Mo, and is more ductile and more weldable, yet in tests it resisted corrosion of a standard eutectic salt (FLiBe) and salt vapors used in molten salt reactors for 1100 hours with so little corrosion that it was difficult to measure.</p>\n<p>Other molybdenum-based alloys that do not contain iron have only limited applications. For example, because of the corrosion resistance against molten zinc, both pure molybdenum and the molybdenum/tungsten alloy (70%/30%) are used for piping, stirrers and pump impellers which come into contact with molten zinc.</p>\n<h3>Other applications as the pure element</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Molybdenum powder is used as a fertilizer for some plants, such as cauliflower.</li>\n<li>Elemental molybdenum is also used in NO, NO, NO analyzers in power plants for pollution controls. At 350 °C (662&nbsp;°F) the element acts as a catalyst for NO/NO to form only NO molecules for consistent readings by infrared light.</li>\n<li>Molybdenum anodes replace tungsten in certain low voltage X-ray sources, for specialized uses such as mammography.</li>\n<li>The radioactive isotope molybdenum-99 is used to generate technetium-99m, which is used for medical imaging.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compounds (14% of global use)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Molybdenum disulfide (MoS) is used as a solid lubricant and a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) antiwear agent. It forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases — in the event of a catastrophic grease failure, a thin layer of molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated parts. It also has semiconducting properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications. MoS is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.</li>\n<li>Molybdenum disilicide (MoSi) is an electrically conducting ceramic with primary use in heating elements operating at temperatures above 1500&nbsp;°C in air.</li>\n<li>Molybdenum trioxide (MoO) is used as an adhesive between enamels and metals. Lead molybdate (wulfenite) co-precipitated with lead chromate and lead sulfate is a bright-orange pigment used with ceramics and plastics.</li>\n<li>Ammonium heptamolybdate is used in biological staining procedures.</li>\n<li>Molybdenum coated soda lime glass is used for CIGS solar cell fabrication.</li>\n<li>Phosphomolybdic acid is a stain used in thin layer chromatography.</li>\n<li>Molybdenum-99 is a parent radioisotope to the daughter radioisotope technetium-99m, which is used in many medical procedures. The isotope is handled and stored as the molybdate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<h3>Biochemistry</h3>\n<p>The most important role of the molybdenum in living organisms is as a metal heteroatom at the active site in certain enzymes. In nitrogen fixation in certain bacteria, the nitrogenase enzyme, which is involved in the terminal step of reducing molecular nitrogen, usually contains molybdenum in the active site (though replacement of Mo with iron or vanadium is also known). The structure of the catalytic center of the enzyme is similar to that in iron-sulfur proteins: it incorporates a FeS and multiple MoFeS clusters.</p>\n<p>In 2008, evidence was reported that a scarcity of molybdenum in the Earth's early oceans was a limiting factor for nearly two billion years in the further evolution of eukaryotic life (which includes all plants and animals) as eukaryotes cannot fix nitrogen, and must therefore acquire most of their oxidized nitrogen suitable for making organic nitrogen compounds, or the organics themselves (like proteins) from prokaryotic bacteria. The scarcity of molybdenum resulted from the relative lack of oxygen in the early ocean. Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but the molybdate ion MoO is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water. Once oxygen made by early life appeared in seawater, it helped dissolve molybdenum into soluble molybdate from minerals on the sea bottom, making it available for the first time to nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and allowing them to provide more fixed usable nitrogen compounds for higher forms of life.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe molybdenum cofactor (pictured) is composed of a molybdenum-free organic complex called molybdopterin, which has bound an oxidized molybdenum atom through adjacent sulfur (or occasionally selenium) atoms.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Although oxygen once promoted nitrogen fixation via making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes. Thus, in Earth's ancient history, after oxygen arrived in large quantities in Earth's air and water, organisms that continued to fix nitrogen in aerobic conditions were required to isolate and protect their nitrogen-fixing enzymes in heterocysts, or similar structures protecting them from too much oxygen. This structural isolation of nitrogen fixation reactions from oxygen in aerobic organisms continues to the present.</p>\n<p>Though molybdenum forms compounds with various organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout the human body as MoO. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes were known by 2002, mostly in bacteria, and their number is increasing with every year; those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional to the amount of molybdenum in the body. However, an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can act as an inhibitor in both purine catabolism and other processes. Molybdenum concentrations also affect protein synthesis, metabolism and growth.</p>\n<p>In animals and plants a tricyclic compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate to form a complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor. Save for the phylogenetically-ancient molybdenum nitrogenases discussed above, which fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes so far identified in nature use the molybdenum cofactor. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules, as part of the regulation of nitrogen, sulfur and carbon cycles.</p>\n<h3>Human dietary intake and deficiency</h3>\n<p>The human body contains about 0.07&nbsp;mg of molybdenum per kilogram of weight. It occurs in higher concentrations in the liver and kidneys and in lower concentrations in the vertebrae. Molybdenum is also present within human tooth enamel and may help prevent its decay.</p>\n<p>The average daily intake of molybdenum varies between 0.12 and 0.24&nbsp;mg, depending on the molybdenum content of the food. Pork, lamb, and beef liver each have approximately 1.5 parts per million of molybdenum. Other significant dietary sources include green beans, eggs, sunflower seeds, wheat flour, lentils, cucumbers and cereal grain. Acute toxicity has not been seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD) as low as 180&nbsp;mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10&nbsp;mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.</p>\n<p>Dietary molybdenum deficiency from low soil concentration of molybdenum has been associated with increased rates of esophageal cancer in a geographical band from northern China to Iran. Compared to the United States, which has a greater supply of molybdenum in the soil, people living in these areas have about 16 times greater risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</p>\n<p>Molybdenum deficiency has also been reported as a consequence of non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, in much the same way as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However, presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this mechanism is seen primarily in adults, the neurological consequences have not been as marked as for the congenital cofactor deficiency.</p>\n<p>In humans, four enzymes depend on molybdenum: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidoreductase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reductase. People severely deficient in molybdenum have poorly functioning sulfite oxidase and are prone to toxic reactions to sulfites in foods.</p>\n<h3>Related diseases</h3>\n<p>A congenital molybdenum cofactor deficiency disease, seen in infants, results in interference with the ability of the body to use molybdenum in enzymes. It causes high levels of sulfite and urate, and neurological damage. The cause is the inability of the body to synthesize molybdenum cofactor, a heterocyclic molecule that binds molybdenum at the active site in all known human enzymes that use molybdenum.</p>\n<h3>Copper-molybdenum antagonism</h3>\n<p>High levels of molybdenum can interfere with the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high amounts of molybdenum develop symptoms including diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia and achromotrichia (loss of hair pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by the administration of more copper into the system, both in dietary form and by injection. The condition, as an effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.</p>\n<p>Copper reduction or deficiency can also be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion <b>tetrathiomolybdate</b> is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically in the treatment of copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially via the inhibition of copper ion dependent membrane translocation process involving a non-classical secretion pathway. This makes it an interesting investigatory treatment for cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and other diseases featuring excessive blood vessel deposition.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Molybdenum dusts and fumes, which can be generated by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust trapped in the sinuses and later swallowed). Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides should be avoided. OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum exposure in an 8-hour day as 5&nbsp;mg/m. Chronic exposure to 60 to 600&nbsp;mg/m can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ \"Molybdenum: molybdenum(I) fluoride compound data\".

  "title": "Technetium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Technetium</b> is the chemical element with atomic number 43 and symbol <b>Tc</b>. It is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes; every form of it is radioactive. Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts are found in nature. Naturally occurring technetium occurs as a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or by neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.</p>\n<p>Many of technetium's properties were predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev before the element was discovered. Mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name <i>ekamanganese</i> (<i>Em</i>). In 1937, technetium (specifically the technetium-97 isotope) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced, hence its name (from the Greek τεχνητός, meaning \"artificial\").</p>\n<p>Its short-lived gamma ray-emitting nuclear isomer—technetium-99m—is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of diagnostic tests. Technetium-99 is used as a gamma ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2&nbsp;million years (technetium-98), its detection in 1952 in red giants, which are billions of years old, helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Search for element 43</h3>\n<p>From the 1860s through 1871, early forms of the periodic table proposed by Dimitri Mendeleev contained a gap between molybdenum (element&nbsp;42) and ruthenium (element&nbsp;44). In 1871, Mendeleev predicted this missing element would occupy the empty place below manganese and therefore have similar chemical properties. Mendeleev gave it the provisional name <i>ekamanganese</i> (from <i>eka</i>-, the Sanskrit word for <i>one</i>, because the predicted element was one place down from the known element manganese.)</p>\n<p>Many early researchers, both before and after the periodic table was published, were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element; its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements. It was first thought to have been found in platinum ores in 1828 and was given the name <i>polinium</i>, but turned out to be impure iridium. Then, in 1846, the element <i>ilmenium</i> was claimed to have been discovered, but later was determined to be impure niobium. This mistake was repeated in 1847 with the \"discovery\" of <i>pelopium</i>.</p>\n<p>In 1877, the Russian chemist Serge Kern reported discovering the missing element in platinum ore. Kern named what he thought was the new element <i>davyum</i> (after the noted English chemist Sir Humphry Davy), but it was eventually determined to be a mixture of iridium, rhodium and iron. Another candidate, <i>lucium</i>, followed in 1896, but it was determined to be yttrium. Then in 1908, the Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa found evidence in the mineral thorianite, which he thought indicated the presence of element&nbsp;43. Ogawa named the element <i>nipponium</i>, after Japan (which is <i>Nippon</i> in Japanese). In 2004, H. K Yoshihara used \"a&nbsp;record of X-ray spectrum of Ogawa's nipponium sample from thorianite [which] was contained in a photographic plate preserved by his family. The spectrum was read and indicated the absence of the element&nbsp;43 and the presence of the element&nbsp;75 (rhenium).\"</p>\n<p>German chemists Walter Noddack, Otto Berg, and Ida Tacke reported the discovery of element&nbsp;75 and element&nbsp;43 in 1925, and named element&nbsp;43 <i>masurium</i> (after Masuria in eastern Prussia, now in Poland, the region where Walter Noddack's family originated). The group bombarded columbite with a beam of electrons and deduced element&nbsp;43 was present by examining X-ray diffraction spectrograms. The wavelength of the X-rays produced is related to the atomic number by a formula derived by Henry Moseley in 1913. The team claimed to detect a faint X-ray signal at a wavelength produced by element&nbsp;43. Later experimenters could not replicate the discovery, and it was dismissed as an error for many years. Still, in 1933, a series of articles on the discovery of elements quoted the name <i>masurium</i> for element&nbsp;43. Debate still exists as to whether the 1925 team actually did discover element&nbsp;43.</p>\n<h3>Official discovery and later history</h3>\n<p>The discovery of element&nbsp;43 was finally confirmed in a December 1936 experiment at the University of Palermo in Sicily conducted by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segrè. In mid-1936, Segrè visited the United States, first Columbia University in New York and then the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He persuaded cyclotron inventor Ernest Lawrence to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become radioactive. Lawrence mailed him a molybdenum foil that had been part of the deflector in the cyclotron.</p>\n<p>Segrè enlisted his colleague Perrier to attempt to prove, through comparative chemistry, that the molybdenum activity was indeed from an element with <i>Z</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;43. They succeeded in isolating the isotopes technetium-95m and technetium-97. University of Palermo officials wanted them to name their discovery \"<i>panormium</i>\", after the Latin name for Palermo, <i>Panormus</i>. In 1947 element&nbsp;43 was named after the Greek word <i>τεχνητός</i>, meaning \"artificial\", since it was the first element to be artificially produced. Segrè returned to Berkeley and met Glenn T. Seaborg. They isolated the metastable isotope technetium-99m, which is now used in some ten million medical diagnostic procedures annually.</p>\n<p>In 1952, astronomer Paul W. Merrill in California detected the spectral signature of technetium (in particular, light with wavelength of 403.1&nbsp;nm, 423.8&nbsp;nm, 426.2&nbsp;nm, and 429.7&nbsp;nm) in light from S-type red giants. The stars were near the end of their lives, yet were rich in this short-lived element, meaning nuclear reactions within the stars must be producing it. This evidence was used to bolster the then-unproven theory that stars are where nucleosynthesis of the heavier elements occurs. More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements were being formed by neutron capture in the s-process.</p>\n<p>Since its discovery, there have been many searches in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium. In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the Belgian Congo in extremely small quantities (about 0.2&nbsp;ng/kg); there it originates as a spontaneous fission product of uranium-238. There is also evidence that the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor produced significant amounts of technetium-99, which has since decayed into ruthenium-99.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Technetium is a silvery-gray radioactive metal with an appearance similar to that of platinum. It is commonly obtained as a gray powder. The crystal structure of the pure metal is hexagonal close-packed. Atomic technetium has characteristic emission lines at these wavelengths of light: 363.3&nbsp;nm, 403.1&nbsp;nm, 426.2&nbsp;nm, 429.7&nbsp;nm, and 485.3&nbsp;nm.</p>\n<p>The metal form is slightly paramagnetic, meaning its magnetic dipoles align with external magnetic fields, but will assume random orientations once the field is removed. Pure, metallic, single-crystal technetium becomes a type-II superconductor at temperatures below 7.46&nbsp;K. Below this temperature, technetium has a very high magnetic penetration depth, the largest among the elements apart from niobium.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Technetium is placed in the seventh group of the periodic table, between rhenium and manganese. As predicted by the periodic law, its chemical properties are therefore intermediate between those two elements. Of the two, technetium more closely resembles rhenium, particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form covalent bonds. Unlike manganese, technetium does not readily form cations (ions with a net positive charge). Common oxidation states of technetium include +4, +5, and +7. Technetium dissolves in aqua regia, nitric acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid, but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any concentration.</p>\n<h4>Hydride and oxides</h4>\n<p>The reaction of technetium with hydrogen produces the negatively charged hydride TcH2−\n9 ion, which has the same type of crystal structure as (is isostructural with) ReH2−\n9. It consists of a trigonal prism with a technetium atom in the center and six hydrogen atoms at the corners. Three more hydrogen atoms make a triangle lying parallel to the base and crossing the prism in its center. Although those hydrogen atoms are not equivalent geometrically, their electronic structure is almost the same. This complex has a coordination number of 9 (meaning that the technetium atom has nine neighbors), which is the highest for a technetium complex. Two hydrogen atoms in the complex can be replaced by sodium (Na) or potassium (K) ions.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTechnetium hydride</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Metallic technetium slowly tarnishes in moist air, and in powder form, will burn in oxygen. Two oxides have been observed: TcO and TcO. Under oxidizing conditions, which tend to strip electrons from atoms, technetium(VII) will exist as the pertechnetate ion, TcO−\n4.</p>\n<p>At temperatures of 400–450&nbsp;°C, technetium oxidizes to form the pale-yellow heptoxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Tc + 7 O → 2 TcO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This compound adopts a centrosymmetric structure with two types of Tc-O bonds; their bond lengths are 167 and 184&nbsp;pm, and the O-Tc-O angle is 180°.</p>\n<p>Technetium heptoxide is the precursor to sodium pertechnetate:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>TcO + 2 NaOH → 2 NaTcO + HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Black-colored technetium dioxide (TcO) can be produced by reduction of heptoxide with technetium or hydrogen.</p>\n<p>Pertechnetic acid (HTcO) is produced by reacting TcO with water or oxidizing acids, such as nitric acid, concentrated sulfuric acid, aqua regia, or a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids. The resulting dark red, hygroscopic (water absorbing) substance is a strong acid and easily donates protons. In concentrated sulfuric acid Tc(VII) tetraoxidotechnetate anion converts to the octahedral form of technetic(VII) acid TcO(OH)(HO).</p>\n<p>The pertechnate (tetroxidotechnetate) anion TcO−\n4 consists of a tetrahedron with oxygens in the corners and a technetium atom in the center. Unlike permanganate (MnO−\n4), it is only a weak oxidizing agent. Pertechnate is often used as a convenient water-soluble source of technetium isotopes, such as Tc, and as a catalyst.</p>\n<h4>Sulfides, selenides, and tellurides</h4>\n<p>Technetium forms various sulfides. TcS is obtained by direct reaction of technetium and elemental sulfur, while TcS is formed from the pertechnic acid as follows:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 HTcO + 7 HS → TcS + 8 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In this reaction technetium is reduced to Tc(IV) while excess sulfur forms a disulfide ligand. The produced technetium heptasulfide has a polymeric structure (Tc(µ–S)(S)S) with a core similar to Mo(µ–S)(S).</p>\n<p>Upon heating, technetium heptasulfide decomposes into disulfide and elementary sulfur:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>TcS → 2 TcS + 3 S</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Analogous reactions occur with selenium and tellurium.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTechnetium clusters Tc and Tc</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Technetium carbide and orthorhombic technetium metal phase</h4>\n<p>When small amounts of carbon are present in technetium metal, its ideal close-packed hexagonal crystal structure is distorted to orthorhombic technetium metal structure. Higher content of carbon (starting from 15-17% at.) provide complete conversion of technetium metal to cubic technetium carbide with approximate composition of Tc6C. The further increase in carbon content does not provide any change in technetium carbide structure.</p>\n<h4>Clusters and organic complexes</h4>\n<p>Several technetium clusters are known, including Tc, Tc, Tc and Tc. The more stable Tc and Tc clusters have prism shapes where vertical pairs of Tc atoms are connected by triple bonds and the planar atoms by single bonds. Every technetium atom makes six bonds, and the remaining valence electrons can be saturated by one axial and two bridging ligand halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOrganic complex of technetium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Technetium forms numerous organic complexes, which are relatively well-investigated because of their importance for nuclear medicine. Technetium carbonyl (Tc(CO)) is a white solid. In this molecule, two technetium atoms are weakly bound to each other; each atom is surrounded by octahedra of five carbonyl ligands. The bond length between technetium atoms, 303&nbsp;pm, is significantly larger than the distance between two atoms in metallic technetium (272&nbsp;pm). Similar carbonyls are formed by technetium's congeners, manganese and rhenium.</p>\n<p>A technetium complex with an organic ligand (shown in the figure on right) is commonly used in nuclear medicine. It has a unique Tc-O functional group (moiety) oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the molecule, where the oxygen atom can be replaced by a nitrogen atom.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of technetium</div>\n<p>Technetium, with atomic number (denoted <i>Z</i>) 43, is the lowest-numbered element in the periodic table that is exclusively radioactive. The second-lightest, exclusively radioactive element, promethium, has an atomic number of 61. Atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons are less stable than those with even numbers, even when the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) are even. Odd numbered elements therefore have fewer stable isotopes.</p>\n<p>The most stable radioactive isotopes are technetium-98 with a half-life of 4.2&nbsp;million&nbsp;years (Ma), technetium-97 (half-life: 2.6&nbsp;Ma) and technetium-99 (half-life: 211,000&nbsp;years). Thirty other radioisotopes have been characterized with mass numbers ranging from 85 to 118. Most of these have half-lives that are less than an hour; the exceptions are technetium-93 (half-life: 2.73&nbsp;hours), technetium-94 (half-life: 4.88&nbsp;hours), technetium-95 (half-life: 20&nbsp;hours), and technetium-96 (half-life: 4.3&nbsp;days).</p>\n<p>The primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than technetium-98 (Tc) is electron capture, giving molybdenum (<i>Z</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;42). For heavier isotopes, the primary mode is beta emission (the emission of an electron or positron), giving ruthenium (<i>Z</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;44), with the exception that technetium-100 can decay both by beta emission and electron capture.</p>\n<p>Technetium also has numerous nuclear isomers, which are isotopes with one or more excited nucleons. Technetium-97m (Tc; 'm' stands for metastability) is the most stable, with a half-life of 91&nbsp;days (0.0965&nbsp;MeV). This is followed by technetium-95m (half-life: 61&nbsp;days, 0.03&nbsp;MeV), and technetium-99m (half-life: 6.01 hours, 0.142&nbsp;MeV). Technetium-99m only emits gamma rays and decays to technetium-99.</p>\n<p>Technetium-99 (Tc) is a major product of the fission of uranium-235 (U), making it the most common and most readily available isotope of technetium. One gram of technetium-99 produces 6.2×10&nbsp;disintegrations a second (that is, 0.62&nbsp;GBq/g).</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUranium ores contain traces of technetium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Only minute traces of Technetium occur naturally in the Earth's crust. This is due to the fact that Technetium's half-life is only 4.2 million years. Over three hundred twenty-seven half-lives have passed since the formation on the Earth, meaning that less than one centillionth of one percent of primordial Technetium (~1.608579×10) should exist. However, small amountes do exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1&nbsp;nanogram (10&nbsp;g) of technetium. Some red giant stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain an absorption line in their spectrum indicating the presence of technetium. These red-giants are known informally as technetium stars.</p>\n<h3>Fission waste product</h3>\n<p>In contrast with its rare natural occurrence, bulk quantities of technetium-99 are produced each year from spent nuclear fuel rods, which contain various fission products. The fission of a gram of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors yields 27&nbsp;mg of technetium-99, giving technetium a fission product yield of 6.1%. Other fissile isotopes also produce similar yields of technetium, such as 4.9% from uranium-233 and 6.21% from plutonium-239. About 49,000&nbsp;TBq (78&nbsp;metric tons) of technetium is estimated to have been produced in nuclear reactors between 1983 and 1994, which is by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium. Only a fraction of the production is used commercially.</p>\n<p>Technetium-99 is produced by the nuclear fission of both uranium-235 and plutonium-239. It is therefore present in radioactive waste and in the nuclear fallout of fission bomb explosions. Its decay, measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel, is dominant after about 10 to 10&nbsp;years after the creation of the nuclear waste. From 1945 to 1994, an estimated 160&nbsp;TBq (about 250&nbsp;kg) of technetium-99 was released into the environment by atmospheric nuclear tests. The amount of technetium-99 from nuclear reactors released into the environment up to 1986 is on the order of 1000&nbsp;TBq (about 1600&nbsp;kg), primarily by nuclear fuel reprocessing; most of this was discharged into the sea. Reprocessing methods have reduced emissions since then, but as of 2005 the primary release of technetium-99 into the environment is by the Sellafield plant, which released an estimated 550&nbsp;TBq (about 900&nbsp;kg) from 1995–1999 into the Irish Sea. From 2000 onwards the amount has been limited by regulation to 90&nbsp;TBq (about 140&nbsp;kg) per year. Discharge of technetium into the sea has resulted in some seafood containing minuscule quantities of this element. For example, European lobster and fish from west Cumbria contain about 1&nbsp;Bq/kg of technetium.</p>\n<h3>Fission product for commercial use</h3>\n<p>The metastable isotope technetium-99m is continuously produced as a fission product from the fission of uranium or plutonium in nuclear reactors. Because used fuel is allowed to stand for several years before reprocessing, all molybdenum-99 and technetium-99m will have decayed by the time that the fission products are separated from the major actinides in conventional nuclear reprocessing. The liquid left after plutonium–uranium extraction (PUREX) contains a high concentration of technetium as TcO−\n4 but almost all of this is technetium-99, not technetium-99m.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of the technetium-99m used in medical work is produced by irradiating dedicated highly enriched uranium targets in a reactor, extracting molybdenum-99 from the targets in reprocessing facilities, and recovering at the diagnostic center the technetium-99m that is produced upon decay of molybdenum-99. Molybdenum-99 in the form of molybdate MoO2−\n4 is adsorbed onto acid alumina (Al\n2O\n3) in a shielded column chromatograph inside a technetium-99m generator (\"technetium cow\", also occasionally called a \"molybdenum cow\"). Molybdenum-99 has a half-life of 67&nbsp;hours, so short-lived technetium-99m (half-life: 6&nbsp;hours), which results from its decay, is being constantly produced. The soluble pertechnetate TcO−\n4 can then be chemically extracted by elution using a saline solution.</p>\n<p>By irradiating a highly enriched uranium target to produce molybdenum-99, there is no need for the complex chemical steps which would be required to separate molybdenum from a fission product mixture. A drawback of this process is that it requires targets containing uranium-235, which are subject to the security precautions of fissile materials.</p>\n<p>Almost two-thirds of the world's supply comes from two reactors; the National Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, Canada, and the High Flux Reactor at Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group in Petten, Netherlands. All major technetium-99m producing reactors were built in the 1960s and are close to the end of their lifetime. The two new Canadian Multipurpose Applied Physics Lattice Experiment reactors planned and built to produce 200% of the demand of technetium-99m relieved all other producers from building their own reactors. With the cancellation of the already tested reactors in 2008 the future supply of technetium-99m became very problematic.</p>\n<p>However the Chalk River reactor has been shut down for maintenance since August 2009, with an expected reopening in April 2010, and the Petten reactor had a 6-month scheduled maintenance shutdown beginning on Friday, February 19, 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply has left a gap, leaving some practitioners to revert to techniques not used for 20 years. Somewhat allaying this issue is an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate technetium. The reactor at Chalk River Laboratory reopened in August 2010 and the Petten reactor reopened September 2010.</p>\n<h3>Waste disposal</h3>\n<p>The long half-life of technetium-99 and its ability to form an anionic species makes it a major concern for long-term disposal of radioactive waste. Many of the processes designed to remove fission products in reprocessing plants aim at cationic species like caesium (e.g., caesium-137) and strontium (e.g., strontium-90). Hence the pertechnetate is able to escape through these treatment processes. Current disposal options favor burial in continental, geologically stable rock. The primary danger with such a course is that the waste is likely to come into contact with water, which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment. The anionic pertechnetate and iodide do not adsorb well onto the surfaces of minerals, so they are likely to be washed away. By comparison plutonium, uranium, and caesium are much more able to bind to soil particles. Technetium could also be immobilized by some environments, such as lake bottom sediments, due to microbial activity; for this reason, the environmental chemistry of technetium is an active area of research.</p>\n<p>An alternative disposal method, transmutation, has been demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. This transmutation process is one in which the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal target) is bombarded with neutrons to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16&nbsp;seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure technetium target is needed; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium are present in the target, they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374&nbsp;days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.</p>\n<p>The actual separation of technetium-99 from spent nuclear fuel is a long process. During fuel reprocessing, it appears in the waste liquid, which is highly radioactive. After sitting for several years, the radioactivity falls to a point where extraction of the long-lived isotopes, including technetium-99, becomes feasible. Several chemical extraction processes are then used, yielding technetium-99 metal of high purity.</p>\n<h3>Neutron activation</h3>\n<p>Molybdenum-99 can be formed by the neutron activation of molybdenum-98. Other technetium isotopes are not produced in significant quantities by fission; when needed, they are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes (for example, technetium-97 can be made by neutron irradiation of ruthenium-96).</p>\n<h3>Particle accelerators</h3>\n<p>The feasibility of technetium-99m production with the 22-MeV-proton bombardment of a molybdenum-100 target in medical cyclotrons following the reaction Mo(p,2n)Tc was demonstrated in 1971. The recent shortages of medical technetium-99m reignited the interest in its production by proton bombardment of isotopically-enriched (&gt;99.5%) molybdenum-100 targets. Other particle accelerator-based isotope production techniques have been investigated to obtain molybdenum-99 from molybdenum-100 via (n,2n) or (γ,n) reactions.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Nuclear medicine and biology</h3>\n<div>Main article: Technetium-99m</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTechnetium scintigraphy of a neck of Graves' disease patient</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Technetium-99m (\"m\" indicates that this is a metastable nuclear isomer) is used in radioactive isotope medical tests, for example as a radioactive tracer that medical equipment can detect in the human body. It is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable 140&nbsp;keV gamma rays, and its half-life is 6.01&nbsp;hours (meaning that about 94% of it decays to technetium-99 in 24&nbsp;hours). There are at least 31 commonly used radiopharmaceuticals based on technetium-99m for imaging and functional studies of the brain, myocardium, thyroid, lungs, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, skeleton, blood, and tumors.</p>\n<p>The longer-lived isotope technetium-95m, with a half-life of 61&nbsp;days, is used as a radioactive tracer to study the movement of technetium in the environment and in plant and animal systems.</p>\n<h3>Industrial and chemical</h3>\n<p>Technetium-99 decays almost entirely by beta decay, emitting beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard beta emitter, and is therefore used for equipment calibration. Technetium-99 has also been proposed for use in optoelectronic devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries.</p>\n<p>Like rhenium and palladium, technetium can serve as a catalyst. For some reactions, for example the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in finding safe catalytic applications.</p>\n<p>When steel is immersed in water, adding a small concentration (55&nbsp;ppm) of potassium pertechnetate(VII) to the water protects the steel from corrosion, even if the temperature is raised to 250&nbsp;°C. For this reason, pertechnetate has been used as a possible anodic corrosion inhibitor for steel, although technetium's radioactivity poses problems which limit this application to self-contained systems. While (for example) CrO2−\n4 can also inhibit corrosion, it requires a concentration ten times as high. In one experiment, a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20&nbsp;years and was still uncorroded. The mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood, but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer. One theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium dioxide which prevents further corrosion; the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water. (Activated carbon can also be used for the same effect.) The effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added.</p>\n<p>As noted, the radioactive nature of technetium (3&nbsp;MBq per liter at the concentrations required) makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations. Nevertheless, corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed (but never adopted) for use in boiling water reactors.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Technetium plays no natural biological role and is not normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15&nbsp;µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) is a function of compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.</p>\n<p>All isotopes of technetium must be handled carefully. The most common isotope, technetium-99, is a weak beta emitter; such radiation is stopped by the walls of laboratory glassware. The primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust; such radioactive contamination in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk. For most work, careful handling in a fume hood is sufficient; a glove box is not needed.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ In 1998 John T. Armstrong of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ran \"computer simulations\" of the 1925 experiments and obtained results quite close to those reported by the Noddack team. \"Using first-principles X-ray-emission spectral-generation algorithms developed at NIST, I simulated the X-ray spectra that would be expected for Van Assche's initial estimates of the Noddacks' residue compositions. The first results were surprisingly close to their published spectrum! Over the next couple of years, we refined our reconstruction of their analytical methods and performed more sophisticated simulations. The agreement between simulated and reported spectra improved further. Our calculation of the amount of element&nbsp;43 required to produce their spectrum is quite similar to the direct measurements of natural technetium abundance in uranium ore published in 1999 by Dave Curtis and colleagues at Los Alamos. We can find no other plausible explanation for the Noddacks' data than that they did indeed detect fission \"masurium.\"\nArmstrong, J. T. (2003). \"Technetium\".

  "title": "Ruthenium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Ruthenium</b> is a chemical element with symbol <b>Ru</b> and atomic number 44. It is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most chemicals. The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after Ruthenia, the Latin word for Rus'. Ruthenium usually occurs as a minor component of platinum ores and its annual production is only about 20 tonnes. Most ruthenium is used for wear-resistant electrical contacts and the production of thick-film resistors. A minor application of ruthenium is its use in some platinum alloys.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHalf of a pure, electron-beam remelted ruthenium bar</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A polyvalent hard white metal, ruthenium is a member of the platinum group and is in group 8 of the periodic table:</p>\n\n<p>However, it has an atypical configuration in its outermost electron shells: whereas all other group 8 elements have 2 electrons in the outermost shell, in ruthenium, one of those is transferred to a lower shell. This effect can be observed in the neighboring metals niobium (41), rhodium (45), and palladium (46).</p>\n<p>Ruthenium has four crystal modifications and does not tarnish unless subject to high temperatures. Ruthenium dissolves in fused alkalis, is not attacked by acids but is attacked by halogens at high temperatures. Small amounts of ruthenium can increase the hardness of platinum and palladium. The corrosion resistance of titanium is increased markedly by the addition of a small amount of ruthenium. The metal can be plated either by electroplating or by thermal decomposition methods. A ruthenium-molybdenum alloy is known to be superconductive at temperatures below 10.6 K.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of ruthenium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring ruthenium is composed of seven stable isotopes. Additionally, 34 radioactive isotopes have been discovered. Of these radioisotopes, the most stable are Ru with a half-life of 373.59 days, Ru with a half-life of 39.26 days and Ru with a half-life of 2.9 days.</p>\n<p>Fifteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 89.93 u (Ru) to 114.928 u (Ru). Most of these have half-lives that are less than five minutes except Ru (half-life: 1.643 hours) and Ru (half-life: 4.44 hours).</p>\n<p>The primary decay mode before the most abundant isotope, Ru, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay product before Ru is technetium and the primary decay product after is rhodium.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also: category:Ruthenium minerals</div>\n<p>Ruthenium is exceedingly rare, only the 74th most abundant metal on Earth. This element is generally found in ores with the other platinum group metals in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. Small but commercially important quantities are also found in pentlandite extracted from Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, and in pyroxenite deposits in South Africa. The native form of ruthenium is a very rare mineral (Ir replaces part of Ru in its structure).</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<h3>Mining</h3>\n<p>Roughly 12 tonnes of ruthenium is mined each year with world reserves estimated as 5,000 tonnes. The composition of the mined platinum group metal (PGM) mixtures varies in a wide range depending on the geochemical formation. For example, the PGMs mined in South Africa contain on average 11% ruthenium while the PGMs mined in the former USSR contain only 2% based on research dating from 1992.</p>\n<p>Ruthenium, like the other platinum group metals, is obtained commercially as a by-product from nickel and copper mining and processing as well as by the processing of platinum group metal ores. During electrorefining of copper and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals settle to the bottom of the cell as <i>anode mud</i>, which forms the starting point for their extraction. To separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid. Osmium, ruthenium, rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum and gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia, leaving a solid residue. Rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate. The insoluble residue, containing Ru, Os and Ir is treated with sodium oxide, in which Ir is insoluble, producing water-soluble Ru and Os salts. After oxidation to the volatile oxides, RuO\n4 is separated from OsO\n4 by precipitation of (NH)RuCl with ammonium chloride or by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. Hydrogen is used to reduce ammonium ruthenium chloride yielding a powder. The first method to precipitate the ruthenium with ammonium chloride is similar to the procedure that Smithson Tennant and William Hyde Wollaston used for their separation. Several methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques or by argon-arc welding.</p>\n<h3>From used nuclear fuels</h3>\n<div>Main article: Synthesis of precious metals</div>\n<p>Fission products of uranium-235 contain significant amounts of ruthenium and the lighter platinum group metals and therefore used nuclear fuel might be a possible source of ruthenium. The complicated extraction is expensive and the radioactive isotopes of ruthenium that are present would make storage for several half-lives of the decaying isotopes necessary. This makes this source of ruthenium unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been started.</p>\n<h2>Chemical compounds</h2>\n<div>See also: Category:Ruthenium compounds</div>\n<p>The oxidation states of ruthenium range from 0 to +8, and −2. The properties of ruthenium and osmium compounds are often similar. The +2, +3, and +4 states are the most common. The most prevalent precursor is ruthenium trichloride, a red solid that is poorly defined chemically but versatile synthetically.</p>\n<h3>Oxides</h3>\n<p>Ruthenium can be oxidized to ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO, oxidation state +4) which can in turn be oxidized by sodium metaperiodate to ruthenium tetroxide, RuO, a strong oxidizing agent with structure and properties analogous to osmium tetroxide. Like osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide is a potent fixative and stain for electron microscopy of organic materials, and is mostly used to reveal the structure of polymer samples. Dipotassium ruthenate (KRuO, +6), and potassium perruthenate (KRuO, +7) are also known.</p>\n<h3>Coordination and organometallic complexes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organoruthenium chemistry</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Ruthenium forms a variety of coordination complexes. Examples are the many pentammine derivatives [Ru(NH)L] which often exist in both Ru(II) and Ru(III). Derivatives of bipyridine and terpyridine are numerous, best known being the luminescent tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride.</p>\n<p>Ruthenium form a wide range compounds with carbon-ruthenium bonds. Ruthenocene is analogous to ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. A large number of complexes of carbon monoxide are known, the parent being triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. The analogue of iron pentacarbonyl, ruthenium pentacarbonyl is unstable at ambient conditions. Ruthenium trichloride carbonylates (reacts with carbon monoxide) to give mono- and diruthenium(II) carbonyls from which many derivatives have been prepared such as RuHCl(CO)(PPh) and Ru(CO)(PPh) (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride (RuCl(PPh)), which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh)).</p>\n<p>In the area of fine chemical synthesis, Grubbs' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis.</p>\n<h3>Ruthenides</h3>\n<p>Metal ruthenides (Ru) are very rare, but are commonly found in superconductor applications, especially with regard to lanthanide metals e.g. cerium ruthenide (CeRu).</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Though naturally occurring platinum alloys containing all six platinum group metals were used for a long time by pre-Columbian Americans and known as a material to European chemists from the mid-16th century, it took until the mid-18th century for platinum to be identified as a pure element. The discovery that natural platinum contained palladium, rhodium, osmium and iridium occurred in the first decade of the 19th century. Platinum in alluvial sands of Russian rivers gave access to raw material for use in plates and medals and for the minting of ruble coins, starting in 1828. Residues of platinum production for minting were available in the Russian Empire, and therefore most of the research on them was done in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the Polish chemist Jędrzej Śniadecki isolated element 44 (which he called \"vestium\") from platinum ores in 1807. He published an announcement of his discovery in the Polish language in article \"Rosprawa o nowym metallu w surowey platynie odkrytym\" in 1808. His work was never confirmed, however, and he later withdrew his claim of discovery. Jöns Berzelius and Gottfried Osann nearly discovered ruthenium in 1827. They examined residues that were left after dissolving crude platinum from the Ural Mountains in aqua regia. Berzelius did not find any unusual metals, but Osann thought he found three new metals, pluranium, ruthenium and polinium. This discrepancy led to a long-standing controversy between Berzelius and Osann about the composition of the residues.</p>\n<p>In 1844, the Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus showed that the compounds prepared by Gottfried Osann contained small amounts of ruthenium, which Claus had discovered the same year. Claus isolated ruthenium from the platinum residues of the rouble production while he was working in Kazan University, Kazan. Claus showed that ruthenium oxide contained a new metal and obtained 6&nbsp;grams of ruthenium from the part of crude platinum that is insoluble in aqua regia.</p>\n<p>The name itself derives from Ruthenia, the Latin word for Rus', a historical area which includes present-day western Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of Slovakia and Poland. Claus used the name proposed by Gottfried Osann in 1828, who had chosen the element's name in honor of his birthland, as he was born in Tartu, Estonia, which was at the time a part of the Russian Empire.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Because of its ability to harden platinum and palladium, ruthenium is used in platinum and palladium alloys to make wear-resistant electrical contacts. In this application, only thin plated films are used to achieve the necessary wear-resistance. Because of its lower cost and similar properties compared to rhodium, the use as plating material for electric contacts is one of the major applications. The thin coatings are either applied by electroplating or sputtering.</p>\n<p>Ruthenium dioxide and lead and bismuth ruthenates are used in thick-film chip resistors. These two electronic applications account for 50% of the ruthenium consumption.</p>\n<p>Only a few ruthenium alloys are used other than those with other platinum group metals. Ruthenium is often used in small quantities in those alloys to improve some of their properties. The beneficial effect on the corrosion resistance of titanium alloys led to the development of a special alloy containing 0.1% ruthenium. Ruthenium is also used in some advanced high-temperature single-crystal superalloys, with applications including the turbine blades in jet engines. Several nickel based superalloy compositions are described in the literature. Among them are EPM-102 (with 3% Ru) and TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), as well as TMS-138 and TMS-174. both containing 6% rhenium. Fountain pen nibs are frequently tipped with alloys containing ruthenium. From 1944 onward, the famous Parker 51 fountain pen was fitted with the \"RU\" nib, a 14K gold nib tipped with 96.2% ruthenium and 3.8% iridium.</p>\n<p>Ruthenium is a component of mixed-metal oxide (MMO) anodes used for cathodic protection of underground and submerged structures, and for electrolytic cells for chemical processes such as generating chlorine from salt water. The fluorescence of some ruthenium complexes is quenched by oxygen, which has led to their use as optode sensors for oxygen. Ruthenium red, [(NH)Ru-O-Ru(NH)-O-Ru(NH)], is a biological stain used to stain polyanionic molecules such as pectin and nucleic acids for light microscopy and electron microscopy. The beta-decaying isotope 106 of ruthenium is used in radiotherapy of eye tumors, mainly malignant melanomas of the uvea. Ruthenium-centered complexes are being researched for possible anticancer properties. Compared with platinum complexes, those of ruthenium show greater resistance to hydrolysis and more selective action on tumors. NAMI-A and KP1019 are two drugs undergoing clinical evaluation against metastatic tumors and colon cancers.</p>\n<h3>Catalysis</h3>\n<p>Ruthenium is a versatile catalyst. Hydrogen sulfide can be split by light by using an aqueous suspension of CdS particles loaded with ruthenium dioxide. This may be useful in the removal of HS in oil refineries and other industrial processing facilities. Organometallic ruthenium carbene and alkylidene complexes have been found to be highly efficient catalysts for olefin metathesis, a process with important applications in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry.</p>\n<h3>Solar energy conversion</h3>\n<p>Some ruthenium complexes absorb light throughout the visible spectrum and are being actively researched in various, potential, solar energy technologies. For example, Ruthenium-based compounds have been used for light absorption in dye-sensitized solar cells, a promising new low-cost solar cell system.</p>\n<h3>Data storage</h3>\n<p>Chemical vapor deposition of ruthenium is used as a method to produce thin films of pure ruthenium on substrates. These films show promising properties for the use in microchips and for the giant magnetoresistive read element for hard disk drives. Ruthenium was also suggested as a possible material for microelectronics because its use is compatible with semiconductor processing techniques.</p>\n<h3>Exotic materials</h3>\n<p>Many ruthenium based oxides show very unusual properties, such as a quantum critical point behavior, exotic superconductivity, and high temperature ferromagnetism.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ \"Ruthenium: ruthenium(I) fluoride compound data\".

  "title": "Rhodium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Rhodium</b> is a chemical element that is a rare, silvery-white, hard, and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group. It has the chemical symbol <b>Rh</b> and atomic number 45. It is composed of only one naturally-occurring isotope, Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals.</p>\n<p>Rhodium is a so-called noble metal, resistant to corrosion, found in platinum- or nickel ores together with the other members of the platinum group metals. It was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston in one such ore, and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds, produced after it reacted with the powerful acid mixture aqua regia.</p>\n<p>The element's major use (more than 80% of world rhodium production) is as one of the catalysts in the three-way catalytic converters in automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. White gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium plated for tarnish resistance.</p>\n<p>Also, rhodium detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure the neutron flux level.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWilliam Hyde Wollaston</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Rhodium (Greek <i>rhodon</i> (ῥόδον) meaning \"rose\") was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, soon after his discovery of palladium. He used crude platinum ore presumably obtained from South America. His procedure involved dissolving the ore in aqua regia and neutralizing the acid with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). He then precipitated the platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate by adding ammonium chloride, NH\n4Cl. Most other metals like copper, lead, palladium and rhodium were precipitated with zinc. Diluted nitric acid dissolved all but palladium and rhodium, which were dissolved in aqua regia, and the rhodium was precipitated by the addition of sodium chloride as Na\n3[RhCl\n6]·nH\n2O. After being washed with ethanol, the rose-red precipitate was reacted with zinc, which displaced the rhodium in the ionic compound and thereby released the rhodium as free metal.</p>\n<p>After the discovery the rare element had only minor applications, for example by the turn of the century rhodium-containing thermocouples were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion resistant coating. The introduction of the three way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium while the three way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n\n<p>Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable metal that has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not normally form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWilkinson's catalyst</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Rhodium belongs to group 9 of the periodic table but has an atypical configuration in its outermost electron shells compared to the rest of the members. This can also be observed in the neighborhood of niobium (41), ruthenium (44), and palladium (46).</p>\n\n<p>The common oxidation state of rhodium is +3, but oxidation states from +0 to +6 are also observed.</p>\n<p>Unlike ruthenium and osmium, rhodium forms no volatile oxygen compounds. The known stable oxides include Rh\n2O\n3, RhO\n2, RhO\n2·xH\n2O, Na\n2RhO\n3, Sr\n3LiRhO\n6 and Sr\n3NaRhO\n6. Halogen compounds are known in nearly the full range of possible oxidation states. Rhodium(III) chloride, rhodium(IV) fluoride, rhodium(V) fluoride and rhodium(VI) fluoride are some examples. The lower oxidation states are only stable if ligands are present.</p>\n<p>The best-known rhodium-halogen compound is the Wilkinson's catalyst chlorotris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium(I). This catalyst is used, for example, in the hydroformylation or hydrogenation of alkenes.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of rhodium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring rhodium is composed of only one isotope, Rh. The most stable radioisotopes are Rh with a half-life of 3.3 years, Rh with a half-life of 207 days, Rh with a half-life of 2.9 years, and Rh with a half-life of 16.1 days. Twenty other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 92.926 u (Rh) to 116.925 u (Rh). Most of these have half-lives shorter than an hour, except Rh (half-life: 20.8 hours) and Rh (half-life: 35.36 hours). There are also numerous meta states, the most stable being Rh (0.141 MeV) with a half-life of about 2.9 years and Rh (0.157 MeV) with a half-life of 4.34 days (see isotopes of rhodium).</p>\n<p>The primary decay mode before the only stable isotope, Rh, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay product before Rh is ruthenium and the primary product after is palladium.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<p>Rhodium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust, of which it comprises an estimated 0.0002 parts per million (2 × 10). Its rarity affects its price, and thus its usage in commercial applications.</p>\n<h3>Mining and price</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRh price evolution.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The industrial extraction of rhodium is complex as the metal occurs in ores mixed with other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal which is very difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa, in river sands of the Ural Mountains, and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.<br></p>\n<p>The main exporter of rhodium is South Africa (approximately 80% in 2010) followed by Russia. The annual world production of this element is less than 30 tonnes and there are very few rhodium-bearing minerals. The price of rhodium is historically highly variable. In 2007, rhodium cost approximately eight times more than gold, 450 times more than silver, and 27,250 times more than copper by weight. In 2008, the price briefly rose above $10,000 per ounce. The economic slowdown of the 3rd quarter of 2008 pushed rhodium prices sharply back below $1,000 per ounce, but they rebounded to $2,750 by early 2010 (over twice the gold price).</p>\n<h3>Used nuclear fuels</h3>\n<div>Main article: Synthesis of precious metals</div>\n<p>Rhodium is a fission product of uranium-235; therefore, each kilogram of fission products contains significant amounts of the lighter platinum group metals including rhodium. Used nuclear fuel might be a possible source for rhodium. However, the extraction is complex and expensive, and the also present radioactive isotopes of rhodium would require a storage for several half-lives of the longest-lived decaying isotope (i.e. about 10 years) to reduce the radioactivity. This makes this source of rhodium unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been attempted.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>The primary use of this element is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which changes harmful unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions from the engine into less noxious gases. Of 27,200&nbsp;kg of rhodium consumed worldwide in 2010, some 22,500&nbsp;kg (82.7%) went into and 7,300&nbsp;kg recovered from this application. About 1,770&nbsp;kg of rhodium was used in the glass industry, mostly for production of fiberglass and flat-panel glass, and 2,110&nbsp;kg in the chemical industry.</p>\n<h3>Catalyst</h3>\n<p>In 2010, more than 80% of the world production of rhodium was consumed to produce three-way catalytic converters. Rhodium shows some advantages over the other platinum metals in the reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 NO\nx → <i>x</i> O\n2 + N\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Rhodium-based catalysts are used in a number of industrial processes; notably, in the automobile catalytic converters and for catalytic carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid by the Monsanto process. It is also used to catalyze addition of hydrosilanes to molecular double bonds, a process important in manufacture of certain silicone rubbers. Rhodium catalysts are also used to reduce benzene to cyclohexane.</p>\n<p>The complex of a rhodium ion with BINAP gives a widely used chiral catalyst for chiral synthesis, as in the synthesis of menthol.</p>\n<h3>Ornamental uses</h3>\n<p>Rhodium finds use in jewelry and for decorations. It is electroplated on white gold and platinum to give it a reflective white surface. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish, which is silver sulfide (AgS) produced from the atmospheric hydrogen sulfide (HS). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, because the metal has both high melting point and poor malleability (making such jewelry very hard to fabricate) rather than due to its high price. Additionally, its high cost assures that most of its jewelry usage is in the form of tiny amounts of powder (commonly called rhodium sponge) dissolved into electroplating solutions.</p>\n<p>Rhodium has also been used for honors or to symbolize wealth, when more commonly used metals such as silver, gold, or platinum are deemed insufficient. In 1979, the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> gave Paul McCartney a rhodium-plated disc for being history's all-time best-selling songwriter and recording artist.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>Rhodium is used as an alloying agent for hardening and improving the corrosion resistance of platinum and palladium. These alloys are used in furnace windings, bushings for glass fiber production, thermocouple elements, electrodes for aircraft spark plugs, and laboratory crucibles. Other uses include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An electrical contact material due to its low electrical resistance, low and stable contact resistance, and high corrosion resistance.</li>\n<li>Plated rhodium, made by electroplating or evaporation, is extremely hard and is used for optical instruments.</li>\n<li>It is also used as a filter in mammography systems because of the characteristic X-rays it produces.</li>\n<li>Rhodium neutron detectors are used in combustion engineering nuclear reactors to measure neutron flux levels – a method that requires a digital filter to determine the current neutron flux level, as there are three signals generated: immediate, a few seconds later, and a minute later, each with its own signal level, and all three are combined in the rhodium detector signals. The three Palo Verde nuclear reactors each have 305 rhodium neutron detectors, 61 detectors on each of five vertical levels, providing an accurate 3D \"picture\" of reactivity and allowing fine tuning to most economically burn the nuclear fuel.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>A 78 g sample of rhodium</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Cross section of a metal-core catalytic converter</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Rhodium-plated white gold wedding ring</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Rhodium foil and wire</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Being a noble metal, pure rhodium is inert. However, chemical complexes of rhodium can be reactive. Median lethal dose (LD) for rats is 198&nbsp;mg of rhodium chloride (RhCl\n3) per kilogram of body weight. Rhodium compounds can strongly stain human skin. Like the other noble metals, all of which are too inert to occur as chemical compounds in nature, rhodium has not been found to play, or suspected to play, any biological role. If used in elemental form rather than as compounds, the metal is harmless.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Rhodium compounds</li>\n<li>2000s commodities boom</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ \"Rhodium: rhodium(I) fluoride compound data\".

  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Palladium (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<div></div>\n<p><b>Palladium</b> is a chemical element with the chemical symbol <b>Pd</b> and an atomic number of 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs). These have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.</p>\n<p>Over half of the supply of palladium and its congener platinum goes into catalytic converters, which convert up to 90% of harmful gases from auto exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into less-harmful substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor). Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, groundwater treatment and jewelry. Palladium plays a key role in the technology used for fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.</p>\n<p>Ore deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare, and the most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa, the Stillwater Complex in Montana, United States, the Thunder Bay District of Ontario, Canada, and the Norilsk Complex in Russia. Recycling is also a source of palladium, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited supply sources of palladium result in the metal attracting considerable investment interest.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Palladium belongs to group&nbsp;10 in the periodic table:</p>\n\n<p>but has a very atypical configuration in its outermost electron shells compared to the other members of group 10 (see also niobium (41), ruthenium (44), and rhodium (45)), having fewer filled electron shells than the elements directly preceding it (a phenomenon unique to palladium).</p>\n<p>Palladium is a soft silver-white metal that resembles platinum. It is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and greatly increases its strength and hardness when it is cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and, when finely divided, in hydrochloric acid.</p>\n<p>Common oxidation states of palladium are 0, +1, +2 and&nbsp;+4. Although originally +3 was thought of as one of the fundamental oxidation states of palladium, there is no evidence for palladium occurring in the +3 oxidation state; this has been investigated via X-ray diffraction for a number of compounds, indicating a dimer of palladium(II) and palladium(IV) instead. In 2002, palladium(VI) was first reported.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of palladium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring palladium is composed of seven isotopes, which includes six stable isotopes. The most stable radioisotopes are Pd with a half-life of 6.5 million years (found in nature), Pd with a half-life of 17 days, and Pd with a half-life of 3.63 days. Eighteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 90.94948(64) u (Pd) to 122.93426(64) u (Pd). Most of these have half-lives that are less than thirty minutes, except Pd (half-life: 8.47 hours), Pd (half-life: 13.7 hours), and Pd (half-life: 21 hours).</p>\n<p>For isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope, Pd, the primary decay mode is electron capture with the primary decay product being rhodium. The primary mode of decay for those isotopes of Pd with atomic mass greater than 106 is beta decay with the primary product of this decay being silver.</p>\n<p>Radiogenic Ag is a decay product of Pd and was first discovered in 1978 in the Santa Clara meteorite of 1976. The discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of iron-cored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event. Pd versus Ag correlations observed in bodies, which have been melted since accretion of the solar system, must reflect the presence of short-lived nuclides in the early solar system.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>See also category: Palladium compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPalladium(II) oxide forms on the surface of palladium when heated above 800°C in air</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPalladium(II) chloride</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Palladium does not react with oxygen at normal temperatures (and thus does not tarnish in air). Palladium heated to 800°C will produce a layer of palladium(II) oxide (PdO). It lightly tarnishes in moist atmosphere containing sulfur.Palladium primarily exists in the 0, +2, +4 oxidation states; the +4 oxidation state is comparatively rare. One major example of palladium(IV) is hexachloropalladate(IV), [PdCl].</p>\n<p>Elemental palladium reacts with chlorine to give palladium(II) chloride; it dissolves in nitric acid and precipitates palladium(II) acetate on addition of acetic acid. These two compounds and the bromide are reactive and relatively inexpensive, making them convenient entry points to palladium chemistry. All three are not monomeric; the chloride and bromide often must be refluxed in acetonitrile to obtain the more reactive acetonitrile complex monomers, for example:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>PdX + 2 MeCN → PdX(MeCN) (X = Cl, Br)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Palladium(II) chloride is the principal starting material for many other palladium catalysts. It is used to prepare heterogeneous palladium catalysts: palladium on barium sulfate, palladium on carbon, and palladium chloride on carbon. It reacts with triphenylphosphine in coordinating solvents to give bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride, a useful catalyst. Where desired, the catalyst may be formed <i>in situ</i>.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>PdCl + 2 PPh → PdCl(PPh)</dd>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPalladium(II) acetate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Reduction of this phosphine complex with hydrazine with more phosphine gives tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), one of the two major palladium(0) complexes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 PdCl(PPh) + 4 PPh + 5 NH → 2 Pd(PPh) + N + 4 NHCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The other major palladium(0) complex, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd(dba)), is prepared by reducing sodium tetrachloropalladate in the presence of dibenzylideneacetone.</p>\n<p>The great many reactions in which palladium compounds serve as catalysts are collectively known as palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions. Prominent examples include the Heck, Suzuki and Stille reactions. Palladium(II) acetate, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh), and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd(dba)) are useful in this regard, either as catalysts or as starting points to catalysts.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWilliam Hyde Wollaston</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>William Hyde Wollaston noted the discovery of a new noble metal in July 1802 in his lab-book and named it palladium in August of the same year. Wollaston purified enough of the material and offered it, without naming the discoverer, in a small shop in Soho in April 1803. After harsh criticism that palladium is an alloy of platinum and mercury by Richard Chenevix, Wollaston anonymously offered a reward of 20 British pounds for 20 grains of synthetic palladium <i>alloy</i>. Chenevix received the Copley Medal in 1803 after he published his experiments on palladium. Wollaston published the discovery of rhodium in 1804 and mentions some of his work on palladium. He disclosed that he was the discoverer of palladium in a publication in 1805.</p>\n<p>It was named by Wollaston in 1802 after the asteroid Pallas, which had been discovered two months earlier. Wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from South America by dissolving the ore in aqua regia, neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide, and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride. He added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium cyanide, which was heated to extract palladium metal.</p>\n<p>Palladium chloride was at one time prescribed as a tuberculosis treatment at the rate of 0.065 g per day (approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight). This treatment had many negative side-effects, and was later replaced by more effective drugs.</p>\n<p>In the run up to 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because the export quota was not granted on time, for political reasons. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around this time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing auto vehicle production disruption due to a possible palladium shortage, stockpiled large amounts of the metal purchased near the price high. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1&nbsp;billion. World demand for palladium increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300&nbsp;tons in 2000. The global production of palladium from mines was 222&nbsp;tonnes in 2006 according to the United States Geological Survey. Most palladium is used for catalytic converters in the automobile industry.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPalladium output in 2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 2007, Russia was the top producer of palladium, with a 44% world share, followed by South Africa with 40%. Canada with 6% and the U.S. with 5% are the only other substantial producers of palladium.</p>\n<p>Palladium can be found as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinum-group metals in placer deposits of the Ural Mountains, Australia, Ethiopia, North and South America. For the production of palladium these deposits play only a minor role. The most important commercial sources are nickel-copper deposits found in the Sudbury Basin, Ontario, and the Norilsk–Talnakh deposits in Siberia. The other large deposit is the Merensky Reef platinum group metals deposit within the Bushveld Igneous Complex South Africa. The Stillwater igneous complex of Montana and the Roby zone ore body of the Lac des Îles igneous complex of Ontario are the two other sources of palladium in Canada and the United States. Palladium is found in the rare minerals cooperite and polarite.</p>\n<p>Palladium is also produced in nuclear fission reactors and can be extracted from spent nuclear fuel (see synthesis of precious metals) though this source for palladium is not used. None of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract palladium from the high-level radioactive waste.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCross section of a metal-core catalytic converter</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Soviet 25-rouble commemorative palladium coin is a rare example of the monetary usage of palladium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The largest use of palladium today is in catalytic converters. Palladium is also used in jewelry, in dentistry, watch making, in blood sugar test strips, in aircraft spark plugs and in the production of surgical instruments and electrical contacts. Palladium is also used to make professional transverse flutes. As a commodity, palladium bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and 964. Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum.</p>\n<h3>Catalysis</h3>\n<p>When it is finely divided, such as in palladium on carbon, palladium forms a versatile catalyst and speeds up hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, as well as in petroleum cracking. A large number of carbon-carbon bond forming reactions in organic chemistry (such as the Heck reaction and Suzuki coupling) are facilitated by catalysis with palladium compounds. (see Palladium Compounds and palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions) In addition, palladium, when dispersed on conductive materials, proves to be an excellent electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media. In 2010, palladium-catalysed organic reactions were recognised by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Palladium is also a versatile metal for homogeneous catalysis. It is used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations. A 2008 study showed that palladium is an effective catalyst for making carbon-fluoride bonds. Palladium is found in the Lindlar catalyst, also called Lindlar's Palladium.</p>\n<h3>Electronics</h3>\n<p>The second-biggest application of palladium in electronics is in the manufacture of multilayer ceramic capacitors, in which palladium (and palladium-silver alloys) are used as electrodes. Palladium (sometimes alloyed with nickel) is used in connector platings in consumer electronics.</p>\n<p>It is also used in plating of electronic components and in soldering materials. The electronic sector consumed 1.07&nbsp;million troy ounces (33.2&nbsp;tonnes) of palladium in 2006, according to a Johnson Matthey report.</p>\n<h3>Technology</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPalladium-based sorbents are efficient in removing mercury from industrial gases.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium; thus, it provides a means of purifying the gas. Membrane reactors with Pd membranes are therefore used for the production of high purity hydrogen. Palladium is a part of the palladium-hydrogen electrode in electrochemical studies. Palladium(II) chloride can oxidize large amounts of carbon monoxide gas, and is used in carbon monoxide detectors.</p>\n<h3>Hydrogen storage</h3>\n<div>Main article: Palladium hydride</div>\n<p>Palladium readily absorbs hydrogen at room temperatures forming palladium hydride PdH with x below 1. While this property is common to many transition metals, palladium is unique by the high absorption capacity and by that it does not lose its ductility until high x values. This property has been investigated for designing an efficient, yet inexpensive hydrogen storage material (palladium itself is prohibitively expensive for this purpose).<br></p>\n<h3>Jewelry</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA palladium-plated belt buckle</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Palladium itself has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since 1939, as an alternative to platinum for making white gold. This use resulted from the naturally white color of palladium, which required no rhodium plating. Palladium is proportionally much lighter than platinum. Similar to gold, palladium can be beaten into a thin leaf form as thin as 100&nbsp;nm (1/250,000&nbsp;in). Unlike platinum, palladium may discolor upon heating to above 400 °C (752&nbsp;°F); it is relatively brittle and reacts with strong acids such as nitric acid.</p>\n<p>Palladium is one of the three most popular metals used to make white gold alloys (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is a more expensive alloy than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).</p>\n<p>When platinum was declared a strategic government resource during World War II, many jewelry bands were made out of palladium. As recently as September 2001, palladium was more expensive than platinum and rarely used in jewelry also due to the technical obstacle of casting. However, the casting problem has been resolved and its use in jewelry has increased because of a large spike in the price of platinum and a drop in the price of palladium.</p>\n<p>Prior to 2004, the principal use of palladium in jewelry was the manufacture of white gold. In early 2004, when gold and platinum prices rose steeply, China began fabricating significant volumes of palladium jewelry and used 37 tonnes of palladium for this purpose in 2005. Changes of the relative price between palladium and platinum after 2008 lowered demand for palladium to 17.4 tonnes in 2009.</p>\n<p>In January 2010, hallmarks for palladium were introduced by assay offices in the United Kingdom, and it became a legal requirement to hallmark all articles of jewellery described as being wholly or partly made of palladium. Articles can be marked as containing a minimum of either 500, 950 or 999 parts per thousand of palladium.</p>\n<h3>Photography</h3>\n<p>With the platinotype printing process photographers make fine-art black-and-white prints using platinum or palladium salts. Often used with platinum, palladium provides an alternative to silver.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Finely divided palladium metal can be pyrophoric. As a platinum-group metal, the bulk material is quite inert. Although contact dermatitis has been reported, the amount of data on the effects of exposure to palladium is limited. It has been shown that people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel, making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic.</p>\n<p>A considerable amount of palladium is distributed by the exhausts of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108&nbsp;ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars. Its total uptake from food is estimated to be lower than 2&nbsp;µg per person a day. The second possible source for palladium is alloys for dental restoration, there the possible uptake of palladium is estimated to be lower than 15&nbsp;µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably higher uptake. For soluble compounds like palladium chloride 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.</p>\n<p>The median lethal dose (LD) of soluble palladium compounds in mice is 200&nbsp;mg/kg for oral and 5&nbsp;mg/kg for intravenous administration.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>2000s commodities boom</li>\n<li>Palladium as an investment</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Lide, D.

  "title": "Silver",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For the color, see Silver (color).  For other uses, see Silver (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Silver</b> is a chemical element with the chemical symbol <b>Ag</b> (Greek: άργυρος <i>árguros</i>, Latin: argentum, both from the Indo-European root <i>*arg-</i> for \"grey\" or \"shining\") and atomic number 47. A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it possesses the highest electrical conductivity of any element and the highest thermal conductivity of any metal. The metal occurs naturally in its pure, free form (native silver), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining.</p>\n<p>Silver has long been valued as a precious metal, used in currency coins, to make ornaments, jewelry, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term silverware) and as an investment in the forms of coins and bullion. Silver metal is used industrially in electrical contacts and conductors, in mirrors and in catalysis of chemical reactions. Its compounds are used in photographic film and dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect). While many medical antimicrobial uses of silver have been supplanted by antibiotics, further research into clinical potential continues.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSilver 1000&nbsp;oz t (~31&nbsp;kg) bullion bar</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Silver is a very ductile, malleable (slightly harder than gold), monovalent coinage metal, with a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high degree of polish. It has the highest electrical conductivity of all metals, even higher than copper, but its greater cost has prevented it from being widely used in place of copper for electrical purposes. An exception to this is in radio-frequency engineering, particularly at VHF and higher frequencies, where silver plating to improve electrical conductivity of parts, including wires, is widely employed. During World War II in the US, 13,540&nbsp;tons were used in the electromagnets used for enriching uranium, mainly because of the wartime shortage of copper.</p>\n<p>Among metals, pure silver has the highest thermal conductivity (the nonmetal carbon in the form of diamond and superfluid helium II are higher) and one of the highest optical reflectivities. (Aluminium slightly outdoes silver in parts of the visible spectrum, and silver is a poor reflector of ultraviolet). Silver is the best conductor of heat and electricity of any metal on the periodic table. Silver also has the lowest contact resistance of any metal. Silver halides are photosensitive and are remarkable for their ability to record a latent image that can later be developed chemically. Silver is stable in pure air and water, but tarnishes when it is exposed to air or water containing ozone or hydrogen sulfide, the latter forming a black layer of silver sulfide which can be cleaned off with dilute hydrochloric acid. The most common oxidation state of silver is +1 (for example, silver nitrate, AgNO); the less common +2 compounds (for example, silver(II) fluoride, AgF), and the even less common +3 (for example, potassium tetrafluoroargentate(III), KAgF) and even +4 compounds (for example, potassium hexafluoroargentate(IV), KAgF) are also known.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of silver</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring silver is composed of two stable isotopes, Ag and Ag, with Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). Silver's isotopes are almost equal in abundance, something which is rare in the periodic table. Silver's atomic weight is 107.8682(2) g/mol. Twenty-eight radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being Ag with a half-life of 41.29&nbsp;days, Ag with a half-life of 7.45&nbsp;days, and Ag with a half-life of 3.13&nbsp;hours. This element has numerous meta states, the most stable being Ag (<i>t</i> = 418&nbsp;years), Ag (<i>t</i> = 249.79&nbsp;days) and Ag (<i>t</i> = 8.28&nbsp;days). All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than an hour, and the majority of these have half-lives of less than three minutes.</p>\n<p>Isotopes of silver range in relative atomic mass from 93.943 (Ag) to 126.936 (Ag); the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, Ag, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay. The primary decay products before Ag are palladium (element 46) isotopes, and the primary products after are cadmium (element 48) isotopes.</p>\n<p>The palladium isotope Pd decays by beta emission to Ag with a half-life of 6.5&nbsp;million years. Iron meteorites are the only objects with a high-enough palladium-to-silver ratio to yield measurable variations in Ag abundance. Radiogenic Ag was first discovered in the Santa Clara meteorite in 1978. The discoverers suggest the coalescence and differentiation of iron-cored small planets may have occurred 10&nbsp;million years after a nucleosynthetic event. Pd–Ag correlations observed in bodies that have clearly been melted since the accretion of the solar system must reflect the presence of unstable nuclides in the early solar system.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<p>Silver metal dissolves readily in nitric acid (HNO\n3) to produce silver nitrate (AgNO\n3), a transparent crystalline solid that is photosensitive and readily soluble in water. Silver nitrate is used as the starting point for the synthesis of many other silver compounds, as an antiseptic, and as a yellow stain for glass in stained glass. Silver metal does not react with sulfuric acid, which is used in jewelry-making to clean and remove copper oxide firescale from silver articles after silver soldering or annealing. Silver reacts readily with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide H\n2S to produce silver sulfide, a dark-colored compound familiar as the tarnish on silver coins and other objects. Silver sulfide Ag\n2S also forms silver whiskers when silver electrical contacts are used in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen sulfide.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Ag + O + 2 HS → 2 AgS + 2 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCessna&nbsp;210 equipped with a silver iodide generator for cloud seeding</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Silver chloride (AgCl) is precipitated from solutions of silver nitrate in the presence of chloride ions, and the other silver halides used in the manufacture of photographic emulsions are made in the same way, using bromide or iodide salts. Silver chloride is used in glass electrodes for pH testing and potentiometric measurement, and as a transparent cement for glass. Silver iodide has been used in attempts to seed clouds to produce rain. Silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are used in gravimetric analytical methods.</p>\n<p>Silver oxide (Ag\n2O), produced when silver nitrate solutions are treated with a base, is used as a positive electrode (anode) in watch batteries. Silver carbonate (Ag\n2CO\n3) is precipitated when silver nitrate is treated with sodium carbonate (Na\n2CO\n3).</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 AgNO + 2 OH → AgO + HO + 2 NO</dd>\n<dd>2 AgNO + NaCO → AgCO + 2 NaNO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Silver fulminate (AgONC), a powerful, touch-sensitive explosive used in percussion caps, is made by reaction of silver metal with nitric acid in the presence of ethanol (C\n2H\n5OH). Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide (AgN\n3), formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide (NaN\n3), and silver acetylide, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas.</p>\n<p>Latent images formed in silver halide crystals are developed by treatment with alkaline solutions of reducing agents such as hydroquinone, metol (4-(methylamino)phenol sulfate) or ascorbate, which reduce the exposed halide to silver metal. Alkaline solutions of silver nitrate can be reduced to silver metal by reducing sugars such as glucose, and this reaction is used to silver glass mirrors and the interior of glass Christmas ornaments. Silver halides are soluble in solutions of sodium thiosulfate (Na\n2S\n2O\n3) which is used as a photographic fixer, to remove excess silver halide from photographic emulsions after image development.</p>\n<p>Silver metal is attacked by strong oxidizers such as potassium permanganate (KMnO\n4) and potassium dichromate (K\n2Cr\n2O\n7), and in the presence of potassium bromide (KBr); these compounds are used in photography to bleach silver images, converting them to silver halides that can either be fixed with thiosulfate or redeveloped to intensify the original image. Silver forms cyanide complexes (silver cyanide) that are soluble in water in the presence of an excess of cyanide ions. Silver cyanide solutions are used in electroplating of silver.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Many well-known uses of silver involve its precious metal properties, including currency, decorative items, and mirrors. The contrast between its bright white color and other media makes it very useful to the visual arts. It has also long been used to confer high monetary value as objects (such as silver coins and investment bars) or make objects symbolic of high social or political rank. Silver salts have been used since the Middle Ages to produce a yellow or orange colours to stained glass, and more complex decorative colour reactions can be produced by incorporating silver metal in blown, kilnformed or torchworked glass.</p>\n<h3>Currency</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Silver coin and Silver standard</div>\n<p>Silver, in the form of electrum (a gold–silver alloy), was coined to produce money around 700&nbsp;BC by the Lydians. Later, silver was refined and coined in its pure form. Many nations used silver as the basic unit of monetary value. In the modern world, silver bullion has the ISO currency code XAG. The name of the pound sterling (£) reflects the fact it originally represented the value of one pound Tower weight of sterling silver; other historical currencies, such as the French livre, have similar etymologies. During the 19th century, the bimetallism that prevailed in most countries was undermined by the discovery of large deposits of silver in the Americas; fearing a sharp decrease in the value of silver and thus the currency, most states switched to a gold standard by 1900. In some languages, such as Sanskrit, Spanish and Hebrew, the same word means both silver and money.</p>\n<p>The 20th century saw a gradual movement to fiat currency, with most of the world monetary system losing its link to precious metals after Richard Nixon took the United States dollar off the gold standard in 1971; the last currency backed by gold was the Swiss franc, which became a pure fiat currency on 1 May 2000. During this same period, silver gradually ceased to be used in circulating coins. In 1964, the United States stopped minting their silver dime and quarter. They minted their last circulating silver coin in 1970 in its 40% half-dollar.</p>\n<p>In 1968, Canada minted their last circulating silver coins which were the 50% dime and the 50% quarter. The Royal Canadian Mint still makes many collectible silver coins with various dollar denominations.</p>\n<p>Silver is used as a currency by many individuals, and is legal tender in the US state of Utah. Silver coins and bullion are also used as an investment to guard against inflation and devaluation.</p>\n<h3>Jewelry and silverware</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nShallow silver bowl, Persian, 6th century BC (Achaemenid). The deeper depressions reperesent lotus buds, an Egyptian motif. Walters Art Museum collections.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSilver plate with goddess Minerva from the Hildesheim Treasure, 1st century BC</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main articles: jewelry and silversmith</div>\n<p>Jewelry and silverware are traditionally made from sterling silver (standard silver), an alloy of 92.5% silver with 7.5% copper. In the US, only an alloy consisting of at least 90.0% fine silver can be marketed as \"silver\" (thus frequently stamped 900). Sterling silver (stamped 925) is harder than pure silver, and has a lower melting point (893°C) than either pure silver or pure copper. Britannia silver is an alternative, hallmark-quality standard containing 95.8% silver, often used to make silver tableware and wrought plate. With the addition of germanium, the patented modified alloy Argentium Sterling silver is formed, with improved properties, including resistance to firescale.</p>\n<p>Sterling silver jewelry is often plated with a thin coat of .999&nbsp;fine silver to give the item a shiny finish. This process is called \"flashing\". Silver jewelry can also be plated with rhodium (for a bright, shiny look) or gold (to produce silver gilt).</p>\n<p>Silver is a constituent of almost all colored carat gold alloys and carat gold solders, giving the alloys paler color and greater hardness. White 9&nbsp;carat gold contains 62.5% silver and 37.5% gold, while 22&nbsp;carat gold contains a minimum of 91.7% gold and 8.3% silver or copper or other metals.</p>\n<p>Historically, the training and guild organization of goldsmiths included silversmiths, as well, and the two crafts remain largely overlapping. Unlike blacksmiths, silversmiths do not shape the metal while it is red-hot, but instead, work it at room temperature with gentle and carefully placed hammer blows. The essence of silversmithing is to take a flat piece of metal and to transform it into a useful object using different hammers, stakes and other simple tools.</p>\n<p>While silversmiths specialize in, and principally work silver, they also work with other metals, such as gold, copper, steel, and brass. They make jewelry, silverware, armor, vases, and other artistic items. Because silver is such a malleable metal, silversmiths have a large range of choices with how they prefer to work the metal. Historically, silversmiths are mostly referred to as goldsmiths, which was usually the same guild. In the western Canadian silversmith tradition, guilds do not exist; however, mentoring through colleagues becomes a method of professional learning within a community of craftspeople.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, silversmiths mostly made \"silverware\" (cutlery, tableware, bowls, candlesticks and such). Only in more recent times has silversmithing become mainly work in jewelry, as much less solid silver tableware is now handmade.</p>\n<h3>Dentistry</h3>\n<p>Silver can be alloyed with mercury at room temperature to make amalgams that are widely used for dental fillings. To make dental amalgam, a mixture of powdered silver and other metals such as tin and gold is mixed with mercury to make a stiff paste that can be adapted to the shape of a cavity. The dental amalgam achieves initial hardness within minutes, and sets hard in a few hours.</p>\n<h3>Photography and electronics</h3>\n<p>Photography used 30.98% of the silver consumed in 1998 in the form of silver nitrate and silver halides. In 2001, 23.47% was used for photography, while 20.03% was used in jewelry, 38.51% for industrial uses, and only 3.5% for coins and medals. The use of silver in photography has rapidly declined, due to the lower demand for consumer color film from the advent of digital technology; since 2007, of the 907&nbsp;million ounces of silver in supply, just 117.6&nbsp;million ounces (13%) were consumed by the photographic sector, about 50% of the amount used in photography in 1998. By 2010, the supply had increased by about 10% to 1056.8&nbsp;million ounces, of which 72.7&nbsp;million ounces were used in the photographic sector, a decline of 38% compared with 2007.</p>\n<p>Some electrical and electronic products use silver for its superior conductivity, even when tarnished. The primary example of this is in high quality RF connectors. The increase in conductivity is also taken advantage of in RF engineering at VHF and higher frequencies, where conductors often cannot be scaled by 6%, due to tuning requirements, e.g. cavity filters. As an additional example, printed circuits and RFID antennas can be made using silver paints, and computer keyboards use silver electrical contacts. Silver cadmium oxide is used in high-voltage contacts because it can withstand arcing.</p>\n<p>Some manufacturers produce audio connector cables, speaker wires, and power cables using silver conductors, which have a 6% higher conductivity than ordinary copper ones of identical dimensions, but cost much more. Though debatable, many hi-fi enthusiasts believe silver wires improve sound quality.</p>\n<p>Small devices, such as hearing aids and watches, commonly use silver oxide batteries due to their long life and high energy-to-weight ratio. Another usage is high-capacity silver-zinc and silver-cadmium batteries.</p>\n<h3>Mirrors and optics</h3>\n<p>Mirrors which need superior reflectivity for visible light are commonly made with silver as the reflecting material in a process called silvering, though common mirrors are backed with aluminium. Using a process called sputtering, silver, along with other optically transparent layers, is applied to glass, creating low emissivity coatings used in high-performance insulated glazing. The amount of silver used per window is small because the silver layer is only 10–15 nanometers thick. However, the amount of silver-coated glass worldwide is hundreds of millions of square meters per year, leading to silver consumption on the order of 10 cubic meters or 100 metric tons/year. Silver color seen in architectural glass and tinted windows on vehicles is produced by sputtered chrome, stainless steel or other alloys. Silver is seldom used as the reflector in telescope mirrors, where aluminum is generally preferred because it is cheaper and less susceptible to tarnishing and corrosion. Silver is the reflective coating of choice for solar reflectors.</p>\n<h3>Other industrial and commercial applications</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThis Yanagisawa A9932J alto saxophone has a solid silver bell and neck with a solid phosphor bronze body. The bell, neck, and key-cups are extensively engraved. It was manufactured in 2008.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Silver and silver alloys are used in the construction of high-quality musical wind instruments of many types. Flutes, in particular, are commonly constructed of silver alloy or silver plated, both for appearance and for the frictional surface properties of silver.</p>\n<p>Silver's catalytic properties make it ideal for use as a catalyst in oxidation reactions, for example, the production of formaldehyde from methanol and air by means of silver screens or crystallites containing a minimum 99.95&nbsp;weight-percent silver. Silver (upon some suitable support) is probably the only catalyst available today to convert ethylene to ethylene oxide (later hydrolyzed to ethylene glycol, used for making polyesters)— an important industrial reaction. It is also used in the Oddy test to detect reduced sulfur compounds and carbonyl sulfides.</p>\n<p>Because silver readily absorbs free neutrons, it is commonly used to make control rods to regulate the fission chain reaction in pressurized water nuclear reactors, generally in the form of an alloy containing 80% silver, 15% indium, and 5% cadmium.</p>\n<p>Silver is used to make solder and brazing alloys, and as a thin layer on bearing surfaces can provide a significant increase in galling resistance and reduce wear under heavy load, particularly against steel.</p>\n<h3>Biology</h3>\n<p>Silver stains are used in biology to increase the contrast and visibility of cells and organelles in microscopy. Camillo Golgi used silver stains to study cells of the nervous system and the Golgi apparatus. Silver stains are used to stain proteins in gel electrophoresis and polyacrylamide gels, either as primary stains or to enhance the visibility and contrast of colloidal gold stain.</p>\n<h3>Medicine</h3>\n<div>Main article: Medical uses of silver</div>\n<p>The <b>medical uses of silver</b> include its incorporation into wound dressings, and its use as an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials may be used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as urinary catheters and endotracheal breathing tubes, where there is tentative evidence that it is effective in reducing catheter-related urinary tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia respectively. The silver ion (Ag+) is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria <i>in vitro</i>. Silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial in a variety of industrial, healthcare and domestic applications.</p>\n<h3>Investing</h3>\n<p>Silver coins and bullion are used for investing. Mints sell a wide variety of silver products for investors and collectors. Various institutions provide safe storage for large physical silver investments, and various types of silver investments can be made on the stock markets, including mining stocks. Silver bullion bars are sold in a wide range of ounces, provided by various mints and mines around the world. Silver coins and bullion bars are generally 99.9% pure, and labeled with \".999\".</p>\n<h3>Clothing</h3>\n<p>Silver inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi on clothing, such as socks, so is added to reduce odors and the risk of bacterial and fungal infections. It is incorporated into clothing or shoes either by integrating silver nanoparticles into the polymer from which yarns are made or by coating yarns with silver. The loss of silver during washing varies between textile technologies, and the resultant effect on the environment is not yet fully known.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe crescent moon has been used since ancient times to represent silver.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Silver has been used for thousands of years for ornaments and utensils, trade, and as the basis for many monetary systems. Its value as a precious metal was long considered second only to gold. The word \"silver\" appears in Anglo-Saxon in various spellings, such as <i>seolfor</i> and <i>siolfor</i>. A similar form is seen throughout the Germanic languages (compare Old High German <i>silabar</i> and <i>silbir</i>). The chemical symbol Ag is from the Latin word for \"silver\", <i>argentum</i> (compare Greek άργυρος, <i>árgyros</i>), from the Indo-European root <i>*arg-</i>, meaning \"white\" or \"shining\". Silver has been known since ancient times. Mentioned in the Book of Genesis, slag heaps found in Asia Minor and on the islands of the Aegean Sea indicate silver was being separated from lead as early as the 4th millennium BC using surface mining.</p>\n<p>The stability of the Roman currency relied to a high degree on the supply of silver bullion, which Roman miners produced on a scale unparalleled before the discovery of the New World. Reaching a peak production of 200 t per year, an estimated silver stock of 10,000 t circulated in the Roman economy in the middle of the second century AD, five to ten times larger than the combined amount of silver available to medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800 AD. Financial officials of the Roman Empire worried about the loss of silver to pay for highly demanded silk from Sinica (China).</p>\n<p>Mines were made in Laureion during 483 BC.</p>\n<p>In the Gospels, Jesus' disciple Judas Iscariot is infamous for having taken a bribe of 30 coins of silver from religious leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus of Nazareth over to soldiers of the High Priest Caiaphas.</p>\n<p>The Chinese Empire during most of its history primarily used silver as a means of exchange. In the 19th century, the threat to the balance of payments of the United Kingdom from Chinese merchants demanding payment in silver in exchange for tea, silk, and porcelain led to the Opium War because Britain had to find a way to address the imbalance in payments, and they decided to do so by selling opium produced in their colony of British India to China.</p>\n<p>Recorded use of silver to prevent infection dates to ancient Greece and Rome; it was rediscovered in the Middle Ages, when it was used for several purposes, such as to disinfect water and food during storage, and also for the treatment of burns and wounds as wound dressing. In the 19th century, sailors on long ocean voyages would put silver coins in barrels of water and wine to keep the liquid potable. Pioneers in America used the same idea as they made their journey from coast to coast. Silver solutions were approved in the 1920s by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as antibacterial agents.</p>\n<p>In certain circumstances, Islam permits Muslim men to wear silver jewelry. Muhammad himself wore a silver signet ring.</p>\n<p>In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead cupellation technology was developed by pre-Inca civilizations as early as CE 60–120.</p>\n<h3>Folklore</h3>\n\n<div>See also: Silver bullet</div>\n<p>In European folklore, silver was considered a mystical element, and much like Cold Iron, was considered something of an anathema towards aspects of the supernatural. The myth of silver's mystical properties goes deep into human history. Silver is believed to have purifying effects, a belief that likely arose from the observation that water kept in a silver pitcher took longer to go scummy; in real-life, silver has been shown to have antibacterial properties.</p>\n<p>As a noble metal akin to gold, this is often attributed to something along the lines of silver's \"Incorruptible Pure Pureness\". Due to the above, silver is almost always considered to be on the good end of magic (and items formed of it may also be \"Made of Good\"). In some traditions of Neopaganism, silver is the metal associated with the powers of the Moon, symbolizes the light of the moon, representing the feminine energies of the Triple Goddess. In Francis Barret's <i>The Magus</i>, it is said to make the bearer \"amiable, pleasent, cheerful and honoured, removing all malice and ill-will; it causes security in a journey, increases the riches, and health of body drives away enemies...\" In rituals, silver is said to encourage a harmonious energy and a sense of peace.</p>\n<p>In folklore, and now later in fiction, the metal is said to do many things, from channel magic, to stopping evil (including warding off or harming vampires and werewolves), making magic mirrors, to turning water into a \"Healing Potion\". Throughout mythology and subsequent fiction, silver has been a common ward against evil. Silver, especially if blessed, was thought to ward off or harm certain supernatural beings (including vampires) since the Middle Ages.</p>\n<h3>World War II</h3>\n<p>During World War II, the short supply of copper led to the substitution of silver in many industrial applications. The United States government loaned out silver from its massive reserve located in the West Point vaults to a wide range of industrial users. One very important use was for bus bars for new aluminum plants needed to make aircraft. During the war, many electrical connectors and switches were silver plated. Another use was aircraft master rod bearings and other types of bearings. Since silver can replace tin in solder at a lower volume, a large amount of tin was freed up for other uses by substituting government silver. Silver was also used as the reflector in searchlights and other types of lights. One high-tech use of silver was for conductors at Oak Ridge National Laboratory used in calutrons to isolate uranium as part of the Manhattan project. (After the war ended, the silver was returned to the vaults.) Silver was used in nickels during the war to save that metal for use in steel alloys.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and extraction</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTime trend of silver production</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNative silver</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Silver mining</div>\n<p>Silver is found in native form, as an alloy with gold (electrum), and in ores containing sulfur, arsenic, antimony or chlorine. Ores include argentite (AgS), chlorargyrite (AgCl) which includes horn silver, and pyrargyrite (AgSbS). The principal sources of silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia. Peru, Bolivia and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, and are still major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Cristobal (Bolivia), Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico). Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama (Chile), Navidad (Argentina), Jaunicipio (Mexico), Malku Khota (Bolivia), and Hackett River (Canada).</p>\n<p>The metal is primarily produced as a byproduct of electrolytic copper refining, gold, nickel, and zinc refining, and by application of the Parkes process on lead metal obtained from lead ores that contain small amounts of silver. Commercial-grade fine silver is at least 99.9% pure, and purities greater than 99.999% are available. In 2011, Mexico was the top producer of silver (4,500 tonnes or 19% of the world's total), closely followed by Peru (4,000 t) and China (4,000 t).</p>\n<h2>Price</h2>\n<div>Main articles: Silver as an investment and Silver standard</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSilver price history in 1960–2011</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>At a May 9, 2013 price of about $24.00 USD per troy ounce, silver is about 1/61 the price of gold. The ratio has varied from 1/15 to 1/100 in the past 100 years. Physical silver bullion prices are higher than the paper prices, with premiums increasing when demand is high and local shortages occur.</p>\n<p>In 1980, the silver price rose to a peak for modern times of US$49.45&nbsp;per&nbsp;troy ounce (ozt) due to market manipulation of Nelson Bunker Hunt and Herbert Hunt. Inflation-adjusted to 2012, this is approximately US$138 per troy ounce. Some time after Silver Thursday, the price was back to $10/ozt. From 2001 to 2010, the price moved from $4.37 to $20.19 (average London US$/oz). According to the Silver Institute, silver's recent gains have greatly stemmed from a rise in investor interest and an increase in fabrication demand. In late April 2011, silver reached an all-time high of $49.76/ozt.</p>\n<p>In earlier times, silver has commanded much higher prices. In the early 15th century, the price of silver is estimated to have surpassed $1,200 per ounce, based on 2011 dollars. The discovery of massive silver deposits in the New World during the succeeding centuries has been stated as a cause for its price to have diminished greatly.</p>\n<p>The price of silver is important in Judaic law. The lowest fiscal amount a Jewish court, or Beth Din, can convene to adjudicate a case over is a <i>shova pruta</i> (value of a Babylonian <i>pruta</i> coin). This is fixed at .025 grams (0.00088&nbsp;oz) of pure, unrefined silver, at market price. In a Jewish tradition, still continuing today, on the first birthday of a first-born son, the parents pay the price of five pure-silver coins to a <i>Kohen</i> (priest). Today, the Israel mint fixes the coins at 117 grams (4.1&nbsp;oz) of silver. The <i>Kohen</i> will often give those silver coins back as a gift for the child to inherit.</p>\n<h2>Human exposure and consumption</h2>\n<p>Silver plays no known natural biological role in humans, and possible health effects of silver are a disputed subject. Silver itself is not toxic, but most silver salts are. In large doses, silver and compounds containing it can be absorbed into the circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues, leading to argyria, which results in a blue-grayish pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Argyria is rare, and although this condition does not otherwise harm a person's health, it is disfiguring and usually permanent. Mild forms of Argyria are sometimes mistaken for cyanosis.</p>\n<h3>Monitoring exposure</h3>\n<p>Overexposure to silver can occur in workers in the metallurgical industry, persons taking silver-containing dietary supplements, patients who have received silver sulfadiazine treatment, and individuals who accidentally or intentionally ingest silver salts. Silver concentrations in whole blood, plasma, serum, or urine may be measured to monitor for safety in exposed workers, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims, or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage.</p>\n<h3>Use in food</h3>\n<p>Silver is used in food coloring; it has the E174 designation and is approved in the European Union.</p>\n<p>The safety of silver for use in food is disputed. Traditional Indian dishes sometimes include the use of decorative silver foil known as <i>vark</i>, and in various cultures, silver <i>dragée</i> are used to decorate cakes, cookies, and other dessert items. The use of silver as a food additive is not approved in the United States and Australia.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>List of silver compounds</li>\n<li>Silverpoint drawing</li>\n<li>Free silver</li>\n<li>List of elements</li>\n<li>Hardnesses of the elements (data page)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds in Lide, D.

  "title": "Cadmium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Cadmium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Cd</b> and atomic number 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury. Like zinc, it prefers oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds and like mercury it shows a low melting point compared to transition metals. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in the Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate.</p>\n<p>Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and therefore is a byproduct of zinc production. It was used for a long time as a pigment and for corrosion resistant plating on steel while cadmium compounds were used to stabilize plastic. With the exception of its use in nickel–cadmium batteries and cadmium telluride solar panels, the use of cadmium is generally decreasing. These declines have been due to competing technologies, cadmium’s toxicity in certain forms and concentration and resulting regulations. Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in marine diatoms.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Cadmium is a soft, malleable, ductile, bluish-white divalent metal. It is similar in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds. Unlike other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion and as a result it is used as a protective layer when deposited on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<div>See also category: Cadmium compounds</div>\n<p>Although cadmium usually has an oxidation state of +2, it also exists in the +1 state. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl), cadmium sulfate (CdSO), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO)). The oxidation state +1 can be reached by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd cation, which is similar to the Hg cation in mercury(I) chloride.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Cd + CdCl + 2 AlCl → Cd(AlCl)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The structures of many cadmium complexes with nucleobases, amino acids and vitamins have been determined.</p>\n<h4>Cadmium-selective sensors</h4>\n<p>Cadmium-selective sensors, based on the fluorophore BODIPY have been developed for imaging and sensing of cadmium in cells</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe cadmium-113 total cross section clearly showing the cadmium cut-off</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of cadmium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring cadmium is composed of 8 isotopes. Two of them are naturally radioactive, and three are expected to decay but have not been experimentally confirmed to do so. The two natural radioactive isotopes are Cd (beta decay, half-life is 7.7 × 10 years) and Cd (two-neutrino double beta decay, half-life is 2.9 × 10 years). The other three are Cd, Cd (both double electron capture), and Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on their half-life times have been set. At least three isotopes&nbsp;– Cd, Cd, and Cd&nbsp;– are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 2.5 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known meta states, with the most stable being Cd (t = 14.1 years), Cd (t = 44.6 days), and Cd (t = 3.36 hours).</p>\n<p>The known isotopes of cadmium range in atomic mass from 94.950 u (Cd) to 131.946 u (Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112 u, the primary decay mode is electron capture and the dominant decay product is element 47 (silver). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through beta emission producing element 49 (indium).</p>\n<p>One isotope of cadmium, Cd, absorbs neutrons with very high probability if they have an energy below the <i>cadmium cut-off</i> and transmits them otherwise. The cadmium cut-off is about 0.5 eV. Neutrons with energy below the cut-off are deemed slow neutrons, distinguishing them from intermediate and fast neutrons.</p>\n<p>Cadmium is created via the long s-process in low-medium mass stars with masses of 0.6 to 10 solar masses, which lasts thousands of years. It requires a silver atom to capture a neutron and then undergo beta decay.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFriedrich Stromeyer</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Cadmium (Latin <i>cadmia</i>, Greek <i>καδμεία</i> meaning \"calamine\", a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals, which was named after the Greek mythological character, Κάδμος Cadmus, the founder of Thebes) was discovered simultaneously in 1817 by Friedrich Stromeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate. Stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in zinc carbonate (calamine), and, for 100 years, Germany remained the only important producer of the metal. The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, since the metal was found in this zinc compound. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reduction of the sulfide. The possibility to use cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the 1840s but the lack of cadmium limited this application.</p>\n<p>Even though cadmium and its compounds may be toxic in certain forms and concentrations, the British Pharmaceutical Codex from 1907 states that cadmium iodide was used as a medication to treat \"enlarged joints, scrofulous glands, and chilblains\".</p>\n<p>In 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures redefined the meter in terms of a red cadmium spectral line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). This definition has since been changed (see krypton).</p>\n<p>After the industrial scale production of cadmium started in the 1930s and 1940s, the major application of cadmium was the coating of iron and steel to prevent corrosion; in 1944, 62% and in 1956, 59% of the cadmium in the United States was for coating. In 1956, 24% of the cadmium used within the United States was used for the second application, which was for red, orange and yellow pigments based on sulfides and selenides of cadmium. The stabilizing effect of cadmium-containing chemicals like the carboxylates cadmium laureate and cadmium stearate on PVC led to an increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s. The use of cadmium in applications such as pigments, coatings, stabilizers and alloys declined due to environmental and health regulations in the 1980s and 1990s; in 2006, only 7% of total cadmium consumption was used for plating and coating and only 10% was used for pigments. The decrease in consumption in other applications was made up by a growing demand of cadmium in nickel-cadmium batteries, which accounted for 81% of the cadmium consumption in the United States in 2006.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCadmium metal</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Category:Cadmium minerals</div>\n<p>Cadmium makes up about 0.1&nbsp;ppm of the Earth's crust. Compared with the more abundant 65&nbsp;ppm zinc, cadmium is rare. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by the geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium which makes geological separation unlikely. As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling iron and steel scrap. Production in the United States began in 1907, but it was not until after World War I that cadmium came into wide use. One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia.</p>\n<p>Rocks mined to produce phosphate fertilizers contain varying amounts of cadmium, leading to a cadmium concentration of up to 300&nbsp;mg/kg in the produced phosphate fertilizers and thus in the high cadmium content in agricultural soils. Coal can contain significant amounts of cadmium, which ends up mostly in the flue dust.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>The British Geological Survey reports that in 2001, China was the top producer of cadmium, producing almost one-sixth of the world share, closely followed by South Korea and Japan.</p>\n<p>Cadmium is a common impurity in zinc ores, and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium. In 1970s, the output of cadmium was 6.5 pounds per ton of zinc. Zinc sulfide ores are roasted in the presence of oxygen, converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated out of the electrolysis solution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>World production trend</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Cadmium output in 2005</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Cadmium has many common industrial uses as it is a key component in battery production, is present in cadmium pigments, coatings, and is commonly used in electroplating.</p>\n<h3>Batteries</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNi-Cd batteries</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 2009, 86% of cadmium was used in batteries, predominantly in rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2&nbsp;V. The cell consists of a positive nickel hydroxide electrode and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an alkaline electrolyte (potassium hydroxide). The European Union banned the use of cadmium in electronics in 2004 with several exceptions but reduced the allowed content of cadmium in electronics to 0.002%.</p>\n<h3>Electroplating</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA photograph and representative spectrum of photoluminescence from colloidal CdSe quantum dots</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Cadmium electroplating, consuming 6% of the global production, can be found in the aircraft industry due to the ability to resist corrosion when applied to steel components. This coating is passivated by the usage of chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels caused by the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition). In addition, titanium embrittlement caused by cadmium-plated tool residues resulted in banishment of these tools (along with routine tool testing programs to detect any cadmium contamination) from the A-12/SR-71 and U-2 programs, and subsequent aircraft programs using titanium.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear fission</h3>\n<p>Cadmium is used as a barrier to control neutrons in nuclear fission. The pressurized water reactor designed by Westinghouse Electric Company uses an alloy consisting of 80% silver, 15% indium, and 5% cadmium.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTrain painted with cadmium orange</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Cadmium oxide is used in black and white television phosphors and in the blue and green phosphors for color television picture tubes. Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is used as a photoconductive surface coating for photocopier drums.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCadmium sulfide</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In paint pigments, cadmium forms various salts, with CdS being the most common. This sulfide is used as a yellow pigment. Cadmium selenide can be used as red pigment, commonly called <i>cadmium red</i>. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium yellows, oranges, and reds are the most brilliant and long-lasting colors to use. In fact, during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders, or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Since these pigments are potentially toxic, it is recommended to use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin when working with them even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is usually reported to be less than 1%.</p>\n<p>In PVC, cadmium was used as heat, light, and weathering stabilizers. Currently, cadmium stabilizers have been completely replaced with barium-zinc, calcium-zinc and organo-tin stabilizers. Cadmium is used in many kinds of solder and bearing alloys, due to a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance. It is also found in some of the lowest-melting alloys, such as Wood's metal.</p>\n<h3>Laboratory uses</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nViolet light from a helium cadmium metal vapor laser. The highly monochromatic color arises from the 441.563 nm transition line of cadmium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Helium–cadmium lasers are a common source of blue-ultraviolet laser light. They operate at either 325 or 422&nbsp;nm and are used in fluorescence microscopes and various laboratory experiments. Cadmium selenide quantum dots emit bright luminescence under UV excitation (He-Cd laser, for example). The color of this luminescence can be green, yellow or red depending on the particle size. Colloidal solutions of those particles are used for imaging of biological tissues and solutions with a fluorescence microscope.</p>\n<p>Cadmium is a component of some compound semiconductors, such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and cadmium telluride, which can be used for light detection or solar cells. HgCdTe is sensitive to infrared light and therefore may be utilized as an infrared detector or switch for example in remote control devices.</p>\n<p>In molecular biology, cadmium is used to block voltage-dependent calcium channels from fluxing calcium ions, as well as in hypoxia research to stimulate proteasome-dependent degradation of Hif-1α.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Cadmium has no known useful role in higher organisms, but a cadmium-dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in some marine diatoms. The diatoms live in environments with very low zinc concentrations and cadmium performs the function normally carried out by zinc in other anhydrases. The discovery was made using X-ray absorption fluorescence spectroscopy (XAFS).</p>\n<p>The highest concentration of cadmium has been found to be absorbed in the kidneys of humans, and up to about 30&nbsp;mg of cadmium is commonly inhaled throughout childhood and adolescence. Cadmium can be used to block calcium channels in chicken neurons. Analytical methods for the determination of cadmium in biological samples have been reviewed.</p>\n<h2>Environment</h2>\n<p>The biogeochemistry of cadmium and its release to the environment has been the subject of review, as has the speciation of cadmium in the environment</p>\n<h2>Safety</h2>\n<div>Main article: Cadmium poisoning</div>\n<p>The bioinorganic aspects of cadmium toxicity have been reviewed. </p>\n<p>The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds. Inhalation of cadmium-containing fumes can result initially in metal fume fever but may progress to chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and death.</p>\n<p>Cadmium is also an environmental hazard. Human exposures to environmental cadmium are primarily the result of fossil fuel combustion, phosphate fertilizers, natural sources, iron and steel production, cement production and related activities, nonferrous metals production, and municipal solid waste incineration. Bread, root crops, and vegetables also contribute to the cadmium in modern populations. There have been a few instances of general population toxicity as the result of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research is ongoing regarding the estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer. In the decades leading up to World War II, Japanese mining operations contaminated the Jinzū River with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops growing along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consuming the contaminated rice developed itai-itai disease and renal abnormalities, including proteinuria and glucosuria.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nJinzū River area, which was contaminated with cadmium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The victims of this poisoning were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, while cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors. Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, which bans certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.</p>\n<p>Although some studies linked exposure to cadmium with lung and prostate cancer, there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium. More recent studies suggest that arsenic rather than cadmium may lead to the increased lung cancer mortality rates. Furthermore, most data regarding the carcinogenicity of cadmium rely on research confounded by the presence of other carcinogenic substances.</p>\n<p>Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population. It has been estimated that about 10% of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking. The absorption of cadmium from the lungs is much more effective than that from the gut, and as much as 50% of the cadmium inhaled via cigarette smoke may be absorbed.</p>\n<p>On average, smokers have 4–5 times higher blood cadmium concentrations and 2–3 times higher kidney cadmium concentrations than non-smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from passive smoking. No significant effect on blood cadmium concentrations has been detected in children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.</p>\n<p>Cadmium exposure is a risk factor associated with early atherosclerosis and hypertension, which can both lead to cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<h3>Regulations</h3>\n<p>Due to the adverse effects on the environment and human health, the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the REACH Regulation.</p>\n<h3>Product recalls</h3>\n<p>In May 2006, a sale of the seats from Arsenal F.C.'s old stadium, Highbury in London, England was cancelled after the seats were discovered to contain trace amounts of cadmium. Reports of high levels of cadmium use in children's jewelry in 2010 led to a US Consumer Product Safety Commission investigation. The U.S. CPSC issued specific recall notices for cadmium content applying to jewelry sold by Claire's and Wal-Mart stores. In June 2010 McDonald's voluntarily recalled more than 12 million promotional \"Shrek Forever After 3D\" Collectable Drinking Glasses owing to concerns over cadmium levels in paint pigments used on the glassware. The glasses were manufactured by Arc International, of Millville, NJ, USA.</p>\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\n<p>Hartwig, Andrea (2013). \"Chapter 15. Cadmium and cancer\".

  "title": "Indium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with Iridium.</div>\n\n<p><b>Indium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>In</b> and atomic number&nbsp;49. This rare, very soft, malleable and easily fusible post-transition metal is chemically similar to gallium and thallium, and shows intermediate properties between these two. Indium was discovered in 1863 and named for the indigo blue line in its spectrum that was the first indication of its existence in zinc ores, as a new and unknown element. The metal was first isolated in the following year. Zinc ores continue to be the primary source of indium, where it is found in compound form. Very rarely the element can be found as grains of native (free) metal, but these are not of commercial importance.</p>\n<p>Indium's current primary application is to form transparent electrodes from indium tin oxide (ITO) in liquid crystal displays and touchscreens, and this use largely determines its global mining production. It is widely used in thin-films to form lubricated layers (during World War II it was widely used to coat bearings in high-performance aircraft). It is also used for making particularly low melting point alloys, and is a component in some lead-free solders.</p>\n<p>Indium is not known to be used by any organism. In a similar way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection, but oral indium compounds do not have the chronic toxicity of salts of heavy metals, probably due to poor absorption in basic conditions. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nIndium wetting the glass surface of a test tube</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Indium is a very soft, silvery-white, relatively rare poor metal with a bright luster. Like tin, when it is bent indium emits a high-pitched \"cry\". Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60&nbsp;°C (313.88&nbsp;°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. Its boiling point is, however, moderate, being 2072&nbsp;°C (3762&nbsp;°F), which is higher than that of thallium, but lower than that of gallium, showing opposition to melting points trend. The density of indium, 7.31&nbsp;g·cm, is also higher than that of gallium, but lower than that of thallium.</p>\n<p>An indium atom has 49 electrons, having an electronic configuration of [Kr]4d5s5p. In its compounds, indium most commonly loses its three outermost electrons, becoming indium(III) ions, In, but in some cases the pair of 5s-electrons can stay within the atom, indium thus oxidized only to indium(I), In. This happens due to inert pair effect, which occurs because of stabilization of 5s-orbital due to relativistic effects, which are stronger closer to the bottom of the periodic table. Thallium shows an even stronger effect, making oxidation to thallium(I) more likely than to thallium(III), making +1 the more likely oxidation state.</p>\n<p>A number of standard electrode potentials, depending on the reaction under study, are reported for indium:</p>\n\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<p>Indium is a post-transition metal and chemically, is the intermediate element between its group 13 neighbors gallium and thallium. It shows two main oxidation states, which are +1 and +3, with latter being more stable, whereas the only common oxidation state of gallium is +3 and thallium shows +1 more likely than +3, with thallium(III) being a moderately strong oxidizing agent, while indium(III) is stable and indium(I) is a powerful reducing agent.</p>\n<p>Indium does not react with water, but it is oxidized by stronger oxidizing agents, such as halogens or oxalic acid, to give indium(III) compounds. It does not react with boron, silicon or carbon, and the corresponding boride, silicide or carbide are not known. Similarly, reaction between indium and hydrogen has not been observed, but both indium(I) and indium(III) hydrides are known.</p>\n<p>Indium(III) oxide is formed at high temperatures during reaction between indium and oxygen, with blue flame. It is amphoteric, i.&nbsp;e. it can react with both acids and bases. Its reaction with water results in insoluble indium(III) hydroxide, which is also amphoteric, reacting with alkalies to give indates(III) and with acids to give indium(III) salts:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>In(OH) + 2&nbsp;NaOH → 2&nbsp;Na[InO] + HO</dd>\n<dd>In(OH) + 3&nbsp;HCl → InCl + 3&nbsp;HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The hydrolysis of sodium indate(III) gives weak indic acid, HInO. Out of common indium(III) salts, chloride, sulfate and nitrate are soluble. In water solutions, In and [InO] ions are hydrolyzed to give InOH and HInO due to generally amphoteric character of indium(III) ions. Indium(III) compounds are not well-soluble, similarly to thallium(III) compounds; however, indium(III) salts of strong acids, such as chloride, sulfate and nitrate are soluble, hydrolyzing in water solutions. The In ion is colorless in solution because of the absence of unpaired electrons in the d- and f-electron shells.</p>\n<p>Indium(I) compounds are not as common as indium(III) ones; only chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfide and cyclopentadienyl are well-characterized. Indium(I) sulfide is the product of reaction between indium and sulfur or indium and hydrogen sulfide, and can be received at 700—1000&nbsp;°C. Indium(I) oxide black powder is received at 850&nbsp;°C during reaction between indium and carbon dioxide or during decomposition of indium(III) oxide at 1200&nbsp;°C. Cyclopentadienylindium(I), which was the first organoindium(I) compound reported, is polymer consisting of zigzag chains of alternating indium atoms and cyclopentadienyl complexes.</p>\n<p>Less frequently, indium shows intermediate oxidation state +2, which lies between the common ones, most notably in halides, InX and [InX]. Several other compounds are known to combine indium(I) and indium(III), such as In(InCl)Cl, In(InBr)(InBr), InInBr.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of indium</div>\n<p>Indium occurs naturally on Earth only in two primordial nuclides, indium-113 and indium-115. Out of this two, indium-115 makes up 95.7% of all indium but it is radioactive, decaying to tin-115 via beta decay with half-life of 4.41×10 years, four orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe and nearly 50,000 times longer than that of natural thorium. This situation is uncommon among stable chemical elements; only indium, tellurium, and rhenium have been shown to have most-abundant isotopes that are radioactive. The less common natural isotope of indium, indium-113, is stable.</p>\n<p>Indium has 39 known isotopes, ranging in mass between 97 and 135. Only one of them is stable and one has half-life exceeding 10 years; the most stable other indium isotope is indium-111, which has half-life of approximately 2.8 days. All other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 5 hours. Indium also has 47 meta states, out of which indium-114m1 is the most stable, being more stable than ground state of any indium isotope, except for the primordial ones.</p>\n<h3>Creation and occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also category: Indium compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe s-process acting in the range from silver to antimony.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Indium is created via the long-lasting, (up to thousands of years), s-process in low-medium mass stars (which range in mass between 0.6 and 10 masses of Sun). When a silver-109 atom, which comprises approximately half of all silver in existence, catches a neutron, it undergoes a beta decay to become cadmium-110. Capturing further neutrons, it becomes cadmium-115, which decays to indium-115 via another beta decay. This explains why the radioactive isotope predominates in abundance compared to the stable one.</p>\n<p>Indium is 61st most abundant element in the Earth's crust at approximately 49&nbsp;ppb, making indium approximately as abundant as mercury. Fewer than 10 indium minerals are known, such as dzhalindite (In(OH)) and indite (FeInS), but none of these occurs in significant deposits.</p>\n<p>Based on content of indium in zinc ore stocks, there is a worldwide reserve base of approximately 6,000 tonnes of economically viable indium. However, the Indium Corporation, the largest processor of indium, claims that, on the basis of increasing recovery yields during extraction, recovery from a wider range of base metals (including tin, copper and other polymetallic deposits) and new mining investments, the long-term supply of indium is sustainable, reliable and sufficient to meet increasing future demands.</p>\n<p>This conclusion may be reasonable considering that silver, which is one-third as abundant as indium in the Earth's crust, is currently mined at approximately 18,300 tonnes per year, which is 40 times greater than current indium mining rates.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores from the mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They dissolved the minerals pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. As it was known that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium they searched for the green emission lines with spectroscopy. The green lines were absent but a blue line was present in the spectrum. As no element was known with a bright blue emission they concluded that a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element with the blue spectral line indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum. Richter went on to isolate the metal in 1864. At the World Fair 1867 an ingot of 0.5&nbsp;kg (1.1&nbsp;lb) was presented.</p>\n<p>In 1924, indium was found to have a valuable ability to stabilize non-ferrous metals, which was the first significant use for the element. It took until 1936 for the U.S. Bureau of Mines to list indium as a commodity, and even in early the 1950s only very limited applications for indium were known, the most important of which was making light-emitting diodes and coating bearings for aircraft engines during World War II. The start of production of indium-containing semiconductors started in 1952. The development and widespread use of indium-containing nuclear control rods increased demand during the 1970s, and the use of indium tin oxide in liquid crystal displays increased and became the major application by 1992.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>The lack of indium mineral deposits and the fact that indium is enriched in sulfidic lead, tin, copper, iron and predominately in zinc deposits, makes zinc production the main source for indium. The indium is leached from slag and dust of zinc production. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with the exact composition of the slag and dust.</p>\n<p>Indium is produced mainly from residues generated during zinc ore processing but is also found in iron, lead, and copper ores. China is a leading producer of indium (390 tonnes in 2012), followed by Canada, Japan and South Korea with 70 tonnes each. The Teck Cominco refinery in Trail, British Columbia, is a large single-source indium producer, with an output of 32.5&nbsp;tonnes in 2005, 41.8&nbsp;tonnes in 2004 and 36.1&nbsp;tonnes in 2003. South American Silver Corporation's Malku Khota property in Bolivia is a large resource of indium with an indicated resource of 1,481 tonnes and inferred resource of 935 tonnes. Adex Mining Inc.’s Mount Pleasant Mine in New Brunswick, Canada, holds some of the world’s total known indium resources.</p>\n<p>The amount of indium consumed is largely a function of worldwide LCD production. Worldwide production is currently 475 tonnes per year from mining and a further 650 tonnes per year from recycling. Demand has risen rapidly in recent years with the popularity of LCD computer monitors and television sets, which now account for 50% of indium consumption. Increased manufacturing efficiency and recycling (especially in Japan) maintain a balance between demand and supply. According to the UNEP, indium's end-of-life recycling rate is less than 1%. Demand increased as the metal is used in LCDs and televisions, and supply decreased when a number of Chinese mining concerns stopped extracting indium from their zinc tailings. In 2002, the price was US$94 per kilogram. The recent changes in demand and supply have resulted in high and fluctuating prices of indium, which from 2006 to 2009 ranged from US$382/kg to US$918/kg.</p>\n<p>It has been estimated that there is less than 20 years left of indium supplies, based on current rates of extraction, demonstrating the need for additional recycling.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA magnified image of an LCD screen showing RGB pixels. Individual transistors are seen as white dots in the bottom part.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The first large-scale application for indium was as a coating for bearings in high-performance aircraft engines during World War II. Afterward, production gradually increased as new uses were found in fusible alloys, solders, and electronics. In the 1950s, tiny beads of it were used for the emitters and collectors of PNP alloy junction transistors. In the middle and late 1980s, the development of indium phosphide semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid crystal displays (LCD) aroused much interest. By 1992, the thin-film application had become the largest end use.</p>\n<h3>Electronics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Indium oxide (InO) and indium tin oxide (ITO) are used as a transparent conductive coating applied to glass substrates in the making of electroluminescent panels.</li>\n<li>Some indium compounds such as indium antimonide, indium phosphide, and indium nitride are semiconductors with useful properties.</li>\n<li>Indium is used in the synthesis of the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), which is used for the manufacture of thin film solar cells.</li>\n<li>Used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes based on compound semiconductors such as InGaN, InGaP that are fabricated by Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) technology.</li>\n<li>Ultrapure metalorganics of indium include high purity trimethylindium (TMI), which is used as a precursor in III-V compound semiconductors, while it is also used as the semiconductor dopant in II-VI compound semiconductors.</li>\n<li>One of many substitutes for mercury in alkaline batteries to prevent the zinc from corroding and releasing hydrogen gas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Metal and alloys</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDuctile indium wire</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Very small amounts used in aluminium alloy sacrificial anodes (for salt water applications) to prevent passivation of the aluminium.</li>\n<li>To bond gold electrical test leads to superconductors, indium is used as a conducting adhesive and applied under a microscope with precision tweezers.</li>\n<li>In the form of a wire it is used as a vacuum seal and a thermal conductor in cryogenics and ultra-high vacuum applications. For example, in manufacturing gaskets which deform to fill gaps.</li>\n<li>Used as a calibration material for Differential scanning calorimetry.</li>\n<li>It is an ingredient in the gallium-indium-tin alloy Galinstan, which is liquid at room temperature while not being toxic like mercury.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Indium tin oxide is used as a light filter in low-pressure sodium vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the tube and therefore improves the performance of the lamp.</li>\n<li>Indium's melting point of 429.7485 K (156.5985 °C) is a defining fixed point on the international temperature scale ITS-90.</li>\n<li>Indium's high neutron capture cross section for thermal neutrons makes it suitable for use in control rods for nuclear reactors, typically in an alloy containing 80% silver, 15% indium, and 5% cadmium.</li>\n<li>In nuclear engineering, the (n,n') reactions of In and In are used to determine magnitudes of neutron fluxes.</li>\n<li>Indium is also used as a thermal interface material by personal computer enthusiasts in the form of pre-shaped foil sheets fitted between the heat-transfer surface of a microprocessor and its heat sink. The application of heat partially melts the foil and allows the indium metal to fill in any microscopic gaps and pits between the two surfaces, removing any insulating air pockets that would otherwise compromise heat transfer efficiency.</li>\n<li>In emits gamma radiation and is used in indium leukocyte imaging, or indium scintigraphy, a technique of medical imaging that is particularly helpful in differentiating conditions such as osteomyelitis from decubitus ulcers for assessment of route and duration of antibiotic therapy. Indium leukocyte scintigraphy has many applications, including early phase drug development, and the monitoring of activity of white blood cells. For the test, blood is taken from the patient, white cells removed, labeled with the radioactive In, then re-injected back into the patient. Gamma imaging will then reveal any areas of on-going white cell localization such as new and developing areas of infection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Precautions and health issues</h2>\n<p>Pure indium in metal form is considered nontoxic by most sources. In the welding and semiconductor industries, where indium exposure is relatively high, there have been no reports of any toxic side-effects. Indium compounds, like aluminum compounds, complex with hydroxyls to form insoluble salts in basic conditions, and are thus not well-absorbed from food, giving them fairly low oral toxicty. Soluble indium(III) is toxic when delivered parenterally, however, causing damage primarily to the kidney (both inner and outer parts), but additionally to heart and liver, and may be teratogenic. Other indium compounds are toxic when administered outside the gastrointestinal tract: for example, anhydrous indium trichloride (InCl) and indium phosphide (InP) are quite toxic when delivered into the lungs (the latter is a suspected carcinogen). Occupational exposure to indium compounds was associated with PAP, cholesterol ester crystals and granulomas, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and pneumothoraces. The available evidence suggests exposure to indium compounds causes a novel lung disease that may begin with PAP and progress to include fibrosis and emphysema, and, in some cases, premature death </p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^    Alfantazi, A.

  "title": "Tin",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Tin (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Tin</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Sn</b> (for Latin: stannum) and atomic number&nbsp;50. It is a main group metal in group 14 of the periodic table. Tin shows chemical similarity to both neighboring group-14 elements, germanium and lead and has two possible oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table. Tin is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, where it occurs as tin dioxide, SnO.</p>\n<p>This silvery, malleable post-transition metal is not easily oxidized in air and is used to coat other metals to prevent corrosion. The first alloy, used in large scale since 3000 BC, was bronze, an alloy of tin and copper. After 600 BC pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85–90% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper, antimony and lead, was used for flatware from the Bronze Age until the 20th century. In modern times tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin/lead soft solders, typically containing 60% or more of tin. Another large application for tin is corrosion-resistant tin plating of steel. Because of its low toxicity, tin-plated metal is also used for food packaging, giving the name to tin cans, which are made mostly of steel.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDroplet of solidified molten tin</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tin is a malleable, ductile and highly crystalline silvery-white metal. When a bar of tin is bent, a crackling sound known as the tin cry can be heard due to the twinning of the crystals. Tin melts at a low temperature of about 232&nbsp;°C (449.6&nbsp;°F), which is further reduced to 177.3&nbsp;°C (351&nbsp;°F) for 11-nm particles.</p>\n<p>β-tin (the metallic form, or white tin), which is stable at and above room temperature, is malleable. In contrast, α-tin (nonmetallic form, or gray tin), which is stable below 13.2&nbsp;°C (56&nbsp;°F), is brittle. α-tin has a diamond cubic crystal structure, similar to diamond, silicon or germanium. α-tin has no metallic properties at all because its atoms form a covalent structure where electrons cannot move freely. It is a dull-gray powdery material with no common uses, other than a few specialized semiconductor applications. These two allotropes, α-tin and β-tin, are more commonly known as <i>gray tin</i> and <i>white tin</i>, respectively. Two more allotropes, γ and σ, exist at temperatures above 161&nbsp;°C (322&nbsp;°F) and pressures above several GPa. In cold conditions, β-tin tends to transform spontaneously into α-tin, a phenomenon known as \"tin pest\". Although the α-β transformation temperature is nominally 13.2&nbsp;°C, impurities (e.g. Al, Zn, etc.) lower the transition temperature well below 0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F), and upon addition of Sb or Bi the transformation may not occur at all, increasing the durability of the tin.</p>\n<p>Commercial grades of tin (99.8%) resist transformation because of the inhibiting effect of the small amounts of bismuth, antimony, lead and silver present as impurities. Alloying elements such as copper, antimony, bismuth, cadmium and silver increase its hardness. Tin tends rather easily to form hard, brittle intermetallic phases, which are often undesirable. It does not form wide solid solution ranges in other metals in general, and there are few elements that have appreciable solid solubility in tin. Simple eutectic systems, however, occur with bismuth, gallium, lead, thallium and zinc.</p>\n<p>Tin becomes a superconductor below 3.72&nbsp;K. In fact, tin was one of the first superconductors to be studied; the Meissner effect, one of the characteristic features of superconductors, was first discovered in superconducting tin crystals.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Tin resists corrosion from water but can be attacked by acids and alkalis. Tin can be highly polished and is used as a protective coat for other metals. In this case the formation of a protective oxide layer is used to prevent further oxidation. This oxide layer forms on pewter and other tin alloys. Tin acts as a catalyst when oxygen is in solution and helps accelerate chemical attack.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of tin</div>\n<p>Tin is the element with the greatest number of stable isotopes, ten, being those with atomic masses of 112, 114 to 120, 122 and 124. Of these, the most abundant ones are Sn (at almost a third of all tin), Sn, and Sn, while the least abundant one is Sn. The isotopes possessing even mass numbers have no nuclear spin while the odd ones have a spin of +1/2. Tin, with its three common isotopes Sn, Sn and Sn, is among the easiest elements to detect and analyze by NMR spectroscopy, and its chemical shifts are referenced against SnMe\n4.</p>\n<p>This large number of stable isotopes is thought to be a direct result of tin possessing an atomic number of 50, which is a \"magic number\" in nuclear physics. There are 28 additional unstable isotopes that are known, encompassing all the remaining ones with atomic masses between 99 and 137. Aside from Sn, which has a half-life of 230,000 years, all the radioactive isotopes have a half-life of less than a year. The radioactive Sn is one of the few nuclides possessing a \"doubly magic\" nucleus and was discovered relatively recently, in 1994. Another 30 metastable isomers have been characterized for isotopes between 111 and 131, the most stable of which being Sn, with a half-life of 43.9 years.</p>\n<h2>Etymology</h2>\n<p>The English word 'tin' is Germanic; related words are found in the other Germanic languages—German <i>Zinn</i>, Swedish <i>tenn</i>, Dutch <i>tin</i>, <i>etc.</i>—but not in other branches of Indo-European except by borrowing (<i>e.g.</i> Irish <i>tinne</i>). Its origin is unknown.</p>\n<p>The Latin name <i>stannum</i> originally meant an alloy of silver and lead, and came to mean 'tin' in the 4th century BCE—the earlier Latin word for it was <i>plumbum candidum</i> 'white lead'. <i>Stannum</i> apparently came from an earlier <i>stāgnum</i> (meaning the same substance), the origin of the Romance and Celtic terms for 'tin'. The origin of <i>stannum</i>/<i>stāgnum</i> is unknown; it may be pre-Indo-European. The <i>Meyers Konversationslexikon</i> speculates on the contrary that <i>stannum</i> is derived from Cornish <i>stean</i>, and is proof that Cornwall in the first centuries AD was the main source of tin.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>Main article: Tin sources and trade in ancient times</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCeremonial giant bronze dirk of the Plougrescant-Ommerschans type, Plougrescant, France, 1500–1300 BC.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><b>Tin</b> extraction and use can be dated to the beginnings of the Bronze Age around 3000 BC, when it was observed that copper objects formed of polymetallic ores with different metal contents had different physical properties. The earliest bronze objects had tin or arsenic content of less than 2% and are therefore believed to be the result of unintentional alloying due to trace metal content in the copper ore. The addition of a second metal to copper increases its hardness, lowers the melting temperature, and improves the casting process by producing a more fluid melt that cools to a denser, less spongy metal. This was an important innovation that allowed for the much more complex shapes cast in closed moulds of the Bronze Age. Arsenical bronze objects appear first in the Near East where arsenic is commonly found in association with copper ore, but the health risks were quickly realized and the quest for sources of the much less hazardous tin ores began early in the Bronze Age. This created the demand for rare tin metal and formed a trade network that linked the distant sources of tin to the markets of Bronze Age cultures.</p>\n<p>Cassiterite (SnO), the tin oxide form of tin, was most likely the original source of tin in ancient times. Other forms of tin ores are less abundant sulfides such as stannite that require a more involved smelting process. Cassiterite often accumulates in alluvial channels as placer deposits due to the fact that it is harder, heavier, and more chemically resistant than the granite in which it typically forms. These deposits can be easily seen in river banks as cassiterite is usually black, purple or otherwise dark in color, a feature exploited by early Bronze Age prospectors. It is likely that the earliest deposits were alluvial in nature, and perhaps exploited by the same methods used for panning gold in placer deposits.</p>\n<h2>Compounds and chemistry</h2>\n<div>See also category: Tin compounds</div>\n<p>In the great majority of its compounds, tin has the oxidation state II or IV.</p>\n<h3>Inorganic compounds</h3>\n<p>Halide compounds are known for both oxidation states. For Sn(IV), all four halides are well known: SnF, SnCl, SnBr, and SnI. The three heavier members are volatile molecular compounds, whereas the tetrafluoride is polymeric. All four halides are known for Sn(II) also: SnF, SnCl, SnBr, and SnI. All are polymeric solids. Of these eight compounds, only the iodides are colored.</p>\n<p>Tin(II) chloride (also known as stannous chloride) is the most important tin halide in a commercial sense. Illustrating the routes to such compounds, chlorine reacts with tin metal to give SnCl whereas the reaction of hydrochloric acid and tin gives SnCl and hydrogen gas. Alternatively SnCl and Sn combine to stannous chloride via a process called comproportionation:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>SnCl + Sn → 2 SnCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Tin can form many oxides, sulfides, and other chalcogenide derivatives. The dioxide SnO (cassiterite) forms when tin is heated in the presence of air. SnO is amphoteric, which means that it dissolves in both acidic and basic solutions. There are also stannates with the structure [Sn(OH)], like K[Sn(OH)], although the free stannic acid H[Sn(OH)] is unknown. The sulfides of tin exist in both the +2 and +4 oxidation states: tin(II) sulfide and tin(IV) sulfide (mosaic gold).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBall-and-stick models of the structure of solid stannous chloride (SnCl).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Hydrides</h3>\n<p>Stannane (SnH), where tin is in the +4 oxidation state, is unstable. Organotin hydrides are however well known, e.g. tributyltin hydride (Sn(CH)H). These compound release transient tributyl tin radicals, rare examples of compounds of tin(III).</p>\n<h3>Organotin compounds</h3>\n<p>Organotin compounds, sometimes called stannanes, are chemical compounds with tin-carbon bonds. Of the compounds of tin, the organic derivatives are the most useful commercially. Some organotin compounds are highly toxic and have been used as biocides. The first organotin compound to be reported was diethyltin diiodide ((CH)SnI), reported by Edward Frankland in 1849.</p>\n<p>Most organotin compounds are colorless liquids or solids that are stable to air and water. They adopt tetrahedral geometry. Tetraalkyl- and tetraaryltin compounds can be prepared using Grignard reagents:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>SnCl\n4 + 4 RMgBr → R\n4Sn + 4 MgBrCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The mixed halide-alkyls, which are more common and more important commercially than the tetraorgano derivatives, are prepared by redistribution reactions:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>SnCl\n4 + R\n4Sn → 2 SnClR</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Divalent organotin compounds are uncommon, although more common than related divalent organogermanium and organosilicon compounds. The greater stabilization enjoyed by Sn(II) is attributed to the \"inert pair effect\". Organotin(II) compounds include both stannylenes (formula: RSn, as seen for singlet carbenes) and distannylenes (RSn), which are roughly equivalent to alkenes. Both classes exhibit unusual reactions.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>See also category: Tin minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSample of cassiterite, the main ore of tin.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGranular pieces of cassiterite, which are collected by placer mining</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tin is generated via the long S-process in low-to-medium mass stars (with masses of 0.6 to 10 times that of Sun). It arises via beta decay of heavy isotopes of indium.</p>\n<p>Tin is the 49th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, representing 2&nbsp;ppm compared with 75&nbsp;ppm for zinc, 50&nbsp;ppm for copper, and 14&nbsp;ppm for lead.</p>\n<p>Tin does not occur as the native element but must be extracted from various ores. Cassiterite (SnO) is the only commercially important source of tin, although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex sulfides such as stannite, cylindrite, franckeite, canfieldite, and teallite. Minerals with tin are almost always associated with granite rock, usually at a level of 1% tin oxide content.</p>\n<p>Because of the higher specific gravity of tin dioxide, about 80% of mined tin is from secondary deposits found downstream from the primary lodes. Tin is often recovered from granules washed downstream in the past and deposited in valleys or under sea. The most economical ways of mining tin are through dredging, hydraulic methods or open cast mining. Most of the world's tin is produced from placer deposits, which may contain as little as 0.015% tin.</p>\n\n<p>About 253,000 tonnes of tin have been mined in 2011, mostly in China (110,000 t), Indonesia (51,000 t), Peru (34,600 t), Bolivia (20,700 t) and Brazil (12,000 t). Estimates of tin production have historically varied with the dynamics of economic feasibility and the development of mining technologies, but it is estimated that, at current consumption rates and technologies, the Earth will run out of tin that can be mined in 40 years. However Lester Brown has suggested tin could run out within 20 years based on an extremely conservative extrapolation of 2% growth per year.</p>\n\n<p>Secondary, or scrap, tin is also an important source of the metal. The recovery of tin through secondary production, or recycling of scrap tin, is increasing rapidly. Whereas the United States has neither mined since 1993 nor smelted tin since 1989, it was the largest secondary producer, recycling nearly 14,000 tonnes in 2006.</p>\n<p>New deposits are reported to be in southern Mongolia, and in 2009, new deposits of tin were discovered in Colombia, South America, by the Seminole Group Colombia CI, SAS.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Tin is produced by carbothermic reduction of the oxide ore with carbon or coke. Both reverberatory furnace and electric furnace can be used.</p>\n<h3>Mining and smelting</h3>\n<div>Main article: Tin mining</div>\n<h3>Industry</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCandlestick made of tin</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The ten largest companies produced most of world's tin in 2007. It is not clear which of these companies include tin smelted from the mine at Bisie, Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is controlled by a renegade militia and produces 15,000 tonnes. Most of the world's tin is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME), from 8 countries, under 17 brands.</p>\n\n<div></div>\n<h2>Price and exchanges</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld production and price (US exchange) of tin.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tin is unique among other mineral commodities by the complex \"agreements\" between producer countries and consumer countries dating back to 1921. The earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and sporadic; they led to the “First International Tin Agreement” in 1956, the first of a continuously numbered series that essentially collapsed in 1985. Through this series of agreements, the International Tin Council (ITC) had a considerable effect on tin prices. The ITC supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling tin from the stockpile. This was an anti-free-market approach, designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to consumer countries and a decent profit for producer countries. However, the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large, and during most of those 29 years tin prices rose, sometimes sharply, especially from 1973 through 1980 when rampant inflation plagued many world economies.</p>\n<p>During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. Government tin stockpile was in an aggressive selling mode, partly to take advantage of the historically high tin prices. The sharp recession of 1981–82 proved to be quite harsh on the tin industry. Tin consumption declined dramatically. The ITC was able to avoid truly steep declines through accelerated buying for its buffer stockpile; this activity required the ITC to borrow extensively from banks and metal trading firms to augment its resources. The ITC continued to borrow until late 1985, when it reached its credit limit. Immediately, a major “tin crisis” followed — tin was delisted from trading on the London Metal Exchange for about 3 years, the ITC dissolved soon afterward, and the price of tin, now in a free-market environment, plummeted sharply to $4 per pound and remained around this level through 1990s. It increased again by 2010 due to rebound in consumption following the 2008–09 world economic crisis, restocking and continued growth in consumption in the world’s developing economies.</p>\n<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) is the principal trading site for tin. Other tin contract markets are Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) and Indonesia Tin Exchange (INATIN).</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld consumption of refined tin by end use, 2006</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 2006, about half of tin produced was used in solder. The rest was divided between tin plating, tin chemicals, brass and bronze, and niche uses.</p>\n<h3>Solder</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA coil of lead-free solder wire</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tin has long been used as a solder in the form of an alloy with lead, tin accounting for 5 to 70% w/w. Tin forms a eutectic mixture with lead containing 63% tin and 37% lead. Such solders are primarily used for solders for joining pipes or electric circuits. Since the European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive came into effect on 1 July 2006, the use of lead in such alloys has decreased. Replacing lead has many problems, including a higher melting point, and the formation of tin whiskers causing electrical problems. Tin pest can occur in lead-free solders, leading to loss of the soldered joint. Replacement alloys are rapidly being found, although problems of joint integrity remain.</p>\n<h3>Tin plating</h3>\n<p>Tin bonds readily to iron and is used for coating lead or zinc and steel to prevent corrosion. Tin-plated steel containers are widely used for food preservation, and this forms a large part of the market for metallic tin. A tinplate canister for preserving food was first manufactured in London in 1812. Speakers of British English call them \"tins\", while speakers of American English call them \"cans\" or \"tin cans\". One thus-derived use of the slang term \"tinnie\" or \"tinny\" means \"can of beer\". The tin whistle is so called because it was first mass-produced in tin-plated steel.</p>\n<h3>Specialized alloys</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPewter plate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tin in combination with other elements forms a wide variety of useful alloys. Tin is most commonly alloyed with copper. Pewter is 85–99% tin; Bearing metal has a high percentage of tin as well. Bronze is mostly copper (12% tin), while addition of phosphorus gives phosphor bronze. Bell metal is also a copper-tin alloy, containing 22% tin. Tin has also sometimes been used in coinage; for example, it once formed a single figure percentage of the American and Canadian pennies. Because copper is often the major metal in such coins, and zinc is sometimes present as well, these could technically be called bronze and/or brass alloys.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTin plated metal from can</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The niobium-tin compound NbSn is commercially used as wires for superconducting magnets, due to the material's high critical temperature (18&nbsp;K) and critical magnetic field (25&nbsp;T). A superconducting magnet weighing only a couple of kilograms is capable of producing magnetic fields comparable to a conventional electromagnet weighing tons.</p>\n<p>A addition of a few percent tin is commonly used in zirconium alloys for the cladding of nuclear fuel.</p>\n<p>Most metal pipes in a pipe organ are made of varying amounts of a tin/lead alloy, with 50%/50% being the most common. The amount of tin in the pipe defines the pipe's tone, since tin is the most tonally resonant of all metals. When a tin/lead alloy cools, the lead cools slightly faster and produces a mottled or spotted effect. This metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal. Major advantages of using tin for pipes include its appearance, its workability, and resistance to corrosion.</p>\n<h3>Other applications</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA 21st-century reproduction barn lantern made of punched tin.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Punched tin, also called pierced tin, is an artisan technique originating in central Europe for creating housewares that are both functional and decorative. Decorative piercing designs exist in a wide variety, based on geography or the artisan's personal creations. Punched tin lanterns are the most common application of this artisan technique. The light of a candle shining through the pierced design creates a decorative light pattern in the room where it sits. Punched tin lanterns and other punched tin articles were created in the New World from the earliest European settlement. A well-known example is the Revere type lantern, named after Paul Revere.</p>\n<p>Before the modern era, in some areas of the Alps, a goat or sheep's horn would be sharpened and a tin panel would be punched out using the alphabet and numbers from one to nine. This learning tool was known appropriately as \"the horn\". Modern reproductions are decorated with such motifs as hearts and tulips.</p>\n<p>In America, pie safes and food safes came into use in the days before refrigeration. These were wooden cupboards of various styles and sizes – either floor standing or hanging cupboards meant to discourage vermin and insects and to keep dust from perishable foodstuffs. These cabinets had tinplate inserts in the doors and sometimes in the sides, punched out by the homeowner, cabinetmaker or a tinsmith in varying designs to allow for air circulation. Modern reproductions of these articles remain popular in North America.</p>\n<p>Window glass is most often made by floating molten glass on top of molten tin (creating float glass) in order to produce a flat surface. This is called the \"Pilkington process\".</p>\n<p>Tin is also used as a negative electrode in advanced Li-ion batteries. Its application is somewhat limited by the fact that some tin surfaces catalyze decomposition of carbonate-based electrolytes used in Li-ion batteries.</p>\n<p>Tin(II) fluoride is added to some dental care products as stannous fluoride (SnF). Tin(II) fluoride can be mixed with calcium abrasives while the more common sodium fluoride gradually becomes biologically inactive combined with calcium compounds. It has also been shown to be more effective than sodium fluoride in controlling gingivitis.</p>\n<h3>Organotin compounds</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organotin chemistry</div>\n<p>Of all the chemical compounds of tin, the organotin compounds are most heavily used. Worldwide industrial production probably exceeds 50,000 tonnes.</p>\n<h4>PVC stabilizers</h4>\n<p>The major commercial application of organotin compounds is in the stabilization of PVC plastics. In the absence of such stabilizers, PVC would otherwise rapidly degrade under heat, light, and atmospheric oxygen, to give discolored, brittle products. Tin scavenges labile chloride ions (Cl), which would otherwise initiate loss of HCl from the plastic material. Typical tin compounds are carboxylic acid derivatives of dibutyltin dichloride, such as the dilaurate.</p>\n<h4>Biocides</h4>\n<p>Organotin compounds can have a relatively high toxicity, which is both advantageous and problematic. They have been used for their biocidal effects in/as fungicides, pesticides, algaecides, wood preservatives, and antifouling agents. Tributyltin oxide is used as a wood preservative. Tributyltin was used as additive for ship paint to prevent growth of marine organisms on ships, with use declining after organotin compounds were recognized as persistent organic pollutants with an extremely high toxicity for some marine organisms, for example the dog whelk. The EU banned the use of organotin compounds in 2003, while concerns over the toxicity of these compounds to marine life and their effects on the reproduction and growth of some marine species, (some reports describe biological effects to marine life at a concentration of 1 nanogram per liter) have led to a worldwide ban by the International Maritime Organization. Many nations now restrict the use of organotin compounds to vessels over 25 meters long.</p>\n<h4>Organic chemistry</h4>\n<p>Some tin reagents are useful in organic chemistry. In the largest application, stannous chloride is a common reducing agent for the conversion of nitro and oxime groups to amines. The Stille reaction couples organotin compounds with organic halides or pseudohalides.</p>\n<h4>Li-ion batteries</h4>\n<p>Tin forms several inter-metallic phases with Lithium metal and it makes it a potentially attractive material. Large volumetric expansion of tin upon alloying with Lithium and instability of the Tin-organic electrolyte interface at low electrochemical potentials are the greatest challenges in employing it in commercial cells. The problem was partially solved by Sony. Tin inter-metallic compound with Cobalt, mixed with carbon, has been implemented by Sony in its Nexelion cells released in late 2000's. The composition of the active materials is close to SnCoC. Recent research showed that only some crystalline facets of tetragonal (beta) Sn are responsible for undesirable electrochemical activity.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n\n<div>Main article: Tin poisoning</div>\n<p>Cases of poisoning from tin metal, its oxides, and its salts are \"almost unknown\". On the other hand, certain organotin compounds are almost as toxic as cyanide.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Cassiterides (the mythical Tin Islands)</li>\n<li>Stannary</li>\n<li>Terne</li>\n<li>Tin pest</li>\n<li>Tin mining in Britain</li>\n<li>Tinning</li>\n<li>Whisker (metallurgy) (tin whiskers)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Only H, F, P, Tl and Xe have a higher receptivity for NMR analysis for samples containing isotopes at their natural abundance.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ \"SnH3\".

  "html": "<div>This article is about the element.  For the town, see Antimony, Utah.  For the mountain, see Antimony Peak.</div>\n<p><i>For the paradox, see Antinomy.</i></p>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Antimony</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Sb</b> (from Latin: stibium) and atomic number&nbsp;51. A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (SbS). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics; metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as lead. It was established to be an element around the 17th century.</p>\n<p>For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan. The industrial methods to produce antimony are roasting and subsequent carbothermal reduction or direct reduction of stibnite with iron.</p>\n<p>The largest applications for metallic antimony are as alloying material for lead and tin and for lead antimony plates in lead-acid batteries. Alloying lead and tin with antimony improves the properties of the alloys which are used in solders, bullets and plain bearings. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine- and bromine-containing fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products. An emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA vial containing the black allotrope of antimony</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNative antimony with oxidation products</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCrystal structure common to Sb, AsSb and gray As</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Antimony is in the nitrogen group (group 15) and has an electronegativity of 2.05. As expected by periodic trends, it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth, and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic. Antimony is stable in air at room temperature, but reacts with oxygen if heated to form antimony trioxide, SbO.</p>\n<p>Antimony is a silvery, lustrous gray metal that has a Mohs scale hardness of 3. Therefore, pure antimony is not used to make hard objects: coins made of antimony were issued in China's Guizhou province in 1931, but because of their rapid wear, their minting was discontinued. Antimony is resistant to attack by acids.</p>\n<p>Four allotropes of antimony are known: a stable metallic form and three metastable forms (explosive, black and yellow). Metallic antimony is a brittle, silver-white shiny metal. When molten antimony is slowly cooled, metallic antimony crystallizes in a trigonal cell, isomorphic with that of the gray allotrope of arsenic. A rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony trichloride. When scratched with a sharp implement, an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony is formed; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of vapor derived from metallic antimony. It has the same crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic, it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously. At 100 °C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of stibine (SbH) at −90 °C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.</p>\n<p>Metallic antimony adopts a layered structure (space group R3m No. 166) in which layers consist of fused ruffled six-membered rings. The nearest and next-nearest neighbors form a distorted octahedral complex, with the three atoms in the same double-layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next. This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 6.697&nbsp;g/cm, but the weak bonding between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of antimony</div>\n<p>Antimony exists as two stable isotopes, Sb with a natural abundance of 57.36% and Sb with a natural abundance of 42.64%. It also has 35 radioisotopes, of which the longest-lived is Sb with a half-life of 2.75&nbsp;years. In addition, 29 metastable states have been characterized. The most stable of these is Sb with a half-life of 60.20&nbsp;days, which has an application in some neutron sources. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable Sb tend to decay by β decay, and those that are heavier tend to decay by β decay, with some exceptions.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also: Category:Antimonide minerals&nbsp;and Category:Antimonate minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStibnite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The abundance of antimony in the Earth's crust is estimated at 0.2 to 0.5 parts per million, comparable to thallium at 0.5 parts per million and silver at 0.07 ppm. Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in over 100 mineral species. Antimony is sometimes found natively, but more frequently it is found in the sulfide stibnite (SbS) which is the predominant ore mineral.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also: Category:Antimony compounds</div>\n<p>Antimony compounds are often classified into those of Sb(III) and Sb(V). Relative to its congener arsenic, the +5 oxidation state is more stable.</p>\n<h3>Oxides and hydroxides</h3>\n<p>Antimony trioxide (Sb\n4O\n6) is formed when antimony is burnt in air. In the gas phase, this compound exists as Sb\n4O\n6, but it polymerizes upon condensing. Antimony pentoxide (Sb\n4O\n10) can only be formed by oxidation by concentrated nitric acid. Antimony also forms a mixed-valence oxide, antimony tetroxide (Sb\n2O\n4), which features both Sb(III) and Sb(V). Unlike phosphorus and arsenic, these various oxides are amphoteric, do not form well-defined oxoacids and react with acids to form antimony salts.</p>\n<p>Antimonous acid Sb(OH)\n3 is unknown, but the conjugate base sodium antimonite ([Na\n3SbO\n3]\n4) forms upon fusing sodium oxide and Sb\n4O\n6. Transition metal antimonites are also known. Antimonic acid exists only as the hydrate HSb(OH)\n6, forming salts containing the antimonate anion Sb(OH)−\n6. Dehydrating metal salts containing this anion yields mixed oxides.</p>\n<p>Many antimony ores are sulfides, including stibnite (Sb\n2S\n3), pyrargyrite (Ag\n3SbS\n3), zinkenite, jamesonite, and boulangerite. Antimony pentasulfide is non-stoichiometric and features antimony in the +3 oxidation state and S-S bonds. Several thioantimonides are known, such as [Sb\n6S\n10]2− and [Sb\n8S\n13]2−.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<p>Antimony forms two series of halides, SbX\n3 and SbX\n5. The trihalides SbF\n3, SbCl\n3, SbBr\n3, and SbI\n3 are all molecular compounds having trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry. The trifluoride SbF\n3 is prepared by the reaction of Sb\n2O\n3 with HF:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Sb\n2O\n3 + 6 HF → 2 SbF\n3 + 3 H\n2O</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It is Lewis acidic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions SbF−\n4 and SbF2−\n5. Molten SbF\n3 is a weak electrical conductor. The trichloride SbCl\n3 is prepared by dissolving Sb\n2S\n3 in hydrochloric acid:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Sb\n2S\n3 + 6 HCl → 2 SbCl\n3 + 3 H\n2S</dd>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of gaseous SbF</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The pentahalides SbF\n5 and SbCl\n5 have trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry in the gas phase, but in the liquid phase, SbF\n5 is polymeric, whereas SbCl\n5 is monomeric. SbF\n5 is a powerful Lewis acid used to make the superacid fluoroantimonic acid (\"HSbF\").</p>\n<p>Oxyhalides are more common for antimony than arsenic and phosphorus. Antimony trioxide dissolves in concentrated acid to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as SbOCl and (SbO)\n2SO\n4.</p>\n<h3>Antimonides, hydrides, and organoantimony compounds</h3>\n<p>Compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of Sb. Antimony forms antimonides with metals, such as indium antimonide (InSb) and silver antimonide (Ag\n3Sb). The alkali metal and zinc antimonides, such as NaSb and ZnSb, are more reactive. Treating these antimonides with acid produces the unstable gas stibine, SbH\n3:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Sb3− + 3 H+ → SbH\n3</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Stibine can also be produced by treating Sb3+ salts with hydride reagents such as sodium borohydride. Stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature. Because stibine has a positive heat of formation, it is thermodynamically unstable and thus antimony does not react with hydrogen directly.</p>\n<p>Organoantimony compounds are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with Grignard reagents. A large variety of compounds are known with both Sb(III) and Sb(V) centers, including mixed chloro-organic derivatives, anions, and cations. Examples include Sb(CH) (triphenylstibine), Sb(CH) (with an Sb-Sb bond), and cyclic [Sb(CH)]. Pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common, examples being Sb(CH) and several related halides.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOne of the alchemical symbols for antimony</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Antimony(III) sulfide, SbS, was recognized in predynastic Egypt as an eye cosmetic (kohl) as early as about 3100 BC, when the cosmetic palette was invented.</p>\n<p>An artifact, said to be part of a vase, made of antimony dating to about 3000 BC was found at Telloh, Chaldea (part of present-day Iraq), and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 BC and 2200 BC has been found in Egypt. Austen, at a lecture by Herbert Gladstone in 1892 commented that \"we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal, which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase, and therefore this remarkable 'find' (artifact mentioned above) must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable.\"</p>\n<p>Moorey was unconvinced the artifact was indeed a vase, mentioning that Selimkhanov, after his analysis of the Tello object (published in 1975), \"attempted to relate the metal to Transcaucasian natural antimony\" (i.e. native metal) and that \"the antimony objects from Transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments.\" This weakens the evidence for a lost art \"of rendering antimony malleable.\"</p>\n<p>The first European description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the book <i>De la pirotechnia</i> of 1540 by Vannoccio Biringuccio; this predates the more famous 1556 book by Agricola, <i>De re metallica</i>. In this context Agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony. The book <i>Currus Triumphalis Antimonii</i> (The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony), describing the preparation of metallic antimony, was published in Germany in 1604. It was purported to have been written by a Benedictine monk, writing under the name Basilius Valentinus, in the 15th century; if it were authentic, which it is not, it would predate Biringuccio.</p>\n<p>Pure antimony was well known to Jābir ibn Hayyān in the 8th century. There is an ongoing controversy, with translator Marcellin Berthelot stating antimony was never found in Jābir's books, but others claiming that Berthelot translated only some of the less important books, while the more interesting ones (some of which might describe antimony) are not yet translated, and their content is completely unknown.</p>\n<p>The first natural occurrence of pure antimony in the Earth's crust was described by the Swedish scientist and local mine district engineer Anton von Swab in 1783; the type-sample was collected from the Sala Silver Mine in the Bergslagen mining district of Sala, Västmanland, Sweden.</p>\n<h3>Etymology</h3>\n<p>The ancient words for antimony mostly have, as their chief meaning, kohl, the sulfide of antimony. Pliny the Elder, however, distinguishes between male and female forms of antimony; the male form is probably the sulfide, while the female form, which is superior, heavier, and less friable, has been suspected to be native metallic antimony.</p>\n<p>The Egyptians called antimony <i>mśdmt</i>; in hieroglyphs, the vowels are uncertain, but there is an Arabic tradition that the word is ميسديميت <i>mesdemet</i>. The Greek word, στίμμι <i>stimmi</i>, is probably a loan word from Arabic or Egyptian <i>sdm</i></p>\n\n<p>and is used by Attic tragic poets of the 5th century BC; later Greeks also used στἰβι <i>stibi</i>, as did Celsus and Pliny, writing in Latin, in the first century AD. Pliny also gives the names <i>stimi</i>  [<i>sic</i>], <i>larbaris</i>, alabaster, and the \"very common\" <i>platyophthalmos</i>, \"wide-eye\" (from the effect of the cosmetic). Later Latin authors adapted the word to Latin as <i>stibium</i>. The Arabic word for the substance, as opposed to the cosmetic, can appear as إثمد <i>ithmid, athmoud, othmod</i>, or <i>uthmod</i>. Littré suggests the first form, which is the earliest, derives from <i>stimmida</i>, an accusative for <i>stimmi</i>.</p>\n<p>The use of Sb as the standard chemical symbol for antimony is due to Jöns Jakob Berzelius, who used this abbreviation of the name <i>stibium</i>. The medieval Latin form, from which the modern languages and late Byzantine Greek take their names for antimony, is <i>antimonium</i>. The origin of this is uncertain; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation. The popular etymology, from ἀντίμοναχός <i>anti-monachos</i> or French <i>antimoine</i>, still has adherents; this would mean \"monk-killer\", and is explained by many early alchemists being monks, and antimony being poisonous.</p>\n<p>Another popular etymology is the hypothetical Greek word ἀντίμόνος <i>antimonos</i>, \"against aloneness\", explained as \"not found as metal\", or \"not found unalloyed\". Lippmann conjectured a hypothetical Greek word ανθήμόνιον <i>anthemonion</i>, which would mean \"floret\", and cites several examples of related Greek words (but not that one) which describe chemical or biological efflorescence.</p>\n<p>The early uses of <i>antimonium</i> include the translations, in 1050–1100, by Constantine the African of Arabic medical treatises. Several authorities believe <i>antimonium</i> is a scribal corruption of some Arabic form; Meyerhof derives it from <i>ithmid</i>; other possibilities include <i>athimar</i>, the Arabic name of the metalloid, and a hypothetical <i>as-stimmi</i>, derived from or parallel to the Greek.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld antimony output in 2010.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld production trend of antimony.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Top producers and production volumes</h3>\n<p>The British Geological Survey reported that in 2005, the People's Republic of China was the top producer of antimony with an approximately 84% world share, followed at a distance by South Africa, Bolivia and Tajikistan. Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan province has the largest deposits in China with an estimated deposit of 2.1 million metric tons.</p>\n<p>In 2010, according to the US Geological Survey, China accounted for 88.9% of total antimony production with South Africa, Bolivia and Russia sharing the second place.</p>\n\n<p>However, Roskill Consulting estimates for primary production show that in 2010 China held a 76.75% share of world's supply with 120,462 tonnes (90,000 tonnes of reported and 30,464 tonnes of un-reported production), followed by Russia (4.14% share, 6,500 tonnes of production), Myanmar (3.76% share, 5,897 tonnes), Canada (3.61% share, 5,660 tonnes), Tajikistan (3.42% share, 5,370 tonnes) and Bolivia (3.17% share, 4,980 tonnes).</p>\n<p>Roskill estimates that secondary production globally in 2010 was 39,540 tonnes.</p>\n<p>Antimony was ranked first in a Risk List published by the British Geological Survey in the second half 2011. The list provides an indication of the relative risk to the supply of chemical elements or element groups required to maintain the current British economy and lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Also, antimony was identified as one of 12 critical raw materials for the EU in a report published in 2011, primarily due to the lack of supply outside China.</p>\n<p>Reported production of antimony in China fell in 2010 and is unlikely to increase in the coming years, according to the Roskill report. No significant antimony deposits in China have been developed for about ten years, and the remaining economic reserves are being rapidly depleted.</p>\n<p>The world's largest antimony producers, according to Roskill, are listed below:</p>\n\n<h3>Reserves</h3>\n<p>According to statistics from the US Geological Survey (USGS), current global reserves of antimony will be depleted in 13 years. However, the United States Geological Survey expects more resources will be found.</p>\n\n<h3>Production process</h3>\n<p>The extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality of the ore and composition of the ore. Most antimony is mined as the sulfide; lower grade ores are concentrated by froth flotation, while higher grade ores are heated to 500–600 °C, the temperature at which stibnite melts and is separated from the gangue minerals. Antimony can be isolated from the crude antimony sulfide by a reduction with scrap iron:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Sb\n2S\n3 + 3 Fe → 2 Sb + 3 FeS</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The sulfide is converted to an oxide and advantage is often taken of the volatility of antimony(III) oxide, which is recovered from roasting. This material is often used directly for the main applications, impurities being arsenic and sulfide. Isolating antimony from its oxide is performed by a carbothermal reduction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Sb\n2O\n3 + 3 C → 4 Sb + 3 CO\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The lower grade ores are reduced in blast furnaces while the higher grade ores are reduced in reverberatory furnaces.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>About 60% of antimony is consumed in flame retardants, and 20% is used in alloys for batteries, plain bearings and solders.</p>\n<h3>Flame retardants</h3>\n<p>Antimony is mainly used as its trioxide in making flame-proofing compounds. It is nearly always used in combination with halogenated flame retardants, with the only exception being in halogen-containing polymers. The formation of halogenated antimony compounds is the cause for the flame retarding effect of antimony trioxide, due to reaction of these compounds with hydrogen atoms and probably also with oxygen atoms and OH radicals, thus inhibiting fire. Markets for these flame-retardant applications include children's clothing, toys, aircraft and automobile seat covers. It is also used in the fiberglass composites industry as an additive to polyester resins for such items as light aircraft engine covers. The resin will burn while a flame is held to it but will extinguish itself as soon as the flame is removed.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>Antimony forms a highly useful alloy with lead, increasing its hardness and mechanical strength. For most applications involving lead, varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal. In lead–acid batteries, this addition improves the charging characteristics and reduces generation of unwanted hydrogen during charging. It is used in antifriction alloys (such as Babbitt metal), in bullets and lead shot, cable sheathing, type metal (for example, for linotype printing machines), solder (some \"lead-free\" solders contain 5% Sb), in pewter, and in hardening alloys with low tin content in the manufacturing of organ pipes.</p>\n<h3>Other applications</h3>\n<p>Three other applications make up nearly all the rest of the consumption. One of these uses is as a stabilizer and a catalyst for the production of polyethyleneterephthalate. Another application is to serve as a fining agent to remove microscopic bubbles in glass, mostly for TV screens; this is achieved by the interaction of antimony ions with oxygen, interfering the latter from forming bubbles. The third major application is the use as pigment.</p>\n<p>Antimony is being increasingly used in the semiconductor industry as a dopant for heavily doped n-type silicon wafers in the production of diodes, infrared detectors, and Hall-effect devices. In the 1950s, tiny beads of a lead-antimony alloy were used to dope the emitters and collectors of n-p-n alloy junction transistors with antimony. Indium antimonide is used as a material for mid-infrared detectors.</p>\n<p>Few biological or medical applications exist for antimony. Treatments principally containing antimony are known as antimonials and are used as emetics. Antimony compounds are used as antiprotozoan drugs. Potassium antimonyl tartrate, or tartar emetic, was once used as an anti-schistosomal drug from 1919 on. It was subsequently replaced by praziquantel. Antimony and its compounds are used in several veterinary preparations like anthiomaline or lithium antimony thiomalate, which is used as a skin conditioner in ruminants. Antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on keratinized tissues, at least in animals.</p>\n<p>Antimony-based drugs, such as meglumine antimoniate, are also considered the drugs of choice for treatment of leishmaniasis in domestic animals. Unfortunately, as well as having low therapeutic indices, the drugs are poor at penetrating the bone marrow, where some of the <i>Leishmania</i> amastigotes reside, and so cure of the disease – especially the visceral form – is very difficult. Elemental antimony as an antimony pill was once used as a medicine. It could be reused by others after ingestion.</p>\n<p>In the heads of some safety matches, antimony(III) sulfide is used. Antimony-124 is used together with beryllium in neutron sources; the gamma rays emitted by antimony-124 initiate the photodisintegration of beryllium. The emitted neutrons have an average energy of 24 keV. Antimony sulfides have been shown to help stabilize the friction coefficient in automotive brake pad materials.</p>\n<p>Antimony also is used in the making of bullets and bullet tracers. This element is also used in traditional cosmetics, event paint and glass art crafts. An application as an opacifier in enamel declined in use after the 1930s, after several intoxications were reported.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Antimony and many of its compounds are toxic, and the effects of antimony poisoning are similar to arsenic poisoning. The toxicity of antimony is by far lower than that of arsenic; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake, metabolism and excretion between arsenic and antimony. The uptake of antimony(III) or antimony(V) in the gastrointestinal tract is at most 20%. Antimony(V) is not quantitatively reduced to antimony(III) in the cell (in fact antimony(III) is oxidised to antimony(V) instead).</p>\n<p>Since methylation of antimony does not occur, the excretion of antimony(V) in urine is the main way of elimination. Like arsenic, the most serious effect of acute antimony poisoning is cardiotoxicity and the resulted myocarditis, however it can also manifest as Adams–Stokes syndrome which arsenic doesn't. Reported cases of intoxication by antimony equivalent to 90&nbsp;mg antimony potassium tartrate dissolved from enamel has been reported to show only short term effects. An intoxication with 6&nbsp;g of antimony potassium tartrate was reported to result in death after 3 days.</p>\n<p>Inhalation of antimony dust is harmful and in certain cases may be fatal; in small doses, antimony causes headaches, dizziness, and depression. Larger doses such as prolonged skin contact may cause dermatitis, or damage the kidneys and the liver, causing violent and frequent vomiting, leading to death in a few days.</p>\n<p>Antimony is incompatible with strong oxidizing agents, strong acids, halogen acids, chlorine, or fluorine. It should be kept away from heat.</p>\n<p>Antimony leaches from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles into liquids. While levels observed for bottled water are below drinking water guidelines, fruit juice concentrates (for which no guidelines are established) produced in the UK were found to contain up to 44.7&nbsp;µg/L of antimony, well above the EU limits for tap water of 5&nbsp;µg/L. The guidelines are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>World Health Organization: 20&nbsp;µg/L</li>\n<li>Japan: 15&nbsp;µg/L</li>\n<li>United States Environmental Protection Agency, Health Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Environment: 6&nbsp;µg/L</li>\n<li>German Federal Ministry of Environment: 5&nbsp;µg/L</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Phase change memory</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Already in 1710 Wilhelm Gottlob Freiherr von Leibniz, after careful inquiry, concluded the work was spurious, there was no monk named Basilius Valentinus, and the book's author was its ostensible editor, Johann Thölde (c. 1565 – c. 1624).

  "title": "Tellurium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Tellurium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Te</b> and atomic number&nbsp;52. A brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid which looks similar to tin, tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form, as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the universe as a whole than it is on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is partly due to its high atomic number, but also due to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused the element to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.</p>\n<p>Tellurium was discovered in Transylvania, a separated Romanian kingdom , in 1782 by Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein in a mineral containing tellurium and gold. Martin Heinrich Klaproth named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for \"earth\", <i>tellus</i>. Gold telluride minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of copper and lead production.</p>\n<p>Commercially, the primary use of tellurium is in alloys, foremost in steel and copper to improve machinability. Applications in solar panels and as a semiconductor material also consume a considerable fraction of tellurium production.</p>\n<p>Tellurium has no biological function, although fungi can incorporate it in place of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine. In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into dimethyl telluride, (CH)Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor which is exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium toxicity or exposure.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>When crystalline, tellurium is silvery-white and when it is in pure state it has a metallic luster. It is a brittle and easily pulverized metalloid. Amorphous tellurium is found by precipitating it from a solution of tellurous or telluric acid (Te(OH)). Tellurium is a semiconductor that shows a greater electrical conductivity in certain directions which depends on atomic alignment; the conductivity increases slightly when exposed to light (photoconductivity). When in its molten state, tellurium is corrosive to copper, iron and stainless steel.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Tellurium adopts a polymeric structure, consisting of zig-zag chains of Te atoms. This gray material resists oxidation by air and is nonvolatile.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of tellurium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring tellurium has eight isotopes. Five of those isotopes, Te, Te, Te, Te and Te, are stable. The other three, Te, Te and Te, have been observed to be radioactive. The stable isotopes make up only 33.2% of the naturally occurring tellurium; this is possibly due to the long half-lives of the unstable isotopes. They are in the range from 10 to 2.2&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 years (for Te). This makes Te the isotope with the longest half life among all radionuclides, which is approximately 160 trillion (10) times the age of known universe.</p>\n<p>There are 38 known nuclear isomers of tellurium with atomic masses that range from 105 to 142. Tellurium is among the lightest elements known to undergo alpha decay, with isotopes Te to Te being able to undergo this mode of decay. The atomic mass of tellurium (127.60&nbsp;g·mol) exceeds that of the following element iodine (126.90&nbsp;g·mol).</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>See also category: Telluride minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTellurium on quartz (Moctezuma, Sonora, Mexico)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNative tellurium crystal on sylvanite (Vatukoula, Viti Levu, Fiji). Picture width 2 mm.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>With an abundance in the Earth's crust comparable to that of platinum, tellurium is one of the rarest stable solid elements in the Earth's crust. Its abundance is about 1&nbsp;µg/kg. In comparison, even the rarest of the lanthanides have crustal abundances of 500&nbsp;µg/kg (see Abundance of the chemical elements).</p>\n<p>The extreme rarity of tellurium in the Earth's crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance, which is in fact greater than that of rubidium, even though rubidium is ten thousand times more abundant in the Earth's crust. The extraordinarily low abundance of tellurium on Earth is rather thought to be due to conditions in the Earth's formation, when the stable form of certain elements, in the absence of oxygen and water, was controlled by the reductive power of free hydrogen. Under this scenario, certain elements such as tellurium which form volatile hydrides were severely depleted during the formation of the Earth's crust, through evaporation of these hydrides. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted in the Earth's crust by this process.</p>\n<p>Tellurium is sometimes found in its native (i.e., elemental) form, but is more often found as the tellurides of gold such as calaverite and krennerite (two different polymorphs of AuTe), petzite, AgAuTe, and sylvanite, AgAuTe. The city of Telluride, Colorado was named in hope of a strike of gold telluride (which never materialized, though gold metal ore was found). Gold itself is usually found uncombined, but when found naturally as a chemical compound, it is most often combined with tellurium (a few rare non-telluride gold compounds such as the antimonide aurostibite, AuSb, and bismuthide maldonite, AuBi, are also known).</p>\n<p>Although tellurium is found with gold more often than in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined with elements other than gold, as tellurides more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium is not in general able to replace sulfur in its minerals, due to the large difference in ion radius of sulfur and tellurium. In consequence, many common sulfide minerals contain considerable amounts of selenium, but only traces of tellurium.</p>\n<p>In the gold rush of 1893, diggers in Kalgoorlie discarded a pyritic material which got in their way as they searched for pure gold. The Kalgoorlie waste was thus used to fill in potholes or as part of sidewalks. Three years passed before it was realized that this waste was calaverite, a telluride of gold that had not been recognized. This led to a second gold rush in 1896 which included mining the streets.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nKlaproth named the new element and credited von Reichenstein with its discovery</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tellurium (Latin <i>tellus</i> meaning \"goddess of the earth\") was discovered in the 18th century in a gold ore from the mines in Zlatna, near today's city of Sibiu, Romania. This ore was known as \"Faczebajer weißes blättriges Golderz\" (white leafy gold ore from Faczebaja, German name of Facebánya, now Faţa Băii in Alba County) or <i>antimonalischer Goldkies</i> (antimonic gold pyrite), and, according to Anton von Rupprecht, was <i>Spießglaskönig</i> (<i>argent molybdique</i>), containing native antimony. In 1782 Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein, who was then serving as the Austrian chief inspector of mines in Transylvania, concluded that the ore did not contain antimony, but that it was bismuth sulfide. The following year, he reported that this was erroneous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to antimony. After a thorough investigation which lasted for three years and consisted of more than fifty tests, Müller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted the radish-like odor of the white smoke which passed off when the new metal was heated, the red color which the metal imparts to sulfuric acid, and the black precipitate which this solution gives when diluted with water. Nevertheless, he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names <i>aurum paradoxium</i> and <i>metallum problematicum</i>, as it did not show the properties predicted for the expected antimony.</p>\n<p>In 1789, another Hungarian scientist, Pál Kitaibel, also discovered the element independently in an ore from Deutsch-Pilsen which had been regarded as argentiferous molybdenite, but later he gave the credit to Müller. In 1798, it was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth who earlier isolated it from the mineral calaverite. The 1960s brought growth in thermoelectric applications for tellurium (as bismuth telluride), as well as its use in free-machining steel, which became the dominant use.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>The principal source of tellurium is from anode sludges produced during the electrolytic refining of blister copper. It is a component of dusts from blast furnace refining of lead. Treatment of 500 tons of copper ore typically yields one pound (0.45&nbsp;kg) of tellurium. Tellurium is produced mainly in the United States, Peru, Japan and Canada. For the year 2009 the British Geological Survey gives the following numbers: United States 50&nbsp;t, Peru 7&nbsp;t, Japan 40&nbsp;t and Canada 16&nbsp;t.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTellurium production 2006</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The anode sludges contain the selenides and tellurides of the noble metals in compounds with the formula MSe or MTe (M = Cu, Ag, Au). At temperatures of 500 °C the anode sludges are roasted with sodium carbonate under air. The metal ions are reduced to the metals, while the telluride is converted to sodium tellurite.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>MTe + O + NaCO → NaTeO + 2 M + CO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Tellurites can be leached from the mixture with water and are normally present as hydrotellurites HTeO in solution. Selenites are also formed during this process, but they can be separated by adding sulfuric acid. The hydrotellurites are converted into the insoluble tellurium dioxide while the selenites stay in solution.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>HTeO−\n3 + OH + HSO → TeO + SO2−\n4 + 2 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The reduction to the metal is done either by electrolysis or by reacting the tellurium dioxide with sulfur dioxide in sulfuric acid.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>TeO + 2 SO + 2HO → Te + SO2−\n4 + 4 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Commercial-grade tellurium is usually marketed as 200-mesh powder but is also available as slabs, ingots, sticks, or lumps. The year-end price for tellurium in 2000 was US$14 per pound. In recent years, the tellurium price was driven up by increased demand and limited supply, reaching as high as US$100 per pound in 2006. Despite an expected doubling in production due to improved extraction methods, the United States Department of Energy (DoE) anticipates a supply shortfall of tellurium by 2025.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Tellurium compounds</div>\n<p>Tellurium belongs to the same chemical family as oxygen, sulfur, selenium and polonium: the chalcogen family. Tellurium and selenium compounds are similar. It exhibits the oxidation states −2, +2, +4 and +6, with the +4 state being most common.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Tellurides</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Reduction of Te metal produces the tellurides and polytellurides, Te. The −2 oxidation state is exhibited in binary compounds with many metals, such as zinc telluride, ZnTe, formed by heating tellurium with zinc. Decomposition of ZnTe with hydrochloric acid yields hydrogen telluride (H\n2Te), a highly unstable analogue of the other chalcogen hydrides, H\n2O, H\n2S and H\n2Se:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>ZnTe + 2 HCl → ZnCl\n2 + H\n2Te</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>H\n2Te is unstable, whereas salts of its conjugate base [TeH] are stable.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Halides</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The +2 oxidation state is exhibited by the dihalides, TeCl\n2, TeBr\n2 and TeI\n2. The dihalides have not been obtained in pure form, although they are known decomposition products of the tetrahalides in organic solvents, and their derived tetrahalotellurates are well-characterized:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Te + X\n2 + 2 X− → TeX2−\n4</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>where X is Cl, Br, or I. These anions are square planar in geometry. Polynuclear anionic species also exist, such as the dark brown Te\n2I2−\n6, and the black Te\n4I2−\n14.</p>\n<p>Fluorine forms two halides with tellurium: the mixed-valence Te\n2F\n4 and TeF\n6. In the +6 oxidation state, the –OTeF\n5 structural group occurs in a number of compounds such as HOTeF\n5, B(OTeF\n5)\n3, Xe(OTeF\n5)\n2, Te(OTeF\n5)\n4 and Te(OTeF\n5)\n6. The square antiprismatic anion TeF2−\n8 is also attested. The other halogens do not form halides with tellurium in the +6 oxidation state, but only tetrahalides (TeCl\n4, TeBr\n4 and TeI\n4) in the +4 state, and other lower halides (Te\n3Cl\n2, Te\n2Cl\n2, Te\n2Br\n2, Te\n2I and two forms of TeI). In the +4 oxidation state, halotellurate anions are known, such as TeCl2−\n6 and Te\n2Cl2−\n10. Halotellurium cations are also attested, including TeI+\n3, found in TeI\n3AsF\n6.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Oxocompounds</dt>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA sample of tellurium dioxide powder</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tellurium monoxide was first reported in 1883 as a black amorphous solid formed by the heat decomposition of TeSO\n3 in vacuum, disproportionating into tellurium dioxide, TeO\n2 and elemental tellurium upon heating. Since then, however, some doubt has been cast on its existence in the solid phase, although it is known as a vapor phase fragment; the black solid may be merely an equimolar mixture of elemental tellurium and tellurium dioxide.</p>\n<p>Tellurium dioxide is formed by heating tellurium in air, causing it to burn with a blue flame. Tellurium trioxide, β-TeO\n3, is obtained by thermal decomposition of Te(OH)\n6. The other two forms of trioxide reported in the literature, the α- and γ- forms, were found not to be true oxides of tellurium in the +6 oxidation state, but a mixture of Te4+, OH− and O−\n2. Tellurium also exhibits mixed-valence oxides, Te\n2O\n5 and Te\n4O\n9.</p>\n<p>The tellurium oxides and hydrated oxides form a series of acids, including tellurous acid (H\n2TeO\n3), orthotelluric acid (Te(OH)\n6) and metatelluric acid ((H\n2TeO\n4)\nn). The two forms of telluric acid form <i>tellurate</i> salts containing the TeO2–\n4 and TeO6−\n6 anions, respectively. Tellurous acid forms <i>tellurite</i> salts containing the anion TeO2−\n3. Other tellurium cations include TeF2+\n8, which consists of two fused tellurium rings and the polymeric TeF2+\n7.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Zintl cations</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>When tellurium is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid, it forms red solutions containing the Zintl ion, Te2+\n4. The oxidation of tellurium by AsF\n5 in liquid SO\n2 also produces this square planar cation, as well as with the trigonal prismatic, yellow-orange Te4+\n6:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Te + 3 AsF\n5 → Te2+\n4(AsF−\n6)\n2 + AsF\n3</dd>\n<dd>6 Te + 6 AsF\n5 → Te4+\n6(AsF−\n6)\n4 + 2 AsF\n3</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Other tellurium Zintl cations include the polymeric Te2+\n7 and the blue-black Te2+\n8, which consists of two fused 5-membered tellurium rings. The latter cation is formed by the reaction of tellurium with tungsten hexachloride:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>8 Te + 2 WCl\n6 → Te2+\n8(WCl−\n6)\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Interchalcogen cations also exist, such as Te\n2Se2+\n6 (distorted cubic geometry) and Te\n2Se2+\n8. These are formed by oxidizing mixtures of tellurium and selenium with AsF\n5 or SbF\n5.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Organotellurium compounds</dt>\n</dl>\n<div>Main article: Organotellurium chemistry</div>\n<p>Tellurium does not readily form analogues of alcohols and thiols, with the functional group –TeH and are called tellurols. The –TeH functional group is also attributed to using the prefix <i>tellanyl-</i>. Like HTe, these species are unstable with respect to loss of hydrogen. Telluraethers (R-Te-R) are more stable as are telluroxides.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Metallurgy</h3>\n<p>The largest consumer of tellurium is metallurgy, where it is used in iron, copper and lead alloys. When added to stainless steel and copper it makes these metals more machinable. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopic purposes, as the presence of electrically conductive free graphite tends to deleteriously affect spark emission testing results. In lead it improves strength and durability and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.</p>\n<h3>Semiconductor and electronic industry uses</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA CdTe photovoltaic array</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tellurium is used in cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar panels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests using this material achieved some of the highest efficiencies for solar cell electric power generation. Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased tellurium demand. If some of the cadmium in CdTe is replaced by zinc then (Cd,Zn)Te is formed which is used in solid-state X-ray detectors.</p>\n<p>Alloyed with both cadmium and mercury, to form mercury cadmium telluride, an infrared sensitive semiconductor material is formed. Organotellurium compounds such as dimethyl telluride, diethyl telluride, diisopropyl telluride, diallyl telluride and methyl allyl telluride are used as precursors for metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy growth of II-VI compound semiconductors. Diisopropyl telluride (DIPTe) is employed as the preferred precursor for achieving the low-temperature growth of CdHgTe by MOVPE. For these processes highest purity metalorganics of both selenium and tellurium are used. The compounds for semiconductor industry and are prepared by adduct purification.</p>\n<p>Tellurium as a tellurium suboxide is used in the media layer of several types of rewritable optical discs, including ReWritable Compact Discs (CD-RW), ReWritable Digital Video Discs (DVD-RW) and ReWritable Blu-ray Discs.</p>\n<p>Tellurium is used in the new phase change memory chips developed by Intel. Bismuth telluride (BiTe) and lead telluride are working elements of thermoelectric devices. Lead telluride is used in far-infrared detectors.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Used to color ceramics.</li>\n<li>The strong increase in optical refraction upon the addition of selenides and tellurides into glass is used in the production of glass fibers for telecommunications. These chalcogenide glasses are widely used.</li>\n<li>Mixtures of selenium and tellurium are used with barium peroxide as oxidizer in the delay powder of electric blasting caps.</li>\n<li>Organic tellurides have been employed as initiators for living radical polymerization and electron-rich mono- and di-tellurides possess antioxidant activity.</li>\n<li>Rubber can be vulcanized with tellurium instead of sulfur or selenium. The rubber produced in this way shows improved heat resistance.</li>\n<li>Tellurite agar is used to identify member of the corynebacterium genus, most typically Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the pathogen responsible for diphtheria.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Tellurium has no known biological function, although fungi can incorporate it in place of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro-cysteine and telluro-methionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds. Most organisms metabolize tellurium partly to form dimethyl telluride although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species. Dimethyl telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Tellurium and tellurium compounds are considered to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic.</p>\n<p>Humans exposed to as little as 0.01&nbsp;mg/m or less in air exude a foul garlic-like odor known as \"tellurium breath\". This is caused from the tellurium being metabolized by the body, converting it from any oxidation state to dimethyl telluride, (CH)Te. This is a volatile compound with a highly pungent garlic-like smell. Even though the metabolic pathways of tellurium are not known, it is generally assumed that they resemble those of the more extensively studied selenium, because the final methylated metabolic products of the two elements are similar.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The 1862 telluric helix of Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Tellurium, mindat.org</li>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^   Ramadan, Shadia E.; Razak, A.

  "title": "Iodine",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Iodine (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Iodine</b> is a chemical element with symbol <b>I</b> and atomic number 53. The name is from Greek ἰοειδής <i>ioeidēs</i>, meaning violet or purple, due to the color of elemental iodine vapor.</p>\n<p>Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition, and industrially in the production of acetic acid and certain polymers. Iodine's relatively high atomic number, low toxicity, and ease of attachment to organic compounds have made it a part of many X-ray contrast materials in modern medicine. Iodine has only one stable isotope. A number of iodine radioisotopes are also used in medical applications.</p>\n<p>Iodine is found on Earth mainly as the highly water-soluble iodide ion, I, which concentrates it in oceans and brine pools. Like the other halogens, free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule I, and then only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygen. In the universe and on Earth, iodine's high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element. However, its presence in ocean water has given it a role in biology. It is the heaviest essential element utilized widely by life in biological functions (only tungsten, employed in enzymes by a few species of bacteria, is heavier). Iodine's rarity in many soils, due to initial low abundance as a crust-element, and also leaching of soluble iodide by rainwater, has led to many deficiency problems in land animals and inland human populations. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities.</p>\n<p>Iodine is required by higher animals, which use it to synthesize thyroid hormones, which contain the element. Because of this function, radioisotopes of iodine are concentrated in the thyroid gland along with nonradioactive iodine. If inhaled, the radioisotope iodine-131, which has a high fission product yield, concentrates in the thyroid, but is easily remedied with non-radioactive potassium iodide treatment.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Under standard conditions, iodine is a bluish-black solid appearing to sublimate into a noxious violet-pink gas, the colour due to absorption of visible light by electronic transitions between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. Melting at 113.7&nbsp;°C, it forms compounds with many elements, but is less reactive than the other members of its group, the halogens, and has some metallic light reflectance.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nIn the gas phase, iodine shows its violet color.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Elemental iodine is slightly soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450&nbsp;ml at 20&nbsp;°C and 1280&nbsp;ml at 50&nbsp;°C; potassium iodide may be added to increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases, while nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapor. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, modifying the energy distribution of iodine's molecular orbitals, hence changing the colour. A metal ion may replace the solvent, in which case the two species exchange electrons, the ion undergoing π backbonding.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nI•PPh charge-transfer complexes in CHCl.

The I molecules tend to interact via the weak van der Waals forces called the London dispersion forces, and this interaction is responsible for the higher melting point compared to more compact halogens, which are also diatomic. Since the atomic size of iodine is larger, its melting point is higher. The solid crystallizes as orthorhombic crystals. The crystal motif in the Hermann–Mauguin notation is Cmca (No 64), Pearson symbol oS8. The I-I bond is relatively weak, with a bond dissociation energy of 36 kcal/mol, and most bonds to iodine are weaker than for the lighter halides. One consequence of this weak bonding is the relatively high tendency of I molecules to dissociate into atomic iodine.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of iodine</div>\n<p>Of the 37 known (characterized) isotopes of iodine, only one, I, is stable.</p>\n<p>The longest-lived radioisotope, I, has a half-life of 15.7 million years. This is long enough to make it a permanent fixture of the environment on human time scales, but far too short for it to exist as a primordial isotope today. Instead, iodine-129 is an extinct radionuclide, and its presence in the early solar system is inferred from the observation of an excess of its daughter xenon-129. This nuclide is also newly made by cosmic rays and as a byproduct of human nuclear fission, which it is used to monitor as a very long-lived environmental contaminant.</p>\n<p>The next-longest-lived radioisotope, iodine-125, has a half-life of 59 days. It is used as a convenient gamma-emitting tag for proteins in biological assays, and a few nuclear medicine imaging tests where a longer half-life is required. It is also commonly used in brachytherapy implanted capsules, which kill tumors by local short-range gamma radiation (but where the isotope is never released into the body).</p>\n<p>Iodine-123 (half-life 13 hours) is the isotope of choice for nuclear medicine imaging of the thyroid gland, which naturally accumulates all iodine isotopes.</p>\n<p>Iodine-131 (half-life 8 days) is a beta-emitting isotope, which is a common nuclear fission product. It is preferably administered to humans only in very high doses which destroy all tissues that accumulate it (usually the thyroid), which in turn prevents these tissues from developing cancer from a lower dose (paradoxically, a high dose of this isotope appears safer for the thyroid than a low dose). Like other radioiodines, I-131 accumulates in the thyroid gland, but unlike the others, in small amounts it is highly carcinogenic there, it seems, owing to the high local cell mutation due to damage from beta decay. Because of this tendency of I to cause high damage to cells that accumulate it and other cells near them (0.6 to 2&nbsp;mm away, the range of the beta rays), it is the only iodine radioisotope used as direct therapy, to kill tissues such as cancers that take up artificially iodinated molecules (example, the compound iobenguane, also known as MIBG). For the same reason, only the iodine isotope I-131 is used to treat Grave's disease and those types of thyroid cancers (sometimes in metastatic form) where the tissue that requires destruction, still functions to naturally accumulate iodide.</p>\n<p>Nonradioactive ordinary potassium iodide (iodine-127), in a number of convenient forms (tablets or solution) may be used to saturate the thyroid gland's ability to take up further iodine, and thus protect against accidental contamination from iodine-131 generated by nuclear fission accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster and more recently the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, as well as from contamination from this isotope in nuclear fallout from nuclear weapons.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nIodomethane</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Iodine is rare in the solar system and Earth's crust (47–60th in abundance); however, iodide salts are often very soluble in water. Iodine occurs in slightly greater concentrations in seawater than in rocks, 0.05 vs. 0.04 ppm. Minerals containing iodine include caliche, found in Chile. The brown algae <i>Laminaria</i> and <i>Fucus</i> found in temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere contain 0.028–0.454 dry weight percent of iodine. Aside from tungsten, iodine is the heaviest element to be essential in living organisms. About 19,000 tonnes are produced annually from natural sources.</p>\n<p>Organoiodine compounds are produced by marine life forms, the most notable being iodomethane (commonly called methyl iodide). About 214 kilotonnes/year of iodomethane is produced by the marine environment, by microbial activity in rice paddies and by the burning of biological material. The volatile iodomethane is broken up in the atmosphere as part of a global iodine cycle.</p>\n<h2>Chemistry</h2>\n<p>Iodine adopts a variety of oxidation states, commonly ranging from (formally) I(VII) to I(-I), and including the intermediate states of I(V), I(III) and I(I). Practically, only the -1 oxidation state is of significance, being the form found in iodide salts and organoiodine compounds. Iodine is a Lewis acid. With electron donors such as triphenylphosphine and pyridine it forms a charge-transfer complex. With the iodide anion it forms the triiodide ion. Iodine and the iodide ion form a redox couple. I is easily reduced and I is easily oxidized.</p>\n<h3>Redox reactions</h3>\n<p>In everyday life, iodides are slowly oxidized by atmospheric oxygen in the atmosphere to give free iodine. Evidence for this conversion is the yellow tint of certain aged samples of iodide salts and some organoiodine compounds. The oxidation of iodide to iodine in air is also responsible for the slow loss of iodide content in iodized salt if exposed to air. Some salts use iodate to prevent the loss of iodine.</p>\n<p>Iodine is easily reduced. Most common is the interconversion of I and I. Molecular iodine can be prepared by oxidizing iodides with chlorine:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 I + Cl → I + 2 Cl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>or with manganese dioxide in acid solution:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 I + 4 H + MnO → I + 2 HO + Mn</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Iodine is reduced to hydroiodic acid by hydrogen sulfide and hydrazine:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>8 I + 8 HS → 16 HI + S</dd>\n<dd>2 I + NH → 4 HI + N</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>When dissolved in fuming sulfuric acid (65% oleum), iodine forms an intense blue solution. The blue color is due to I+\n2 cation, the result of iodine being oxidized by SO\n3:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 I\n2 + 2 SO\n3 + H\n2SO\n4 → 2 I+\n2 + SO\n2 + 2 HSO−\n4</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The I+\n2 cation is also formed in the oxidation of iodine by SbF\n5 or TaF\n5. The resulting I+\n2Sb\n2F−\n11 or I+\n2Ta\n2F−\n11 can be isolated as deep blue crystals. The solutions of these salts turn red when cooled below −60°C, owing to the formation of the I2+\n4 cation:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 I+\n2  I2+\n4</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Under slightly more alkaline conditions, I2+\n4 disproportionates into I+\n3 and an iodine(III) compound. Excess iodine can then react with I+\n3 to form I+\n5 (green) and I3+\n15 (black).</p>\n<h3>Oxides</h3>\n<div>See also: Iodine oxide</div>\n<p>The best-known oxides are the anions, IO−\n3 and IO−\n4, but several other oxides are known, such as the strong oxidant iodine pentoxide.</p>\n<p>By contrast with chlorine, the formation of the hypohalite ion (IO) in neutral aqueous solutions of iodine is negligible.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>I + HO  H + I + HIO &nbsp; (<i>K</i> = 2.0×10) In basic solutions (such as aqueous sodium hydroxide), iodine converts in a two stage reaction to iodide and iodate:</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Organic derivatives of hypoiodate (2-Iodoxybenzoic acid, and Dess-Martin periodinane) are used in organic chemistry.</p>\n<p>Iodic acid (HIO), periodic acid (HIO) and their salts are strong oxidizers and are of some use in organic synthesis. Iodine is oxidized to iodate by nitric acid as well as by chlorates:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>I + 10 HNO → 2 HIO + 10 NO + 4 HO</dd>\n<dd>I + 2 ClO−\n3 → 2 IO−\n3 + Cl</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Other inorganic compounds</h3>\n<div>See also: Category: Iodine compounds</div>\n<p>Iodine forms compounds with all the elements except for the noble gases. From the perspective of commercial applications, an important compound is hydroiodic acid, used as a co-catalyst in the Cativa process for the production of acetic acid. Titanium and aluminium iodides are used in the production of butadiene, a precursor to rubber tires.</p>\n<p>Alkali metal salts are common colourless solids that are highly soluble in water. Potassium iodide is a convenient source of the iodide anion; it is easier to handle than sodium iodide because it is not hygroscopic. Both salts are mainly used in the production of iodized salt. Sodium iodide is especially useful in the Finkelstein reaction, because it is soluble in acetone, whereas potassium iodide is less so. In this reaction, an alkyl chloride is converted to an alkyl iodide. This relies on the insolubility of sodium chloride in acetone to drive the reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>R-Cl <small>(acetone)</small> + NaI <small>(acetone)</small> → R-I <small>(acetone)</small> + NaCl <small>(s)</small></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Despite having the lowest electronegativity of the common halogens, iodine reacts violently with some metals, such as aluminium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 I + 2 Al → 2 AlI</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction produces 314 kJ per mole of aluminium, comparable to thermite's 425 kJ. Yet the reaction initiates spontaneously, and if unconfined, causes a cloud of gaseous iodine due to the high temperature.</p>\n<p>Interhalogen compounds are well known; examples include iodine monochloride and trichloride; iodine pentafluoride and heptafluoride.</p>\n<h3>Organic compounds</h3>\n<div>See also: Organoiodine compound</div>\n<p>Organoiodine compounds can be made in many ways. For example, methyl iodide can be prepared from methanol, red phosphorus, and iodine. The iodinating reagent is phosphorus triiodide that is formed <i>in situ</i>:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 CHOH + PI → 3 CHI + HPO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The simplest organoiodine compound is iodomethane, approved as a soil fumigant. The iodoform test uses an alkaline solution of iodine to react with methyl ketones to give the labile triiodomethide leaving group, forming iodoform, which precipitates. Aryl and alkyl iodides both form Grignard reagents. Iodine is sometimes used to activate magnesium when preparing Grignard reagents. Alkyl iodides such as iodomethane are good alkylating agents.</p>\n<p>Some drawbacks to the use of organoiodine compounds in chemical synthesis are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iodine compounds are more expensive than the corresponding bromides and chlorides, in that order</li>\n<li>iodides are much stronger alkylating agents, and so are more toxic (e.g., methyl iodide is very toxic (T+).</li>\n<li>low-molecular-weight iodides tend to have a much higher equivalent weight, compared to other alkylating agents (e.g., methyl iodide versus dimethyl carbonate), owing to the atomic mass of iodine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Of the several places in which iodine occurs in nature, only two sources are useful commercially: the caliche, found in Chile, and the iodine-containing brines of gas and oil fields, especially in Japan and the United States. The caliche contains sodium nitrate, which is the main product of the mining activities, and small amounts of sodium iodate and sodium iodide. In the extraction of sodium nitrate, the sodium iodate and sodium iodide are extracted. The high concentration of iodine in the caliche and the extensive mining made Chile the largest producer of iodine in 2007.</p>\n<p>Most other producers use natural occurring brine for the production of iodine. The Japanese Minami Kanto gas field east of Tokyo and the American Anadarko Basin gas field in northwest Oklahoma are the two largest sources for iodine from brine. The brine has a temperature of over 60°C owing to the depth of the source. The brine is first purified and acidified using sulfuric acid, then the iodide present is oxidized to iodine with chlorine. An iodine solution is produced, but is dilute and must be concentrated. Air is blown into the solution, causing the iodine to evaporate, then it is passed into an absorbing tower containing acid where sulfur dioxide is added to reduce the iodine. The hydrogen iodide (HI) is reacted with chlorine to precipitate the iodine. After filtering and purification the iodine is packed.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 HI + Cl → I↑ + 2 HCl</dd>\n<dd>I + 2 HO + SO → 2 HI + HSO</dd>\n<dd>2 HI + Cl → I↓ + 2 HCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The production of iodine from seawater via electrolysis is not used owing to the sufficient abundance of iodine-rich brine. Another source of iodine is kelp, used in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it is no longer economically viable.</p>\n<p>Commercial samples often contain high concentrations of impurities, which can be removed by sublimation. The element may also be prepared in an ultra-pure form through the reaction of potassium iodide with copper(II) sulfate, which gives copper(II) iodide initially. That decomposes spontaneously to copper(I) iodide and iodine:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Cu + 2 I → CuI</dd>\n<dd>2 CuI → 2 CuI + I</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>There are also other methods of isolating this element in the laboratory, for example, the method used to isolate other halogens: oxidation of the iodide in hydrogen iodide (often made <i>in situ</i> with an iodide and sulfuric acid) by manganese dioxide (see below in <i>Descriptive chemistry</i>).</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Iodine was discovered by French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811. He was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (a vital part of gunpowder). At the time of the Napoleonic Wars, France was at war and saltpeter was in great demand. Saltpeter produced from French niter beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapor rose. He noted that the vapor crystallized on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.</p>\n<p>Courtois gave samples to his friends, Charles Bernard Desormes (1777–1862) and Nicolas Clément (1779–1841), to continue research. He also gave some of the substance to chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778–1850), and to physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836). On 29 November 1813, Dersormes and Clément made public Courtois's discovery. They described the substance to a meeting of the Imperial Institute of France. On December 6, Gay-Lussac announced that the new substance was either an element or a compound of oxygen. It was Gay-Lussac who suggested the name <i>\"iode\"</i>, from the Greek word ιώδες (iodes) for violet (because of the color of iodine vapor). Ampère had given some of his sample to Humphry Davy (1778–1829). Davy did some experiments on the substance and noted its similarity to chlorine. Davy sent a letter dated December 10 to the Royal Society of London stating that he had identified a new element. Arguments erupted between Davy and Gay-Lussac over who identified iodine first, but both scientists acknowledged Courtois as the first to isolate the element.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>The production of ethylenediammonium diiodide, provided as a nutritional supplement for livestock, consumes a large fraction of available iodine. Another significant use is as a co-catalyst for the production of acetic acid by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. In these technologies, which support the world's demand for acetic acid, hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes carbonylation. Hydrolysis of the resulting acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives acetic acid.</p>\n<h3>Disinfectants</h3>\n<p>Elemental iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms. The iodine exists as the element, or as the water-soluble triiodide anion I generated <i>in situ</i> by adding iodide to poorly water-soluble elemental iodine (the reverse chemical reaction makes some free elemental iodine available for antisepsis). In alternative fashion, iodine may come from iodophors, which contain iodine complexed with a solubilizing agent (iodide ion may be thought of loosely as the iodophor in triiodide water solutions). Examples of such preparations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tincture of iodine: iodine in ethanol, or iodine and sodium iodide in a mixture of ethanol and water.</li>\n<li>Lugol's iodine: iodine and iodide in water alone, forming mostly triiodide. Unlike tincture of iodine, Lugol's has a minimized amount of the free iodine (I) component.</li>\n<li>Povidone iodine (an iodophor).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Analysis</h3>\n<div>See also: Staining</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTesting a seed for starch with a solution of iodine</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Iodine is useful in analytical chemistry because of its reactions with alkenes, starch and oxidizing and reducing agents. The highly colored species involved in these reactions make it easy to detect the endpoints in many analytical determinations. Iodine is a common general stain used in thin-layer chromatography. Iodine forms an intense blue complex with the glucose polymers starch and glycogen. Several analytical methods rely on this property:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iodometry. The concentration of an oxidant can be determined by adding it to an excess of iodide, to destroy elemental iodine/triiodide as a result of oxidation by the oxidant. A starch indicator is then used as the indicator close to the end-point, in order to increase the visual contrast (dark blue becomes colorless, instead of the yellow of dilute triiodide becoming colorless).</li>\n<li>An Iodine test may be used to test a sample substance for the presence of starch. The Iodine clock reaction is an extension of the techniques in iodometry.</li>\n<li>Iodine solutions are used in counterfeit banknote detection pens; the premise being that counterfeit banknotes made using commercially available paper contain starch.</li>\n<li>Starch-iodide paper are used to test for the presence of oxidants such as peroxides. The oxidants convert iodide to iodine, which shows up as blue. A solution of starch and iodide can perform the same function.</li>\n<li>During colposcopy, Lugol's iodine is applied to the vagina and cervix. Normal vaginal tissue stains brown owing to its high glycogen content (a color-reaction similar to that with starch), while abnormal tissue suspicious for cancer does not stain, and thus appears pale compared to the surrounding tissue. Biopsy of suspicious tissue can then be performed. This is called a Schiller's Test.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Iodine value or iodine number is used to indicate the number of carbon-carbon double bonds in vegetable oils and fatty acids.</p>\n<h3>Medical applications</h3>\n<p>Potassium iodide has been used as an expectorant, although this use is increasingly uncommon. In medicine, potassium iodide is usually used to treat acute thyrotoxicosis, usually as a saturated solution of potassium iodide called <b>SSKI</b>. It is also used to block uptake of iodine-131 in the thyroid gland (see isotopes section above), when this isotope is used as part of radiopharmaceuticals (such as iobenguane) that are not targeted to the thyroid or thyroid-type tissues.</p>\n<p>Iodine-131 (usually in the chemical form of iodide) is a component of nuclear fallout and a particularly dangerous one owing to the thyroid gland's propensity to concentrate ingested iodine, where it is kept for periods longer than this isotope's radiological half-life of eight days. For this reason, if people are expected to be exposed to a significant amount of environmental radioactive iodine (iodine-131 in fallout), they may be instructed to take non-radioactive potassium iodide tablets. The typical adult dose is one 130&nbsp;mg tablet per 24 hours, supplying 100&nbsp;mg (100,000 micrograms) iodine, as iodide ion. (Typical daily dose of iodine to maintain normal health is of order 100 micrograms; see \"Dietary Intake\" below.) By ingesting this large amount of non-radioactive iodine, radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid gland is minimized. See the article on potassium iodide for more on this topic.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDiatrizoic acid, an iodine-containing radiocontrast agent</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Iodine, as an element with high electron density and atomic number, absorbs X-rays well. Therefore, it may be used as a radiocontrast agent by filtering out imaging X-rays weaker than 33.3 keV, where iodine's innermost electrons begin absorbing X-rays strongly due to the photoelectric effect. Organic compounds of a certain type (typically iodine-substituted benzene derivatives) are thus used in medicine as X-ray radiocontrast agents for intravenous injection. This is often in conjunction with advanced X-ray techniques such as angiography and CT scanning. At present, all water-soluble radiocontrast agents rely on iodine.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>Inorganic iodides find specialized uses. Hafnium, zirconium, titanium are purified by the van Arkel Process, which involves the reversible formation of the tetraiodides of these elements. Silver iodide is a major ingredient to traditional photographic film. Thousands of kilograms of silver iodide are consumed annually for cloud seeding.</p>\n<p>The organoiodine compound erythrosine is an important food coloring agent. Perfluoroalkyl iodides are precursors to important surfactants, such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid.</p>\n<p>Iodine was also used by the police, especially forensics, Iodine fuming was an effective way of revealing latent fingerprints on paper and other similar surfaces. It is still used mildly today.</p>\n<p>In the United States, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regards iodine and compounds containing iodine (ionic iodides, iodoform, ethyl iodide, and so on) as reagents useful for the clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<div>Main article: Iodine in biology</div>\n<p>Iodine is an essential trace element for life, the heaviest element commonly needed by living organisms. Only tungsten, a component of a few bacterial enzymes, has a higher atomic number and atomic weight.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThyroxines are iodine-containing hormones that justify the widespread use of iodised salt.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Iodine's main role in animal biology is as a constituent of the thyroid hormones <i>thyroxine</i> (T4) and <i>triiodothyronine</i> (T3). These are made from addition condensation products of the amino acid tyrosine, and are stored prior to release in an iodine-containing protein called thyroglobulin. T4 and T3 contain four and three atoms of iodine per molecule, respectively. The thyroid gland actively absorbs iodide from the blood to make and release these hormones into the blood, actions that are regulated by a second hormone TSH from the pituitary. Thyroid hormones are phylogenetically very old molecules that are synthesized by most multicellular organisms, and that even have some effect on unicellular organisms.</p>\n<p>Thyroid hormones play a basic role in biology, acting on gene transcription to regulate the basal metabolic rate. The total deficiency of thyroid hormones can reduce basal metabolic rate up to 50%, while in excessive production of thyroid hormones the basal metabolic rate can be increased by 100%. T4 acts largely as a precursor to T3, which is (with minor exceptions) the biologically active hormone. In amphibian metamorphosis iodine and thyroid hormones exert a well-studied experimental model of apoptosis on the cells of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles.</p>\n<p>Iodine has a nutritional relationship with selenium. A family of selenium-dependent enzymes called deiodinases converts T4 to T3 (the active hormone) by removing an iodine atom from the outer tyrosine ring. These enzymes also convert T4 to reverse T3 (rT3) by removing an inner ring iodine atom, and convert T3 to 3,3'-diiodothyronine (T2) also by removing an inner ring atom. Both of the latter are inactivated hormones that are ready for disposal and have, in essence, no biological effects. A family of non-selenium-dependent enzymes then further deiodinates the products of these reactions.</p>\n<p>Iodine accounts for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of the T3. Fifteen to 20&nbsp;mg of iodine is concentrated in thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of the body's iodine is distributed in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of these tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). Its role in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but its role in the other tissues is unknown.</p>\n<h3>Dietary intake</h3>\n<p>The daily Dietary Reference Intake recommended by the United States Institute of Medicine is between 110 and 130 µg for infants up to 12 months, 90&nbsp;µg for children up to eight years, 130&nbsp;µg for children up to 13 years, 150&nbsp;µg for adults, 220&nbsp;µg for pregnant women and 290&nbsp;µg for lactating mothers. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults is 1,100&nbsp;μg/day (1.1&nbsp;mg/day). The tolerable upper limit was assessed by analyzing the effect of supplementation on thyroid-stimulating hormone.</p>\n<p>The thyroid gland needs no more than 70 &nbsp;μg/day to synthesize the requisite daily amounts of T4 and T3. The higher recommended daily allowance levels of iodine seem necessary for optimal function of a number of body systems, including lactating breast, gastric mucosa, salivary glands, oral mucosa, arterial walls</p>\n<p>Natural sources of iodine include sea life, such as kelp and certain seafood, as well as plants grown on iodine-rich soil. Iodized salt is fortified with iodine.</p>\n<p>As of 2000, the median intake of iodine from food in the United States was 240 to 300&nbsp;μg/day for men and 190 to 210&nbsp;μg/day for women. In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280 μg/day to 13,800 μg/day, this owing to the frequent consumption of seaweed or kombu kelp. However, new studies suggest that Japan's consumption is closer to 1,000-3,000&nbsp;μg/day.</p>\n<p>After iodine fortification programs (e.g., iodized salt) have been implemented, some cases of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism have been observed (so-called Jod-Basedow phenomenon). The condition seems to occur mainly in people over forty, and the risk appears higher when iodine deficiency is severe and the initial rise in iodine intake is high.</p>\n<p>Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.</p>\n<h3>Deficiency</h3>\n<div>Main articles: Iodine deficiency and iodized salt</div>\n<p>In an estimated two-thirds of households on Earth, table salt is iodized. However, this still leaves an estimated two billion people iodine-deficient. Iodine is required for the essential thyroxin hormones produced by and concentrated in the thyroid gland.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDisability-adjusted life year for iodine deficiency per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2002.\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;no data</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;less than 50</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;50-100</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;100-150</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;150-200</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;200-250</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;250-300</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;300-350</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;350-400</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;400-450</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;450-500</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;500-800</div>\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;more than 800</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In areas where there is little iodine in the diet, typically remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency is the leading cause of preventable mental retardation, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but, as of March 2006, iodine deficiency remained a serious public health problem in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe.</p>\n<p>Other possible health effects being investigated as being related to deficiency include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Breast cancer.</b> The breast strongly and actively concentrates iodine into breast-milk for the benefit of the developing infant, and may develop a goiter-like hyperplasia, sometimes manifesting as fibrocystic breast disease, when iodine levels are low.</li>\n<li><b>Stomach cancer</b>. Some researchers have found an epidemiologic correlation between iodine deficiency, iodine-deficient goitre and gastric cancer. A decrease of the incidence of death rate from stomach cancer after implementation of the effective iodine-prophylaxis has been reported also.</li>\n<li><b>Autism</b> Although there isn't a definitive answer for the cause of autism in children, research has shown that mothers with low levels of iodine are more likely to have an autistic child.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Toxicity</h3>\n<p>Elemental iodine (I) is toxic if taken orally. The lethal dose for an adult human is 30&nbsp;mg/kg, which is about 2.1-2.4&nbsp;grams (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000&nbsp;mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic in the presence of selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. Its toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, which make it able to denaturate proteins (including enzymes).</p>\n<p>Elemental iodine is also a skin irritant, and direct contact with skin can cause damage, so iodine crystals should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution are capable of causing tissue damage if their use for cleaning and antisepsis is prolonged; similarly, cases have been reported where liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns.</p>\n<h3>Allergic reactions</h3>\n<p>Some people develop a hypersensitivity to iodine-containing products and foods. Applications of tincture of iodine or Betadine can cause rashes, sometimes severe. Parenteral use of iodine-based contrast agents (see above) can cause reactions ranging from a mild rash to fatal anaphylaxis. Such reactions have led to the misconception (widely held, even among physicians) that some people are allergic to iodine itself; even allergies to iodine-rich seafood have been so construed. In fact, there has never been a confirmed report of a true iodine allergy, and an allergy to elemental iodine or simple iodide salts is theoretically impossible. Hypersensitivity reactions to iodine-containing products and foods are apparently related to their other molecular components; thus, a person who has demonstrated an allergy to one iodine-containing food or product should not be assumed to have an allergy to another one. Still, as with all medications, the potential severity of reactions to medical iodine-containing products should prompt questions about a patient's allergy history before they are administered.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Chemical oxygen iodine laser</li>\n<li>Inadine</li>\n<li>Iodide as an antioxidant</li>\n<li>Nutrition facts label</li>\n<li>Starch indicator</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^ Online Etymology Dictionary, s.v. iodine.

  "title": "Xenon",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Xenon (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Xenon</b> is a chemical element with the symbol&nbsp;<b>Xe</b> and atomic number&nbsp;54. It is a colorless, heavy, odorless noble gas, that occurs in the Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts. Although generally unreactive, xenon can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate, the first noble gas compound to be synthesized.</p>\n<p>Naturally occurring xenon consists of eight stable isotopes. There are also over 40 unstable isotopes that undergo radioactive decay. The isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the Solar System. Radioactive xenon-135 is produced from iodine-135 as a result of nuclear fission, and it acts as the most significant neutron absorber in nuclear reactors.</p>\n<p>Xenon is used in flash lamps and arc lamps, and as a general anesthetic. The first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule (Xe) as its lasing medium, and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps. Xenon is also being used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles and as the propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Xenon was discovered in England by the Scottish chemist William Ramsay and English chemist Morris Travers on July 12, 1898, shortly after their discovery of the elements krypton and neon. They found xenon in the residue left over from evaporating components of liquid air. Ramsay suggested the name <i>xenon</i> for this gas from the Greek word <i>ξένον</i> [xenon], neuter singular form of <i>ξένος</i> [xenos], meaning 'foreign(er)', 'strange(r)', or 'guest'. In 1902, Ramsay estimated the proportion of xenon in the Earth's atmosphere as one part in 20 million. The current symbol for Xenon is <b>Xe</b>, however historically it was also written as <b>X</b>.</p>\n<p>During the 1930s, American engineer Harold Edgerton began exploring strobe light technology for high speed photography. This led him to the invention of the xenon flash lamp, in which light is generated by sending a brief electrical current through a tube filled with xenon gas. In 1934, Edgerton was able to generate flashes as brief as one microsecond with this method.</p>\n<p>In 1939, American physician Albert R. Behnke Jr. began exploring the causes of \"drunkenness\" in deep-sea divers. He tested the effects of varying the breathing mixtures on his subjects, and discovered that this caused the divers to perceive a change in depth. From his results, he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an anesthetic. Although Russian toxicologist Nikolay V. Lazarev apparently studied xenon anesthesia in 1941, the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in 1946 by American medical researcher John H. Lawrence, who experimented on mice. Xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in 1951 by American anesthesiologist Stuart C. Cullen, who successfully operated on two patients.</p>\n<p>Xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form compounds. However, while teaching at the University of British Columbia, Neil Bartlett discovered that the gas platinum hexafluoride (PtF) was a powerful oxidizing agent that could oxidize oxygen gas (O) to form dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate (O[PtF]). Since O and xenon have almost the same first ionization potential, Bartlett realized that platinum hexafluoride might also be able to oxidize xenon. On March 23, 1962, he mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound of a noble gas, xenon hexafluoroplatinate. Bartlett thought its composition to be Xe[PtF], although later work has revealed that it was probably a mixture of various xenon-containing salts. Since then, many other xenon compounds have been discovered, along with some compounds of the noble gases argon, krypton, and radon, including argon fluorohydride (HArF), krypton difluoride (KrF), and radon fluoride. By 1971, more than 80 xenon compounds were known.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>Xenon flash<br>\n(animated version)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Xenon has atomic number 54; that is, its nucleus contains 54 protons. At standard temperature and pressure, pure xenon gas has a density of 5.761&nbsp;kg/m, about 4.5 times the surface density of the Earth's atmosphere, 1.217&nbsp;kg/m. As a liquid, xenon has a density of up to 3.100&nbsp;g/mL, with the density maximum occurring at the triple point. Under the same conditions, the density of solid xenon, 3.640&nbsp;g/cm, is higher than the average density of granite, 2.75&nbsp;g/cm. Using gigapascals of pressure, xenon has been forced into a metallic phase.</p>\n<p>Solid xenon changes from face-centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close packed (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140&nbsp;GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155&nbsp;GPa. When metalized, xenon looks sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small widths of the electron bands in metallic xenon.</p>\n<p>Xenon is a member of the zero-valence elements that are called noble or inert gases. It is inert to most common chemical reactions (such as combustion, for example) because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. However, xenon can be oxidized by powerful oxidizing agents, and many xenon compounds have been synthesized.</p>\n<p>In a gas-filled tube, xenon emits a blue or lavenderish glow when the gas is excited by electrical discharge. Xenon emits a band of emission lines that span the visual spectrum, but the most intense lines occur in the region of blue light, which produces the coloration.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<p>Xenon is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere, occurring at 87±1&nbsp;parts per billion (nL/L), or approximately 1 part per 11.5 million, and is also found in gases emitted from some mineral springs.</p>\n<p>Xenon is obtained commercially as a byproduct of the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional distillation in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional distillation steps, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either via adsorption onto silica gel or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon via distillation. Extraction of a liter of xenon from the atmosphere requires 220 watt-hours of energy. Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000&nbsp;m. Because of its low abundance, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10&nbsp;€/L for xenon, 1&nbsp;€/L for krypton, and 0.20&nbsp;€/L for neon; the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter.</p>\n<p>Within the Solar System, the nucleon fraction of xenon is 1.56 × 10, for an abundance of approximately one part in 630&nbsp;thousand of the total mass. Xenon is relatively rare in the Sun's atmosphere, on Earth, and in asteroids and comets. The planet Jupiter has an unusually high abundance of xenon in its atmosphere; about 2.6 times as much as the Sun. This high abundance remains unexplained and may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals—small, subplanetary bodies—before the presolar disk began to heat up. (Otherwise, xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices.) The problem of the low terrestrial xenon may potentially be explained by covalent bonding of xenon to oxygen within quartz, hence reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Unlike the lower mass noble gases, the normal stellar nucleosynthesis process inside a star does not form xenon. Elements more massive than iron-56 have a net energy cost to produce through fusion, so there is no energy gain for a star when creating xenon. Instead, xenon is formed during supernova explosions, by the slow neutron capture process (s-process) of red giant stars that have exhausted the hydrogen at their cores and entered the asymptotic giant branch, in classical nova explosions and from the radioactive decay of elements such as iodine, uranium and plutonium.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes and isotopic studies</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of xenon</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring xenon is made of eight stable isotopes, the most of any element with the exception of tin, which has ten. Xenon and tin are the only elements to have more than seven stable isotopes. The isotopes Xe and Xe are predicted to undergo double beta decay, but this has never been observed so they are considered to be stable. Besides these stable forms, there are over 40 unstable isotopes that have been studied. The longest lived of these isotopes is Xe, which has been observed to undergo double beta decay with a half-life of 2.11 x 10yr. Xe is produced by beta decay of I, which has a half-life of 16&nbsp;million years, while Xe, Xe, Xe, and Xe are some of the fission products of both U and Pu, and therefore used as indicators of nuclear explosions.</p>\n<p>Nuclei of two of the stable isotopes of xenon, Xe and Xe, have non-zero intrinsic angular momenta (nuclear spins, suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance). The nuclear spins can be aligned beyond ordinary polarization levels by means of circularly polarized light and rubidium vapor. The resulting spin polarization of xenon nuclei can surpass 50% of its maximum possible value, greatly exceeding the equilibrium value dictated by the Boltzmann distribution (typically 0.001% of the maximum value at room temperature, even in the strongest magnets). Such non-equilibrium alignment of spins is a temporary condition, and is called <i>hyperpolarization</i>. The process of hyperpolarizing the xenon is called <i>optical pumping</i> (although the process is different from pumping a laser).</p>\n<p>Because a Xe nucleus has a spin of 1/2, and therefore a zero electric quadrupole moment, the Xe nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other atoms, and thus its hyperpolarization can be maintained for long periods of time even after the laser beam has been turned off and the alkali vapor removed by condensation on a room-temperature surface. Spin polarization of Xe can persist from several seconds for xenon atoms dissolved in blood to several hours in the gas phase and several days in deeply frozen solid xenon. In contrast, Xe has a nuclear spin value of 3/2 and a nonzero quadrupole moment, and has <i>T</i> relaxation times in the millisecond and second ranges.</p>\n<p>Some radioactive isotopes of xenon, for example, Xe and Xe, are produced by neutron irradiation of fissionable material within nuclear reactors. Xe is of considerable significance in the operation of nuclear fission reactors. Xe has a huge cross section for thermal neutrons, 2.6×10&nbsp;barns, so it acts as a neutron absorber or \"poison\" that can slow or stop the chain reaction after a period of operation. This was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the American Manhattan Project for plutonium production. Fortunately the designers had made provisions in the design to increase the reactor's reactivity (the number of neutrons per fission that go on to fission other atoms of nuclear fuel). Xe reactor poisoning played a major role in the Chernobyl disaster. A shutdown or decrease of power of a reactor can result in buildup of Xe and getting the reactor into the iodine pit.</p>\n<p>Under adverse conditions, relatively high concentrations of radioactive xenon isotopes may be found emanating from nuclear reactors due to the release of fission products from cracked fuel rods, or fissioning of uranium in cooling water.</p>\n<p>Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a powerful tool for studying the formation of the solar system. The iodine-xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. As the half-life of I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale, only 16 million years, this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, as the I isotope was likely generated before the Solar System was formed, but not long before, and seeded the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.</p>\n<p>In a similar way, xenon isotopic ratios such as Xe/Xe and Xe/Xe are also a powerful tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early outgassing. For example, The atmosphere of Mars shows a xenon abundance similar to that of Earth: 0.08&nbsp;parts per million, however Mars shows a higher proportion of Xe than the Earth or the Sun. As this isotope is generated by radioactive decay, the result may indicate that Mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere, possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed. In another example, excess Xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from New Mexico was believed to be from the decay of mantle-derived gases soon after Earth's formation.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Xenon compounds</div>\n<p>After Neil Bartlett's discovery in 1962 that xenon can form chemical compounds, a large number of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nXenon tetrafluoride</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nXeF crystals, 1962</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Three fluorides are known: XeF\n2, XeF\n4, and XeF\n6. XeF is theorized to be unstable. The fluorides are the starting point for the synthesis of almost all xenon compounds.</p>\n<p>The solid, crystalline difluoride XeF\n2 is formed when a mixture of fluorine and xenon gases is exposed to ultraviolet light. Ordinary daylight is sufficient. Long-term heating of XeF\n2 at high temperatures under an NiF\n2 catalyst yields XeF\n6. Pyrolysis of XeF\n6 in the presence of NaF yields high-purity XeF\n4.</p>\n<p>The xenon fluorides behave as both fluoride acceptors and fluoride donors, forming salts that contain such cations as XeF+ and Xe\n2F+\n3, and anions such as XeF−\n5, XeF−\n7, and XeF2−\n8. The green, paramagnetic Xe+\n2 is formed by the reduction of XeF\n2 by xenon gas.</p>\n<p>XeF\n2 is also able to form coordination complexes with transition metal ions. Over 30 such complexes have been synthesized and characterized.</p>\n<p>Whereas the xenon fluorides are well-characterized, the other halides are not known, the only exception being the dichloride, XeCl. Xenon dichloride is reported to be an endothermic, colorless, crystalline compound that decomposes into the elements at 80°C, formed by the high-frequency irradiation of a mixture of xenon, fluorine, and silicon or carbon tetrachloride. However, doubt has been raised as to whether XeCl\n2 is a real compound and not merely a van der Waals molecule consisting of weakly bound Xe atoms and Cl\n2 molecules. Theoretical calculations indicate that the linear molecule XeCl\n2 is less stable than the van der Waals complex.</p>\n<h3>Oxides and oxohalides</h3>\n<p>Three oxides of xenon are known: xenon trioxide (XeO\n3) and xenon tetroxide (XeO\n4), both of which are dangerously explosive and powerful oxidizing agents, and xenon dioxide (XeO), which was reported in 2011 with a coordination number of four. XeO forms when xenon tetrafluoride is poured over ice. Its crystal structure may allow it to replace silicon in silicate minerals. The XeOO cation has been identified by infrared spectroscopy in solid argon.</p>\n<p>Xenon does not react with oxygen directly; the trioxide is formed by the hydrolysis of XeF\n6:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>XeF\n6 + 3 H\n2O → XeO\n3 + 6 HF</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>XeO\n3 is weakly acidic, dissolving in alkali to form unstable <i>xenate</i> salts containing the HXeO−\n4 anion. These unstable salts easily disproportionate into xenon gas and <i>perxenate</i> salts, containing the XeO4−\n6 anion.</p>\n<p>Barium perxenate, when treated with concentrated sulfuric acid, yields gaseous xenon tetroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Ba\n2XeO\n6 + 2 H\n2SO\n4 → 2 BaSO\n4 + 2 H\n2O + XeO\n4</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>To prevent decomposition, the xenon tetroxide thus formed is quickly cooled to form a pale-yellow solid. It explodes above −35.9&nbsp;°C into xenon and oxygen gas.</p>\n<p>A number of xenon oxyfluorides are known, including XeOF\n2, XeOF\n4, XeO\n2F\n2, and XeO\n3F\n2. XeOF\n2 is formed by the reaction of OF\n2 with xenon gas at low temperatures. It may also be obtained by the partial hydrolysis of XeF\n4. It disproportionates at −20&nbsp;°C into XeF\n2 and XeO\n2F\n2. XeOF\n4 is formed by the partial hydrolysis of XeF\n6, or the reaction of XeF\n6 with sodium perxenate, Na\n4XeO\n6. The latter reaction also produces a small amount of XeO\n3F\n2. XeOF\n4 reacts with CsF to form the XeOF−\n5 anion, while XeOF reacts with the alkali metal fluorides KF, RbF and CsF to form the XeOF−\n4 anion.</p>\n<h3>Other compounds</h3>\n<p>Recently, there has been an interest in xenon compounds where xenon is directly bonded to a less electronegative element than fluorine or oxygen, particularly carbon. Electron-withdrawing groups, such as groups with fluorine substitution, are necessary to stabilize these compounds. Numerous such compounds have been characterized, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C\n6F\n5–Xe+–N≡C–CH\n3, where CF is the pentafluorophenyl group.</li>\n<li>[C\n6F\n5]\n2Xe</li>\n<li>C\n6F\n5–Xe–X, where X is CN, F, or Cl.</li>\n<li>R–C≡C–Xe+, where R is C\n2F−\n5 or tert-butyl.</li>\n<li>C\n6F\n5–XeF+\n2</li>\n<li>(C\n6F\n5Xe)\n2Cl+</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other compounds containing xenon bonded to a less electronegative element include F–Xe–N(SO\n2F)\n2 and F–Xe–BF\n2. The latter is synthesized from dioxygenyl tetrafluoroborate, O\n2BF\n4, at −100&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<p>An unusual ion containing xenon is the tetraxenonogold(II) cation, AuXe2+\n4, which contains Xe–Au bonds. This ion occurs in the compound AuXe\n4(Sb\n2F\n11)\n2, and is remarkable in having direct chemical bonds between two notoriously unreactive atoms, xenon and gold, with xenon acting as a transition metal ligand.</p>\n<p>The compound Xe\n2Sb\n2F\n11 contains a Xe–Xe bond, the longest element-element bond known (308.71 pm = 3.0871 Å).</p>\n<p>In 1995, M. Räsänen and co-workers, scientists at the University of Helsinki in Finland, announced the preparation of xenon dihydride (HXeH), and later xenon hydride-hydroxide (HXeOH), hydroxenoacetylene (HXeCCH), and other Xe-containing molecules. In 2008, Khriachtchev <i>et al.</i> reported the preparation of HXeOXeH by the photolysis of water within a cryogenic xenon matrix. Deuterated molecules, HXeOD and DXeOH, have also been produced.</p>\n<h3>Clathrates and excimers</h3>\n<p>In addition to compounds where xenon forms a chemical bond, xenon can form clathrates—substances where xenon atoms are trapped by the crystalline lattice of another compound. An example is xenon hydrate (Xe•5.75 HO), where xenon atoms occupy vacancies in a lattice of water molecules. This clathrate has a melting point of 24&nbsp;°C. The deuterated version of this hydrate has also been produced. Such clathrate hydrates can occur naturally under conditions of high pressure, such as in Lake Vostok underneath the Antarctic ice sheet. Clathrate formation can be used to fractionally distill xenon, argon and krypton.</p>\n<p>Xenon can also form endohedral fullerene compounds, where a xenon atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. The xenon atom trapped in the fullerene can be monitored via Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Using this technique, chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed, due to the sensitivity of the chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment. However, the xenon atom also has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene.</p>\n<p>While xenon atoms are at their ground energy state, they repel each other and will not form a bond. When xenon atoms becomes energized, however, they can form an excimer (excited dimer) until the electrons return to the ground state. This entity is formed because the xenon atom tends to fill its outermost electronic shell, and can briefly do this by adding an electron from a neighboring xenon atom. The typical lifetime of a xenon excimer is 1–5&nbsp;ns, and the decay releases photons with wavelengths of about 150 and 173&nbsp;nm. Xenon can also form excimers with other elements, such as the halogens bromine, chlorine and fluorine.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Although xenon is rare and relatively expensive to extract from Earth's atmosphere, it has a number of applications.</p>\n<h3>Illumination and optics</h3>\n<h4>Gas-discharge lamps</h4>\n<p>Xenon is used in light-emitting devices called xenon flash lamps, which are used in photographic flashes and stroboscopic lamps; to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light; and, occasionally, in bactericidal lamps. The first solid-state laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a xenon flash lamp, and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nXenon short-arc lamp</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSpace Shuttle Atlantis bathed in xenon lights</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nXenon gas discharge tube</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Continuous, short-arc, high pressure xenon arc lamps have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight and are used in solar simulators. That is, the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated black body radiator that has a temperature close to that observed from the Sun. After they were first introduced during the 1940s, these lamps began replacing the shorter-lived carbon arc lamps in movie projectors. They are employed in typical 35mm, IMAX and the new digital projectors film projection systems, automotive HID headlights, high-end \"tactical\" flashlights and other specialized uses. These arc lamps are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and they have intense emissions in the near infrared, which is used in some night vision systems.</p>\n<p>The individual cells in a plasma display use a mixture of xenon and neon that is converted into a plasma using electrodes. The interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet photons, which then excite the phosphor coating on the front of the display.</p>\n<p>Xenon is used as a \"starter gas\" in high pressure sodium lamps. It has the lowest thermal conductivity and lowest ionization potential of all the non-radioactive noble gases. As a noble gas, it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp. The low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state, and the low ionization potential causes the breakdown voltage of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state, which allows the lamp to be more easily started.</p>\n<h4>Lasers</h4>\n<p>In 1962, a group of researchers at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon, and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium. The first excimer laser used a xenon dimer (Xe) energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm. Xenon chloride and xenon fluoride have also been used in excimer (or, more accurately, exciplex) lasers. The xenon chloride excimer laser has been employed, for example, in certain dermatological uses.</p>\n<h3>Medical</h3>\n<h4>Anesthesia</h4>\n<p>Xenon has been used as a general anesthetic. Although it is expensive, anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are about to appear on the European market, because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically viable.</p>\n<p>Xenon interacts with many different receptors and ion channels and like many theoretically multi-modal inhalation anesthetics these interactions are likely complementary. Xenon is a high-affinity glycine-site NMDA receptor antagonist. However, xenon distinguishes itself from other clinically used NMDA receptor antagonists in its lack of neurotoxicity and its ability to inhibit the neurotoxicity of ketamine and nitrous oxide. Unlike ketamine and nitrous oxide, xenon does not stimulate a dopamine efflux from the nucleus accumbens. Like nitrous oxide and cyclopropane xenon activates the two-pore domain potassium channel TREK-1. A related channel TASK-3 also implicated in anesthetic actions is insensitive to xenon. Xenon inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine alpha4beta2 receptors which contribute to spinally mediated analgesia. Xenon is an effective inhibitor of plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase. Xenon inhibits Ca+ ATPase by binding to a hydrophobic pore within the enzyme and preventing the enzyme from assuming active conformations.</p>\n<p>Xenon is a competitive inhibitor of serotonin 5HT3. While neither anesthetic nor antinociceptive this activity reduces anesthesia-emergent nausea and vomiting.</p>\n<p>Xenon has a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than NO as an anesthetic. Thus it can be used in concentrations with oxygen that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (NO), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and so it is also viewed as environmentally friendly. Xenon vented into the atmosphere is being returned to its original source, so no environmental impact is likely.</p>\n<h4>Neuroprotectant</h4>\n<p>Xenon induces robust cardioprotection and neuroprotection through a variety of mechanisms of action. Through its influence on Ca2+, K+, KATP\\HIF and NMDA antagonism xenon is neuroprotective when administered before during &amp; after ischemic insults. Xenon is a high affinity antagonist at the NMDA receptor glycine site. Xenon is cardioprotective in ischemia-reperfusion conditions by inducing pharmacologic non-ischemic preconditioning. Xenon is cardioprotective by activating PKC-epsilon &amp; downstream p38-MAPK. Xenon mimics neuronal ischemic preconditioning by activating ATP sensitive potassium channels. Xenon allosterically reduces ATP mediated channel activation inhibition independently of the sulfonylurea receptor1 subunit, increasing KATP open-channel time and frequency. Xenon upregulates hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1a).</p>\n<p>Xenon gas was added as an ingredient of the ventilation mix for a newborn baby at St. Michael's Hospital, Bristol, England, whose life chances were otherwise very compromised, and was successful, leading to the authorisation of clinical trials for similar cases. The treatment is done simultaneously with cooling the body temperature to 33.5 °C.</p>\n<h4>Imaging</h4>\n<p>Gamma emission from the radioisotope Xe of xenon can be used to image the heart, lungs, and brain, for example, by means of single photon emission computed tomography. Xe has also been used to measure blood flow.</p>\n<p>Xenon, particularly hyperpolarized Xe, is a useful contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the gas phase, it can be used to image empty space such as cavities in a porous sample or alveoli in lungs. Hyperpolarization renders Xe much more detectable via magnetic resonance imaging and has been used for studies of the lungs and other tissues. It can be used, for example, to trace the flow of gases within the lungs. Because xenon is soluble in water and also in hydrophobic solvents, it can be used to image various soft living tissues.</p>\n<p>Xenon with its high nuclear mass is (not more than 35&nbsp;% as it would act as an narcotic) - supplemented by Krypton - contrast medium for x-ray photography.</p>\n<h3>NMR spectroscopy</h3>\n<p>Because of the atom's large, flexible outer electron shell, the NMR spectrum changes in response to surrounding conditions, and can therefore be used as a probe to measure the chemical circumstances around the xenon atom. For instance xenon dissolved in water, xenon dissolved in hydrophobic solvent, and xenon associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by NMR.</p>\n<p>Hyperpolarized xenon can be used by surface-chemists. Normally, it is difficult to characterize surfaces using NMR, because signals from the surface of a sample will be overwhelmed by signals from the far-more-numerous atomic nuclei in the bulk. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized, by transferrering spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized xenon gas. This makes the surface signals strong enough to measure, and distinguishes them from bulk signals.</p>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<p>In nuclear energy applications, xenon is used in bubble chambers, probes, and in other areas where a high molecular weight and inert nature is desirable. A by-product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon-133 and xenon-135. The detection of these isotopes is used to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties, as well as to confirm nuclear test explosions by states such as North Korea.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA prototype of a xenon ion engine being tested at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Liquid xenon is being used in calorimeters for measurements of gamma rays as well as a medium for detecting hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, it should, theoretically, strip an electron and create a primary scintillation. By using xenon, this burst of energy could then be readily distinguished from similar events caused by particles such as cosmic rays. However, the XENON experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy and the ZEPLIN-II and ZEPLIN-III experiments at the Boulby Underground Laboratory in the UK have thus far failed to find any confirmed WIMPs. Even if no WIMPs are detected, the experiments will serve to constrain the properties of dark matter and some physics models. The current detector at the Gran Sasso facility has demonstrated sensitivity comparable to that of the best cryogenic detectors, and the sensitivity was expected to be increased by an order of magnitude in 2009.</p>\n<p>Xenon is the preferred propellant for ion propulsion of spacecraft because of its low ionization potential per atomic weight, and its ability to be stored as a liquid at near room temperature (under high pressure) yet be easily converted back into a gas to feed the engine. The inert nature of xenon makes it environmentally friendly and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium. Xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s. It was later employed as a propellant for JPL's Deep Space 1 probe, Europe's SMART-1 spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on NASA's Dawn Spacecraft.</p>\n<p>Chemically, the perxenate compounds are used as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry. Xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon, particularly in the production of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil. Xenon is also used in protein crystallography. Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5&nbsp;MPa (5 to 50&nbsp;atm) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative, which can be used for solving the phase problem.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Many oxygen-containing xenon compounds are toxic due to their strong oxidative properties, and explosive due to their tendency to break down into elemental xenon plus diatomic oxygen (O), which contains much stronger chemical bonds than the xenon compounds.</p>\n<p>Xenon gas can be safely kept in normal sealed glass or metal containers at standard temperature and pressure. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials. Xenon is non-toxic, although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to a select group of substances that penetrate the blood–brain barrier, causing mild to full surgical anesthesia when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen.</p>\n<p>At 169&nbsp;m/s, the speed of sound in xenon gas is slower than that in air due to the slower average speed of the heavy xenon atoms compared to nitrogen and oxygen molecules. Hence, xenon lowers the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract when inhaled. This produces a characteristic lowered voice timbre, an effect opposite to the high-timbred voice caused by inhalation of helium. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen. Xenon is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, many universities no longer allow the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. As xenon is expensive, the gas sulfur hexafluoride, which is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), is generally used in this stunt, and is an asphyxiant without being anesthetic.</p>\n<p>It is possible to safely breathe heavy gases such as xenon or sulfur hexafluoride when they are in a mixture with oxygen; the oxygen comprising at least 20% of the mixture. Xenon at 80% concentration along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and has been used for this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate at the bottom of the lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and if a person enters a container filled with an odorless, colorless gas, they may find themselves breathing it unknowingly. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Buoyant levitation</li>\n<li>Penning mixture</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Simpson, J.

  "title": "Barium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with Borium.</div>\n\n<p><b>Barium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Ba</b> and atomic number&nbsp;56. It is the fifth element in Group 2, a soft silvery metallic alkaline earth metal. Because of its high chemical reactivity barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide was known in pre-modern history as baryta; this substance does not occur as a mineral, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.</p>\n<p>The most common naturally occurring minerals of barium are barite (barium sulfate, BaSO) and witherite (barium carbonate, BaCO), both being insoluble in water. Barium's name originates from the alchemical derivative \"baryta\", which itself comes from Greek βαρύς (<i>barys</i>), meaning \"heavy.\" Barium was identified as a new element in 1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808, shortly after electrolytic isolation techniques became available.</p>\n<p>Barium has only a few industrial applications. The metal has been historically used to scavenge air in vacuum tubes. It is a component of YBCO (high-temperature superconductors) and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure of the metal. Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color. Barium sulfate is used as an insoluble heavy additive to oil well drilling fluid, and in purer form, as X-ray radiocontrast agents for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. Soluble barium compounds are poisonous due to release of the soluble barium ion, and therefore have been used as rodenticides.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOxidized barium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with a slight golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon oxidation in air yielding a dark gray oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium is very hard to prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.</p>\n<p>At room temperature and pressure, barium has a body-centered cubic structure, with a barium–barium distance of 503 picometers, expanding with heating at a rate of approximately 1.8×10/°C. It is a very soft metal with a Mohs hardness of 1.25. Its melting temperature of 1,000 K (730&nbsp;°C; 1,340&nbsp;°F) is intermediate between those of the lighter strontium (1,050&nbsp;K or 780&nbsp;°C; 1,430&nbsp;°F) and heavier radium (973&nbsp;K or 700&nbsp;°C; 1,292&nbsp;°F); however, its boiling point of 2,170 K (1,900&nbsp;°C; 3,450&nbsp;°F) exceeds that of strontium (1,655&nbsp;K or 1,382&nbsp;°C; 2,519&nbsp;°F). The density (3.62&nbsp;g·cm) is again intermediate between those of strontium (2.36&nbsp;g·cm) and radium (~5&nbsp;g·cm).</p>\n<h3>Chemical reactivity</h3>\n<p>Barium is chemically similar to magnesium, calcium, and strontium, being even more reactive. It always exhibits the oxidation state of +2. Reactions with chalcogens are highly exothermic (release energy); the reaction with oxygen or air occurs at room temperature, and therefore barium is stored under oil or inert gas atmosphere. Reactions with other nonmetals, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and hydrogen, are generally exothermic and proceed upon heating. Reactions with water and alcohols are also very exothermic and release hydrogen gas:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Ba + 2 ROH → Ba(OR) + H↑ (R is an alkyl or a hydrogen atom)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Additionally, barium reacts with ammonia to form complexes such as Ba(NH).</p>\n<p>The metal is readily attacked by most acids. Sulfuric acid is a notable exception, as passivation stops the reaction by forming the insoluble barium sulfate. Barium combines with several metals, including aluminium, zinc, lead, and tin, forming intermetallic phases and alloys.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n\n<p>Barium salts are typically white when solid and colorless when dissolved, as barium ions provide no specific coloring. They are also denser than their strontium or calcium analogs, except for the halides (see table; zinc is given for comparison).</p>\n<p>Barium hydroxide (\"baryta\") was known to alchemists who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.</p>\n<p>Volatile barium compounds burn with a green to pale green flame, which is an efficient test to detect a barium compound. The color results from spectral lines at 455.4, 493.4, 553.6, and 611.1&nbsp;nm.</p>\n<p>Organobarium compounds are a growing class of compounds: for example, dialkylbariums are known, as are alkylhalobariums.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of barium</div>\n<p>Barium occurs naturally on Earth as a mixture of seven primordial nuclides, barium-130, 132, and 134 through 138. The first two are thought to be radioactive: barium-130 should decay to xenon-130 via double beta plus decay, and barium-132 should similarly decay to xenon-132. The corresponding half-lives should exceed the age of the Universe by at least thousand times. Their abundances are ~0.1% relative to that of natural barium. Their radioactivity is so weak that they pose no danger to life. Out of the stable isotopes, barium-138 makes up 71.7% of all barium, and the lighter the isotope, the less it is abundant. In total, barium has about 50 known isotopes, ranging in mass between 114 and 153. The most stable metastable isotope is barium-133, which has a half-life of approximately 10.51&nbsp;years, and five more isotopes have their half-lives longer than a day. Barium also has 10 meta states, out of which barium-133m1 is the most stable, having a half-live of about 39 hours.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSir Humphry Davy, who first isolated barium metal</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Alchemists in the early Middle Ages knew about some barium minerals. Smooth pebble-like stones of mineral barite found in Bologna, Italy, were known as \"Bologna stones.\" Witches and alchemists were attracted to them because after exposure to light they would glow for years. The phosphorescent properties of barite heated with organics were described by V. Casciorolus in 1602.</p>\n<p>Carl Scheele identified barite as containing a new element in 1774, but could not isolate barium, only barium oxide. Johan Gottlieb Gahn also isolated barium oxide two years later in similar studies. Oxidized barium was at first called \"barote,\" by Guyton de Morveau, a name that was changed by Antoine Lavoisier to <i>baryta.</i> Also in the 18th century, English mineralogist William Withering noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of Cumberland, now known to be witherite. Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808, by Sir Humphry Davy in England. Davy, by analogy with calcium named \"barium\" after baryta, with the \"-ium\" ending signifying a metallic element. Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of barium chloride and ammonium chloride.</p>\n<p>The production of pure oxygen in the Brin process was a large-scale application of barium peroxide in the 1880s, before it was replaced by electrolysis and fractional distillation of liquefied air in the early 1900s. In this process barium oxide reacts at 500–600&nbsp;°C (932–1112&nbsp;°F) with air to form barium peroxide, which decomposes at above 700 °C (1,292&nbsp;°F) by releasing oxygen:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 BaO + O ⇌ 2 BaO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1908, barium sulfate was first applied as a radiocontrast agent in X-ray imaging of the digestive system.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<p>The abundance of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13&nbsp;µg/L in sea water. The main commercial source of barium is barite (also called barytes or heavy spar), which is a barium sulfate mineral. Its deposits are spread all over the world. The only other commercial source is far less important than barite; it is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. Its main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>Barite, left to right: appearance, graph showing trends in production over time, and the map showing shares of the most important producer countries in 2010.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The barite reserves are estimated between 0.7 and 2 billion tonnes. The maximum production was achieved in 1981, at 8.3 million tonnes, and only 7–8% of it was used to make barium or its compounds. The barite production has again risen since the second half of the 1990s: from 5.6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7.6 in 2005 and 7.8 in 2011. China accounts for more than 50% of this output, followed by India (14% in 2011), Morocco (8.3%), US (8.2%), Turkey (2.5%), Iran and Kazakhstan (2.6% each).</p>\n<p>The mined ore is washed, crushed, classified, and separated from quartz. If the quartz penetrates too deep into the ore, or the iron, zinc, or lead content is abnormally high, then froth flotation methods are applied. The product is a 98% pure barite (by mass); the purity should be no less than 95%, with a minimal content of iron and silicon dioxide. It is then reduced by carbon to barium sulfide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>BaSO + 2 C → BaS + 2 CO↑</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The water-soluble barium sulfide is the starting point for other compounds: dissolved BaS upon reaction with oxygen gives the hydroxide, with nitric acid the nitrate, with carbon dioxide the carbonate, and so on. The nitrate can be thermally decomposed to yield the oxide. Barium metal is produced by reduction with aluminium at 1,100 °C (2,010&nbsp;°F). The intermetallic compound BaAl is produced first:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 BaO + 14 Al → 3 BaAl + AlO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It is an intermediate, which reacts with barium oxide to give the metal. Note that not all barium is reduced.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>8 BaO + BaAl → Ba↑ + 7 BaAlO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The remaining barium oxide reacts with the formed aluminium oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>BaO + AlO → BaAlO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>and the overall reaction is</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 BaO + 2 Al → 3 Ba↑ + BaAlO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The thus produced barium vapor is collected at the cooler part of the apparatus and then packed into molds under argon atmosphere. This method is used commercially and can yield ultrapure barium. Commonly sold barium is about 99% pure, with main impurities being strontium and calcium (up to 0.8% and 0.25%) and other contaminants contributing less than 0.1%.</p>\n<p>A similar reaction with silicon at 1,200 °C (2,190&nbsp;°F) yields barium and barium metasilicate. Electrolysis is not used because barium readily dissolves in molten halides and is rather impure when isolated with this method.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBenitoite crystals on natrolite. The mineral is named for the San Benito River in San Benito County where it was first found.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Gemstone</h3>\n<p>A barium-containing mineral benitoite (barium titanium silicate) occurs as a very rare blue fluorescent gemstone, and is the official state gem of California.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Metal and alloys</h3>\n<p>Barium, as a metal or when alloyed with aluminium, is used to remove unwanted gases (gettering) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes. Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.</p>\n<p>Other uses of elemental barium are minor and include an additive to silumin (aluminium–silicon alloys) that refines their structure, as well as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bearing alloys;</li>\n<li>lead–tin soldering alloys – to increase the creep resistance;</li>\n<li>alloy with nickel for spark plugs;</li>\n<li>additive to steel and cast iron as an inoculant;</li>\n<li>alloys with calcium, manganese, silicon, and aluminium as high-grade steel deoxidizers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Barium sulfate and barite</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAmoebiasis as seen in radiograph of barium-filled colon</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Barium sulfate (the mineral barite, BaSO) is important to the petroleum industry, for example, as a drilling fluid in oil and gas wells. The precipitate of the compound (called \"blanc fixe\", from a French expression meaning \"permanent white\") is used in paints and varnishes, and also as a filler in ringing ink, plastics, and rubbers. It is also a paper coating pigment. In the form of nanoparticles, it can improve physical properties of some polymers, such as epoxies.</p>\n<p>Barium sulfate has a low toxicity and relatively high density of ca. 4.5 g·cm (and thus opacity to X-rays). For this reason it is used as a radiocontrast agent in X-ray imaging of the digestive system (\"barium meals\" and \"barium enemas\"). Lithopone, a pigment that contains barium sulfate and zinc sulfide, is a permanent white that has good covering power, and does not darken when exposed to sulfides.</p>\n<h3>Other barium compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGreen barium fireworks</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Aside from the sulfate, other compounds of barium find only niche applications. Applications are limited by the toxicity of Ba ions (barium carbonate is a rat poison), which is not a problem for the insoluble BaSO.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Barium oxide is used in a coating for the electrodes of fluorescent lamps, which facilitates the release of electrons.</li>\n<li>Barium carbonate is used in glassmaking. Being a heavy element, barium increases the refractive index and luster of the glass. The compound is also used to reduce leaks of X-rays from cathode ray tubes (CRT) TV sets.</li>\n<li>Barium, typically as barium nitrate, is added to fireworks to impart them a green color. The species responsible for the brilliant green is barium monochloride; in the absence of chlorine a yellow or \"apple\" green is produced instead.</li>\n<li>Barium peroxide can be used as a catalyst to start an aluminothermic reaction when welding rail tracks together. It can also be used in green tracer ammunition and as a bleaching agent.</li>\n<li>Barium titanate is a promising electroceramic.</li>\n<li>Barium fluoride is used for optics in infrared applications because of its wide transparency range of 0.15–12&nbsp;micrometers.</li>\n<li>YBCO was the first high-temperature superconductor that could be cooled by liquid nitrogen, as its transition temperature of 93 K (−180.2&nbsp;°C; −292.3&nbsp;°F) exceeded the boiling point of nitrogen (77&nbsp;K or −196.2&nbsp;°C; −321.1&nbsp;°F).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biological dangers and precautions</h2>\n<p>Because of the high reactivity of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. At low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, whereas higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, dyspnea and paralysis. This may be due to the ability of Ba to block potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other target organs for water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin. They affect the body strongly, causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.</p>\n<p>Barium is not carcinogenic, and it does not bioaccumulate. However, inhaled dust containing insoluble barium compounds can accumulate in the lungs, causing a benign condition called baritosis. For comparison to the soluble poisons, the insoluble sulfate is nontoxic and is thus not classified as a dangerous good.</p>\n<p>To avoid a potentially vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal is kept under argon or mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous, as it may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, reactions with oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Everything that may make contact with barium should be grounded. Those who work with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask; they are not allowed to smoke in the working area and must wash themselves after handling barium.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Han purple and Han blue</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^       Ullman 2005, p.&nbsp;2.</li>\n<li>^   Lide 2004, p.&nbsp;4-43.</li>\n<li>^    Lide 2004, p.&nbsp;4-86.</li>\n<li>^   Lide 2004, p.&nbsp;4-78.</li>\n<li>^ Ullman 2005, pp.&nbsp;2–3.</li>\n<li>^             Ullman 2005, p.&nbsp;3.</li>\n<li>^ Müller, Hermann (2007). \"Sulfuric Acid and Sulfur Trioxide\".

  "title": "Lanthanum",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Lanthanum</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>La</b> and atomic number 57. Lanthanum is a silvery white metallic element that belongs to group 3 of the periodic table and is the first element of the lanthanide series. It is found in some rare-earth minerals, usually in combination with cerium and other rare earth elements. Lanthanum is a malleable, ductile, and soft metal that oxidizes rapidly when exposed to air. It is produced from the minerals monazite and bastnäsite using a complex multistage extraction process. Lanthanum compounds have numerous applications as catalysts, additives in glass, carbon lighting for studio lighting and projection, ignition elements in lighters and torches, electron cathodes, scintillators, and others. Lanthanum carbonate (La(CO)) was approved as a medication against renal failure.</p>\n\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Lanthanum is a soft, malleable, silvery white metal which has hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310 °C, lanthanum changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865 °C into a body-centered cubic structure. Lanthanum is easily oxidized (a centimeter-sized sample will completely oxidize within a year) and is therefore used in elemental form only for research purposes. For example, single Lanthanum atoms have been isolated by implanting them into fullerene molecules. If carbon nanotubes are filled with those lanthanum-encapsulated fullerenes and annealed, metallic nanochains of lanthanum are produced inside carbon nanotubes.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Lanthanum exhibits two oxidation states, +3 and +2, the former being much more stable. For example, LaH is more stable than LaH. Lanthanum burns readily at 150&nbsp;°C to form lanthanum(III) oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 La + 3 O → 2 LaO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>However, when exposed to moist air at room temperature, lanthanum oxide forms a hydrated oxide with a large volume increase.</p>\n<p>Lanthanum is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form lanthanum hydroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 La (s) + 6 HO (l) → 2 La(OH) (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Lanthanum metal reacts with all the halogens. The reaction is vigorous if conducted above 200 °C:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 La (s) + 3 F (g) → 2 LaF (s)</dd>\n<dd>2 La (s) + 3 Cl (g) → 2 LaCl (s)</dd>\n<dd>2 La (s) + 3 Br (g) → 2 LaBr (s)</dd>\n<dd>2 La (s) + 3 I (g) → 2 LaI (s)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Lanthanum dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the La(III) ions, which exist as [La(OH)] complexes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 La(s) + 3 HSO (aq) → 2 La(aq) + 3 SO2−\n4 (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Lanthanum combines with nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic at elevated temperatures, forming binary compounds. The electron configuration of the colourless La ion is [Xe] 4f.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of lanthanum</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring lanthanum is composed of one stable (La) and one radioactive (La) isotope, with the stable isotope, La, being the most abundant (99.91% natural abundance). 38 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being La with a half-life of 1.05×10 years, and La with a half-life of 60,000 years. Most of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 24 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives less than 1 minute. This element also has three meta states.</p>\n<p>The isotopes of lanthanum range in atomic weight from 117 u (La) to 155 u (La).</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The word <i>lanthanum</i> comes from the Greek <i>λανθανω</i> [lanthanō] = to lie hidden. Lanthanum was discovered in 1839 by Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander, when he partially decomposed a sample of cerium nitrate by heating and treating the resulting salt with dilute nitric acid. From the resulting solution, he isolated a new rare earth he called <i>lantana</i>. Lanthanum was isolated in relatively pure form in 1923.</p>\n<p>Lanthanum is the most strongly basic of all the trivalent lanthanides, and this property is what allowed Mosander to isolate and purify the salts of this element. Basicity separation as operated commercially involved the fractional precipitation of the weaker bases (such as didymium) from nitrate solution by the addition of magnesium oxide or dilute ammonia gas. Purified lanthanum remained in solution. (The basicity methods were only suitable for lanthanum purification; didymium could not be efficiently further separated in this manner.) The alternative technique of fractional crystallization was invented by Dmitri Mendeleev, in the form of the double ammonium nitrate tetrahydrate, which he used to separate the less-soluble lanthanum from the more-soluble didymium in the 1870s. This system was used commercially in lanthanum purification until the development of practical solvent extraction methods that started in the late 1950s. (A detailed process using the double ammonium nitrates to provide 99.99% pure lanthanum, neodymium concentrates and praseodymium concentrates is presented in Callow 1967, at a time when the process was just becoming obsolete.) As operated for lanthanum purification, the double ammonium nitrates were recrystallized from water. When later adapted by Carl Auer von Welsbach for the splitting of didymium, nitric acid was used as a solvent to lower the solubility of the system. Lanthanum is relatively easy to purify, since it has only one adjacent lanthanide, cerium, which itself is very readily removed due to its potential tetravalency.</p>\n<p>The fractional crystallization purification of lanthanum as the double ammonium nitrate was sufficiently rapid and efficient, that lanthanum purified in this manner was not expensive. The Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash and Chemical Corporation, for a while the largest producer of rare earths in the world, in a price list dated October 1, 1958 priced 99.9% lanthanum ammonium nitrate (oxide content of 29%) at $3.15 per pound, or $1.93 per pound in 50-pound quantities. The corresponding oxide (slightly purer at 99.99%) was priced at $11.70 or $7.15 per pound for the two quantity ranges. The price for their purest grade of oxide (99.997%) was $21.60 and $13.20, respectively.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>See also categories: Lanthanide minerals&nbsp;and Lanthanum compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<center>Monazite</center>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Although lanthanum belongs to the element group called rare earth metals, it is not rare at all. Lanthanum is available in relatively large quantities (32 ppm in Earth’s crust). \"Rare earths\" got their name because they were indeed rare as compared to the \"common\" earths such as lime or magnesia, and historically only a few deposits were known. Lanthanum is taken into consideration as a rare earth metal because the process to mine is difficult, time consuming and expensive.</p>\n<p>Monazite (Ce, La, Th, Nd, Y)PO, and bastnäsite (Ce, La, Y)COF, are the principal ores in which lanthanum occurs, in percentages of up to 25 to 38 percent of the total lanthanide content. In general, there is more lanthanum in bastnäsite than in monazite. Until 1949, bastnäsite was a rare and obscure mineral, not even remotely contemplated as a potential commercial source for lanthanides. In that year, the large deposit at the Mountain Pass rare earth mine in California was discovered. This discovery alerted geologists to the existence of a new class of rare earth deposit, the rare-earth bearing carbonatite, other examples of which soon surfaced, particularly in Africa and China.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>Main article: Monazite</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p>Lanthanum is most commonly obtained from monazite and bastnäsite. The mineral mixtures are crushed and ground. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO. Lanthanum is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. This salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue.</p>\n<p>The most efficient separation routine for lanthanum salt from the rare-earth salt solution is, however, ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are adsorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by a suitable complexing agent, such as ammonium citrate or nitrilotriacetate. Lanthanum can also be separated from a solution of rare earth nitrates by liquid-liquid extraction with a suitable organic liquid, such as tributyl phosphalate. Currently, the most widely used extractant for the purification of lanthanum and the other lanthanides is the 2-ethylhexyl ester of 2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid; this has better handling characteristics than the previously used bis-2-ethylhexyl phosphate.</p>\n<p>Lanthanum metal is obtained from its oxide by heating it with ammonium chloride or fluoride and hydrofluoric acid at 300-400 °C to produce the chloride or fluoride:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>LaO + 6 NHCl → 2 LaCl + 6 NH + 3 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This is followed by reduction with alkali or alkaline earth metals in vacuum or argon atmosphere:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>LaCl + 3 Li → La + 3 LiCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Also, pure lanthanum can be produced by electrolysis of molten mixture of anhydrous LaCl and NaCl or KCl at elevated temperatures.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA Coleman white gas lantern mantle burning at full brightness.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The first historical application of lanthanum was in gas lantern mantles. Carl Auer von Welsbach used a mixture of 60% magnesium oxide, 20% lanthanum oxide and 20% yttrium oxide which he called <i>Actinophor</i>, and patented in 1885. The original mantles gave a green-tinted light and were not very successful, and his first company, which established a factory in Atzgersdorf in 1887, failed in 1889.</p>\n<p>Modern uses of lanthanum include:</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLaB hot cathode</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nComparison of infrared transmittance of ZBLAN glass and silica</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>One material used for anodic material of nickel-metal hydride batteries is La(NiMnAlCo. Due to high cost to extract the other lanthanides a mischmetal with more than 50% of lanthanum is used instead of pure lanthanum. The compound is an intermetallic component of the AB type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As most hybrid cars use nickel-metal hydride batteries, massive quantities of lanthanum are required for the production of hybrid automobiles. A typical hybrid automobile battery for a Toyota Prius requires 10 to 15&nbsp;kg (22-33&nbsp;lb) of lanthanum. As engineers push the technology to increase fuel mileage, twice that amount of lanthanum could be required per vehicle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hydrogen sponge alloys can contain lanthanum. These alloys are capable of storing up to 400 times their own volume of hydrogen gas in a reversible adsorption process. Heat energy is released every time they do so; therefore these alloys have possibilities in energy conservation systems.</li>\n<li>Mischmetal, a pyrophoric alloy used in lighter flints, contains 25% to 45% lanthanum.</li>\n<li>Lanthanum oxide and the boride are used in electronic vacuum tubes as hot cathode materials with strong emissivity of electrons. Crystals of LaB are used in high brightness, extended life, thermionic electron emission sources for electron microscopes and Hall effect thrusters.</li>\n<li>Lanthanum fluoride (LaF) is an essential component of a heavy fluoride glass named ZBLAN. This glass has superior transmittance in the infrared range and is therefore used for fiber-optical communication systems.</li>\n<li>Cerium doped lanthanum bromide and lanthanum chloride are the recent inorganic scintillators which have a combination of high light yield, best energy resolution and fast response. Their high yield converts into superior energy resolution; moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide range of temperatures, making it particularly attractive for high temperature applications. These scintillators are already widely used commercially in detectors of neutrons or gamma rays.</li>\n<li>Carbon arc lamps use a mixture of rare earth elements to improve the light quality. This application, especially by the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projection, consumed about 25% of the rare-earth compounds produced until the phase out of Carbon arc lamps.</li>\n<li>Lanthanum(III) oxide (LaO) improves the alkali resistance of glass, and is used in making special optical glasses, such as infrared-absorbing glass, as well as camera and telescope lenses, because of the high refractive index and low dispersion of rare-earth glasses. Lanthanum oxide is also used as a grain growth additive during the liquid phase sintering of silicon nitride and zirconium diboride.</li>\n<li>Small amounts of lanthanum added to steel improves its malleability, resistance to impact and ductility.

The element is very poorly absorbed after oral administration and when injected its elimination is very slow. Lanthanum carbonate was approved as a medication named Fosrenol to absorb excess phosphate in cases of end-stage renal failure.</p>\n<p>While lanthanum has pharmacological effects on several receptors and ion channels, its specificity for the GABA receptor is unique among divalent cations. Lanthanum acts at the same modulatory site on the GABA receptor as zinc- a known negative allosteric modulator. The Lanthanum cation La is a positive allosteric modulator at native and recombinant GABA receptors, increasing open channel time and decreasing desensitization in a subunit configuration dependent manner.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Lanthanum has a low to moderate level of toxicity and should be handled with care. In animals, the injection of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, sometimes led to pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.

  "title": "Cerium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Cerium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Ce</b> and atomic number&nbsp;58. It is a soft, silvery, ductile metal which easily oxidizes in air. Cerium was named after the dwarf planet Ceres (itself named for the Roman goddess of agriculture). Cerium is the most abundant of the rare earth elements, making up about 0.0046% of the Earth's crust by weight. It is found in a number of minerals, the most important being monazite and bastnasite. Commercial applications of cerium are numerous. They include catalysts, additives to fuel to reduce emissions and to glass and enamels to change their color. Cerium oxide is an important component of glass polishing powders and phosphors used in screens and fluorescent lamps. It is also used in the \"flint\" (actually ferrocerium) of lighters.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Cerium is a silvery metal, belonging to the lanthanide group. It resembles iron in color and luster, but is soft, and both malleable and ductile. Cerium has the third-longest liquid range of any element: 2648&nbsp;C° (795&nbsp;°C to 3443&nbsp;°C) or 4766&nbsp;F° (1463&nbsp;°F to 6229&nbsp;°F). (Only neptunium and thorium have longer liquid ranges.)</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPhase diagram of cerium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Cerium has a variable electronic structure. The energy of the inner 4f level is nearly the same as that of the outer or valence electrons, and only small energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valency states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed. The low temperature behavior of cerium is complex. Four allotropic modifications are thought to exist: cerium at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure is known as γ-cerium. Upon cooling to –16&nbsp;°C, γ-cerium changes to β-cerium. The remaining γ-cerium starts to change to α-cerium when cooled to –172&nbsp;°C, and the transformation is complete at –269&nbsp;°C. α-cerium has a density of 8.16; δ-cerium exists above 726&nbsp;°C. At atmospheric pressure, liquid cerium is more dense than its solid form at the melting point.</p>\n<p>Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or scratched, the resulting shavings catch fire.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Cerium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily at 150&nbsp;°C to form cerium(IV) oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Ce + O → CeO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Cerium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form cerium hydroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Ce (s) + 6 HO (l) → 2 Ce(OH) (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Cerium metal reacts with all the halogens:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Ce (s) + 3 F (g) → 2 CeF (s) [white]</dd>\n<dd>2 Ce (s) + 3 Cl (g) → 2 CeCl (s) [white]</dd>\n<dd>2 Ce (s) + 3 Br (g) → 2 CeBr (s) [white]</dd>\n<dd>2 Ce (s) + 3 I (g) → 2 CeI (s) [yellow]</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Cerium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the colorless Ce(III) ions, which exist as a [Ce(OH)] complexes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Ce (s) + 3 HSO (aq) → 2 Ce (aq) + 3 SO2−\n4 (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>See also category: Cerium compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCerium(IV) sulfate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Cerium(IV) (ceric) salts are orange red or yellowish, whereas cerium(III) (cerous) salts are usually white or colorless. Both oxidation states absorb ultraviolet light strongly. Cerium(III) can be used to make glasses that are colorless, yet absorb ultraviolet light almost completely. Cerium can be readily detected in rare earth mixtures by a very sensitive qualitative test: addition of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide to an aqueous solution of lanthanides produces a characteristic dark brown color if cerium is present.</p>\n<p>Cerium exhibits three oxidation states, +2, +3 and +4. The +2 state is rare and is observed in CeH, CeI and CeS. The most common compound of cerium is cerium(IV) oxide (CeO), which is used as \"Jeweller's rouge\" as well as in the walls of some self-cleaning ovens. Two common oxidizing agents used in titrations are ammonium cerium(IV) sulfate (ceric ammonium sulfate, (NH)Ce(SO)) and ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate (ceric ammonium nitrate or CAN, (NH)Ce(NO)). Cerium also forms a chloride, CeCl or cerium(III) chloride, used to facilitate reactions at carbonyl groups in organic chemistry. Other compounds include cerium(III) carbonate (Ce(CO)), cerium(III) fluoride (CeF), cerium(III) oxide (CeO), as well as cerium(IV) sulfate (ceric sulfate, Ce(SO)) and cerium(III) triflate (Ce(OSOCF)).</p>\n<p>The two oxidation states of cerium differ enormously in basicity: cerium(III) is a strong base, comparable to the other trivalent lanthanides, but cerium(IV) is weak. This difference has always allowed cerium to be by far the most readily isolated and purified of all the lanthanides, otherwise a notoriously difficult group of elements to separate. A wide range of procedures have been devised over the years to exploit the difference. These include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Leaching the mixed hydroxides with dilute nitric acid: the trivalent lanthanides dissolve in cerium-free condition, and tetravalent cerium remains in the insoluble residue as a concentrate to be further purified by other means. A variation on this uses hydrochloric acid and the calcined oxides from bastnasite, but the separation is less sharp.</li>\n<li>Precipitating cerium from a nitrate or chloride solution using potassium permanganate and sodium carbonate in a 1:4 molar ratio.</li>\n<li>Boiling rare-earth nitrate solutions with potassium bromate and marble chips.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Formerly used commercially was a method whereby a solution of cerium(IV) in nitric acid would be added to dilute sulfuric acid. This caused cerium(IV) to largely precipitate as a basic salt, leaving trivalent lanthanide in solution. However, the finely divided precipitate was difficult to filter from the highly corrosive medium. Using the classical methods of rare-earth separation, there was a considerable advantage to a strategy of removing cerium from the mixture at the beginning. Cerium typically comprised 45% of the cerite or monazite rare earths, and removing it early greatly reduced the bulk of what needed to be further processed (or the cost of reagents to be associated with such processing). However, not all cerium purification methods relied on basicity. Ceric ammonium nitrate [ammonium hexanitratocerate(IV)] crystallization from nitric acid was one purification method. Cerium(IV) nitrate (hexanitratoceric acid) was more readily extractable into certain solvents (e.g. tri-n-butyl phosphate) than the trivalent lanthanides. However, modern practice in China seems to be to do purification of cerium by counter-current solvent extraction, in its trivalent form, just like the other lanthanides.</p>\n<p>Cerium(IV) is a strong oxidant under acidic conditions, but stable under alkaline conditions, when it is cerium(III) that becomes a strong reductant, easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen (O). This ease of oxidation under alkaline conditions leads to the occasional geochemical parting of the ways between cerium and the trivalent light lanthanides under supergene weathering conditions, leading variously to the \"negative cerium anomaly\" or to the formation of the mineral cerianite. Air-oxidation of alkaline cerium(III) is the most economical way to get to cerium(IV), which can then be handled in acid solution.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of cerium</div>\n<p>There are four isotopes of cerium that occur naturally. These are 140Ce, which makes up 88.5% of cerium on earth; 142Ce, which makes up 11% of cerium on earth; 138Ce, which makes up 0.3% of cerium on earth; and 136Ce, which makes up 0.2% of cerium on Earth. However, only 140Ce is stable. 142Ce, 138Ce, and 136Ce have half-lives of 5×10 years, 1.5×10 years, and 70 trillion years respectively. Additionally, some isotopes of cerium occur naturally in trace amounts as the result of fission of uranium.</p>\n<p>39 isotopes of cerium have been discovered altogether. They range from 119Ce to 157Ce. Cerium also has 10 known nuclear isomers.  Aside from the nearly-stable isotopes, the longest-lived isotopeS of cerium are 139Ce and 144Cd, which have half-lives on the order of 10 seconds (115.74 days). An additional eight isotopes have half-lives greater than 1000 seconds (16 minutes and 40 seconds). All but 16 isotopes of cerium have half-lives greater than 1 second. The least stable isotopes whose half-lives are known are 153Ce, 154Ce and 155Ce. They have half-lives on the order of 10 seconds. All the isotopes lighter than 140Ce decay by electron capture or β decay. All the isotopes heavier than 140Ce decay by β decay.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Cerium was discovered in Bastnäs in Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger, and independently in Germany by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, both in 1803. Cerium was named by Berzelius after the dwarf planet Ceres, discovered two years earlier (1801). As originally isolated, cerium was in the form of its oxide, and was named <i>ceria</i>, a term that is still used. The metal itself was too electropositive to be isolated by then-current smelting technology, a characteristic of rare earth metals in general. After the development of electrochemistry by Humphry Davy five years later, the earths soon yielded the metals they contained. Ceria, as isolated in 1803, contained all of the lanthanides present in the cerite ore from Bastnäs, Sweden, and thus only contained about 45% of what is now known to be pure ceria. It was not until Carl Gustaf Mosander succeeded in removing lanthana and \"didymia\" in the late 1830s, that ceria was obtained pure. Wilhelm Hisinger was a wealthy mine owner and amateur scientist, and sponsor of Berzelius. He owned or controlled the mine at Bastnäs, and had been trying for years to find out the composition of the abundant heavy gangue rock (the \"Tungsten of Bastnäs\"), now known as cerite, that he had in his mine. Mosander and his family lived for many years in the same house as Berzelius, and Mosander was undoubtedly persuaded by Berzelius to investigate ceria further.</p>\n<p>When the rare earths were first discovered, since they were strong bases like the oxides of calcium or magnesium, they were thought to be divalent. Thus, \"ceric\" cerium was thought to be trivalent, and the oxidation state ratio was therefore thought to be 1.5. Berzelius was annoyed to keep on getting the correct ratio 1.33.</p>\n<p>In the late 1950s, the Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash and Chemical Corporation of West Chicago, Illinois, then the largest producer of rare earths in the world, was offering cerium compounds in two purity ranges, \"commercial\" at 94–97% purity, and \"purified\", at a reported 99.9+% purity. In their October 1, 1958 price list, one-pound quantities of the oxides were priced at $3.30 or $8.10 respectively for the two purities; the per-pound price for 50-pound quantities were respectively $1.95 or $4.95 for the two grades. Cerium salts were proportionately cheaper, reflecting their lower net content of oxide.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>See also: Category:Lanthanide minerals</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAllanite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Cerium is the most abundant of the rare earth elements, making up about 0.0046% of the Earth's crust by weight. It is found in a number of minerals including allanite (also known as orthite)—(Ca,Ce,La,Y)(Al,Fe)(SiO)(OH), monazite (Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)PO, bastnasite (Ce,La,Y)COF, hydroxylbastnasite (Ce,La,Nd)CO(OH,F), rhabdophane (Ce,La,Nd)PO-HO, zircon (ZrSiO), and synchysite Ca(Ce,La,Nd,Y)(CO)F. Monazite and bastnasite are presently the two most important sources of cerium. Large deposits of monazite, allanite, and bastnasite will supply cerium, thorium, and other rare-earth metals for many years to come.</p>\n<p>Cerium content in the soil varies between 2 and 150 parts per million (ppm), with an average of 50 ppm. Seawater contains 1.5 parts per trillion of cerium. There is almost no cerium in the atmosphere.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>The mineral mixtures are crushed, ground and treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose salts are insoluble in HNO. Metallic cerium is prepared by metallothermic reduction techniques, such as by reducing cerium fluoride or chloride with calcium, or by electrolysis of molten cerous chloride or other cerous halides. The metallothermic technique is used to produce high-purity cerium.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>A major technological application for cerium(III) oxide is a catalytic converter for the reduction of CO emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles. In particular, cerium oxide is added into diesel fuels. Another important use of the cerium oxide is a hydrocarbon catalyst in self cleaning ovens, incorporated into oven walls and as a petroleum cracking catalyst in petroleum refining.</p>\n<p>Cerium(IV) oxide is considered one of the most efficient agents for precision polishing of optical components. Cerium compounds are also used in the manufacture of glass, both as a component and as a decolorizer. For example, cerium(IV) oxide in combination with titanium(IV) oxide gives a golden yellow color to glass; it also allows for selective absorption of ultraviolet light in glass. Cerium oxide has a high refractive index and is added to enamel to make it more opaque.</p>\n<p>Cerium(IV) oxide is used in incandescent gas mantles, such as the Welsbach mantle, where it was combined with thorium, lanthanum, magnesium or yttrium oxides. Doped with other rare earth oxides, it has been investigated as a solid electrolyte in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells: The cerium(IV) oxide-cerium(III) oxide cycle or CeO/CeO cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on cerium(IV) oxide and cerium(III) oxide for hydrogen production.</p>\n<p>The photostability of pigments can be enhanced by addition of cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable of to 350 °C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.</p>\n<p>A traditional use of cerium was in the pyrophoric mischmetal alloy used for light flints. Because of the high affinity of cerium to sulfur and oxygen, it is used in various aluminium alloys, and iron alloys. In steels, cerium degasifies and can help reduce sulfides and oxides, and it is a precipitation hardening agent in stainless steel. Adding cerium to cast irons opposes graphitization and produces a malleable iron. Addition of 3–4% of cerium to magnesium alloys, along with 0.2 to 0.6% zirconium, helps refine the grain and give sound casting of complex shapes. It also adds heat resistance to magnesium castings. Cerium metal is sometimes added to aluminum to improve aluminum's corrosion resistance.</p>\n<p>Cerium alloys are used in permanent magnets and in tungsten electrodes for gas tungsten arc welding. Cerium is used in carbon-arc lighting, especially in the motion picture industry. Cerium oxalate is an anti-emetic drug. Cerium(IV) sulfate is used extensively as a volumetric oxidizing agent in quantitative analysis. Ceric ammonium nitrate is a useful one-electron oxidant in organic chemistry, used to oxidatively etch electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Cerium can act similar to calcium in organisms, so accumulates in bones in small amounts. Cerium is also found in small amounts in tobacco plants, barley, and the wood of beech trees. However, very little cerium accumulates in the food chain. Human blood contains 0.001 ppm, human bones contain 3 ppm, and human tissue contains 0.3 ppm of cerium. There is a total of 40 milligrams of cerium in a typical 70-kilogram human. Humans typically consume less than a milligram per day of cerium. Cerium serves no known biological function, but cerium salts can stimulate metabolism.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Cerium, like all rare-earth metals, is of low to moderate toxicity. Cerium is a strong reducing agent and ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80&nbsp;°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water should not be used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when consumed orally, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes. Cerium(IV) oxide is a powerful oxidizing agent at high temperatures and will react with combustible organic materials. While cerium is not radioactive, the impure commercial grade may contain traces of thorium, which is weakly radioactive.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Organocerium chemistry</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Ground levels and ionization energies for the neutral atoms, NIST</li>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^ Jackson, Mark (2002).

  "title": "Praseodymium",
  "html": "\n\n<p><b>Praseodymium</b> is a chemical element that has the symbol <b>Pr</b> and atomic number 59. Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal in the lanthanide group. It is too reactive to be found in native form, and when artificially prepared, it slowly develops a green oxide coating.</p>\n<p>The element was named for the color of its primary oxide. In 1841, Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander extracted a rare earth oxide residue he called \"didymium\" from a residue he called \"lantana,\" in turn separated from cerium salts. In 1885, the Austrian chemist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach separated didymium into two salts of different colors, which he named praseodymium and neodymium. The name praseodymium comes from the Greek <i>prasinos</i> (πράσινος), meaning green, and <i>didymos</i> (δίδυμος), twin.</p>\n<p>Like most rare earth elements, praseodymium most readily forms trivalent Pr(III) ions. These are yellow-green in water solution, and various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium's industrial uses involve its use to filter yellow light from light sources.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal in the lanthanide group. It is somewhat more resistant to corrosion in air than europium, lanthanum, cerium, or neodymium, but it does develop a green oxide coating that spalls off when exposed to air, exposing more metal to oxidation — a centimeter-sized sample of Pr completely oxidizes within a year. For this reason, praseodymium is usually stored under a light mineral oil or sealed in glass.</p>\n<p>Unlike other rare-earth metals, which show antiferromagnetic or/and ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures, Pr is paramagnetic at any temperature above 1 K.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Praseodymium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily at 150&nbsp;°C to form praseodymium(III,IV) oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>12 Pr + 11 O → 2 PrO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Praseodymium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form praseodymium hydroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Pr (s) + 6 HO (l) → 2 Pr(OH) (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Praseodymium metal reacts with all the halogens:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Pr (s) + 3 F (g) → 2 PrF (s) [green]</dd>\n<dd>2 Pr (s) + 3 Cl (g) → 2 PrCl (s) [green]</dd>\n<dd>2 Pr (s) + 3 Br (g) → 2 PrBr (s) [green]</dd>\n<dd>2 Pr (s) + 3 I (g) → 2 PrI (s) [green]</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Praseodymium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing green Pr(III) ions, which exist as a [Pr(OH)] complexes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Pr (s) + 3 HSO (aq) → 2 Pr(aq) + 3 SO2−\n4 (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>See also: Category:Praseodymium compounds</div>\n<p>In its compounds, praseodymium occurs in oxidation states +2, +3 and/or +4. Praseodymium(IV) is a strong oxidant, instantly oxidizing water to elemental oxygen (O), or hydrochloric acid to elemental chlorine. Thus, in aqueous solution, only the +3 oxidation state is encountered. Praseodymium(III) salts are yellow-green and, in solution, present a fairly simple absorption spectrum in the visible region, with a band in the yellow-orange at 589–590&nbsp;nm (which coincides with the sodium emission doublet), and three bands in the blue/violet region, at 444, 468, and 482&nbsp;nm, approximately. These positions vary slightly with the counter-ion. Praseodymium oxide, as obtained by the ignition of salts such as the oxalate or carbonate in air, is essentially black in color (with a hint of brown or green) and contains +3 and +4 praseodymium in a somewhat variable ratio, depending upon the conditions of formation. Its formula is conventionally rendered as PrO.</p>\n<p>Other praseodymium compounds include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fluorides: PrF, PrF, PrF</li>\n<li>Chlorides: PrCl</li>\n<li>Bromides: PrBr, PrBr</li>\n<li>Iodides: PrI, PrI, PrI</li>\n<li>Oxides: PrO, PrO, PrO</li>\n<li>Sulfides: PrS, PrS</li>\n<li>Sulfates: Pr(SO)</li>\n<li>Selenides: PrSe</li>\n<li>Tellurides: PrTe, PrTe</li>\n<li>Nitrides: PrN</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of praseodymium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring praseodymium is composed of one stable isotope, praseodymium-141, which is of use in NMR and EPR spectroscopy. 38 radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being praseodymium-143 with a half-life of 13.57 days and praseodymium-142 with a half-life of 19.12 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than six hours, and the majority of these have half lives that are less than 10 minutes. This element also has 15 nuclear isomers, with the longest-lived being praseodymium-138m, praseodymium-134m, and praseodymium-142m . The nuclei of nuclear isomers exist in a delicate equilibrium or metastability due to at least one nucleon having an excited energy state.</p>\n<p>The isotopes of praseodymium range in mass number from 121 to 159 . The most common decay mode of 20 isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most abundant stable isotope, praseodymium-141 is β decay, primarily forming cerium isotopes (58 protons) as decay products. The most common decay mode for 18 isotopes with mass numbers higher than praseodymium-141 is β decay, primarily forming neodymium isotopes (60 protons) as decay products.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>In 1839 Mosander extracted an oxide he called \"lantana\" (see lanthana), which was the oxide of the newly discovered element lanthanum, from a mixture of crude cerium nitrate. In 1841, Mosander went on to show that \"lantana\" was the most strongly basic of a mixture of rare earth element oxides and was the last to be precipitated from acid solution when base was added, or the first to be dissolved when the mixed oxides were leached with dilute acid. The remaining less-basic rare earth(s) retained the pinkish color, and Mosander called this remaining fraction \"didymium.\" In 1874, Per Teodor Cleve concluded that didymium was in fact two elements, and in 1879, Lecoq de Boisbaudran isolated a new earth, samarium, from \"didymium\" obtained from the mineral samarskite. Crude didymium actually contained three elements, and in 1885, the Austrian chemist baron Carl Auer von Welsbach separated didymium into two elements, praseodymium and neodymium, which gave salts of different colors.</p>\n<p>The name <i>praseodymium</i> comes from the Greek <i>prasinos</i> (πράσινος), meaning green, and <i>didymos</i> (δίδυμος), twin. Praseodymium is frequently misspelled as praseody<b>n</b>ium.</p>\n<p>Leo Moser (son of Ludwig Moser, founder of the Moser Glassworks in what is now Karlovy Vary, Bohemia, in the Czech Republic, not to be confused with Leo Moser, a mathematician) investigated the use of praseodymium in glass coloration in the late 1920s. The result was a yellow-green glass given the name \"Prasemit\". However, a similar color could be achieved with colorants costing only a minute fraction of what praseodymium cost in the late 1920s, such that the color was not popular, few pieces were made, and examples are now extremely rare. Moser also blended praseodymium with neodymium to produce \"Heliolite\" glass (\"Heliolit\" in German), which was more widely accepted. The first enduring commercial use of purified praseodymium, which continues today, is in the form of a yellow-orange stain for ceramics, \"Praseodymium Yellow\", which is a solid-solution of praseodymium in the zirconium silicate (zircon) lattice. This stain has no hint of green in it. By contrast, at sufficiently high loadings, praseodymium glass is distinctly green, rather than pure yellow.</p>\n<p>Using classical separation methods, praseodymium was always difficult to purify. Much less abundant than the lanthanum and neodymium from which it was being separated (cerium having long since been removed by redox chemistry), praseodymium ended up being dispersed among a large number of fractions, and the resulting yields of purified material were low. Praseodymium has historically been a rare earth whose supply has exceeded demand. This has occasionally led to its being offered more cheaply than the far more abundant neodymium. Unwanted as such, much praseodymium has been marketed as a mixture with lanthanum and cerium, or \"LCP\" for the first letters of each of the constituents, for use in replacing the traditional lanthanide mixtures that were inexpensively made from monazite or bastnäsite. LCP is what remains of such mixtures, after the desirable neodymium, and all the heavier, rarer and more valuable lanthanides have been removed, by solvent extraction. However, as technology progresses, it has been found that praseodymium can be incorporated into neodymium-iron-boron magnets, thereby extending the supply of the much in demand neodymium. So LC is starting to replace LCP as a result.</p>\n<p>In the 1930s it was found (Beck) that praseodymium dioxide could be precipitated from KOH/NaOH eutectic melts, by oxidation by electrochemistry, or by sodium chlorate. This formed the basis of a small-scale laboratory purification method.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMonazite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<p>Praseodymium occurs in small quantities in Earth's crust (9.5 ppm). It is found in the rare earth minerals monazite and bastnäsite, typically comprising about 5% of the lanthanides contained therein, and can be recovered from these minerals by an ion exchange process, or by counter-current solvent extraction. Misch metal, used in making cigarette lighters, historically contained about 5% praseodymium metal.</p>\n<p>Praseodymium makes up an average of 8 parts per million of soil's dry weight, though the elements concentration there can be as low as 1 part per million or as high as 15 parts per million. Praseodymium makes up 1 part per trillion of seawater. There is almost no praseodymium in the atmosphere.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPraseodymium-colored glass</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Uses of praseodymium:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As an alloying agent with magnesium to create high-strength metals that are used in aircraft engines.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Praseodymium made up 5 percent of the traditional version of mischmetal.</li>\n<li>Praseodymium is present in the rare earth mixture whose fluoride forms the core of carbon arc lights which are used in the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projector lights.</li>\n<li>Praseodymium compounds give glasses and enamels a yellow color.</li>\n<li>Praseodymium is used to color cubic zirconia yellow-green, to simulate the mineral peridot.</li>\n<li>Praseodymium is a component of didymium glass, which is used to make certain types of welder's and glass blower's goggles.</li>\n<li>Silicate crystals doped with praseodymium ions have been used to slow a light pulse down to a few hundred meters per second.</li>\n<li>Praseodymium alloyed with nickel (PrNi) has such a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed scientists to approach within one thousandth of a degree of absolute zero.</li>\n<li>Doping praseodymium in fluoride glass allows it to be used as a single mode fiber optical amplifier.</li>\n<li>Praseodymium oxide in solid solution with ceria, or with ceria-zirconia, have been used as oxidation catalysts.</li>\n<li>Modern ferrocerium firesteel products, commonly referred to as \"flint\", used in lighters, torch strikers, \"flint and steel\" fire starters, etc., contain around 4% praseodymium.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Like all rare earth metals, praseodymium is of low to moderate toxicity.

  "title": "Neodymium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Neodymium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Nd</b> and atomic number 60. It is a soft silvery metal that tarnishes in air. Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. It is present in significant quantities in the ore minerals monazite and bastnäsite. Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides, and it is usually refined for general use. Although neodymium is classed as a \"rare earth\", it is a fairly common element, no rarer than cobalt, nickel, and copper ore, and is widely distributed in the Earth's crust. Most of the world's neodymium is mined in China.</p>\n<p>Neodymium compounds were first commercially used as glass dyes in 1927, and they remain a popular additive in glasses. The color of neodymium compounds—due to the Nd ion—is often a reddish-purple but it changes with the type of lighting, due to fluorescent effects. Some neodymium-doped glasses are also used in lasers that emit infrared light with wavelengths between 1047 and 1062 nanometers. These have been used in extremely high power applications, such as experiments in inertial confinement fusion.</p>\n<p>Neodymium is also used with various other substrate crystals, such as yttrium aluminum garnet in the Nd:YAG laser. This laser usually emits infrared waves at a wavelength of about 1064 nanometers. The Nd:YAG laser is one of the most commonly used solid-state lasers.</p>\n<p>Another chief use of neodymium is as the free pure element. It is used as a component in the alloys used to make high-strength neodymium magnets – powerful permanent magnets. These magnets are widely used in such products as microphones, professional loudspeakers, in-ear headphones, and computer hard disks, where low magnet mass or volume, or strong magnetic fields are required. Larger neodymium magnets are used in high power versus weight electric motors (for example in hybrid cars) and generators (for example aircraft and wind turbine electric generators).</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Neodymium, a rare earth metal, was present in the classical mischmetal at a concentration of about 18%. Metallic neodymium has a bright, silvery metallic luster, but as one of the more reactive lanthanide rare-earth metals, it quickly oxidizes in ordinary air. The oxide layer that forms then peels off, and this exposes the metal to further oxidation. Thus a centimeter-sized sample of neodymium completely oxidizes within a year.</p>\n<p>Neodymium commonly exists in two allotropic forms, with a transformation from a double hexagonal to a body-centered cubic structure taking place at about 863&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Neodymium metal tarnishes slowly in air and it burns readily at about 150&nbsp;°C to form neodymium(III) oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Nd + 3 O → 2 NdO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Neodymium is a quite electropositive element, and it reacts slowly with cold water, but quite quickly with hot water to form neodymium(III) hydroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Nd (s) + 6 HO (l) → 2 Nd(OH) (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Neodymium metal reacts vigorously with all the halogens:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Nd (s) + 3 F (g) → 2 NdF (s) [a violet substance]</dd>\n<dd>2 Nd (s) + 3 Cl (g) → 2 NdCl (s) [a mauve substance]</dd>\n<dd>2 Nd (s) + 3 Br (g) → 2 NdBr (s) [a violet substance]</dd>\n<dd>2 Nd (s) + 3 I (g) → 2 NdI (s) [a green substance]</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Neodymium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions that contain the lilac Nd(III) ion.

In all, 31 radioisotopes of neodymium have been detected as of 2010, with the most stable radioisotopes being the naturally occurring ones: Nd (alpha decay with a half-life (T) of 2.29×10 years) and Nd (double beta decay, T = 7×10 years, approximately). All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than eleven days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are shorter than 70 seconds. Neodymium also has 13 known meta states, with the most stable one being Nd (T = 5.5 hours), Nd (T = 5.5 minutes) and Nd (T ~ 70 seconds).</p>\n<p>The primary decay modes before the most abundant stable isotope, Nd, are electron capture and positron decay, and the primary mode after is beta minus decay. The primary decay products before Nd are element Pr (praseodymium) isotopes and the primary products after are element Pm (promethium) isotopes.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Neodymium was discovered by Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, an Austrian chemist, in Vienna in 1885. He separated neodymium, as well as the element praseodymium, from a material known as didymium by means of fractional crystallization of the double ammonium nitrate tetrahydrates from nitric acid, while following the separation by spectroscopic analysis; however, it was not isolated in relatively pure form until 1925. The name neodymium is derived from the Greek words <i>neos</i> (νέος), new, and <i>didymos</i> (διδύμος), twin.</p>\n<p>Double nitrate crystallization was the means of commercial neodymium purification until the 1950s. Lindsay Chemical Division was the first to commercialize large-scale ion-exchange purification of neodymium. Starting in the 1950s, high purity (above 99%) neodymium was primarily obtained through an ion exchange process from monazite, a mineral rich in rare earth elements. The metal itself is obtained through electrolysis of its halide salts. Currently, most neodymium is extracted from bastnäsite, (Ce,La,Nd,Pr)COF, and purified by solvent extraction. Ion-exchange purification is reserved for preparing the highest purities (typically &gt;99.99&nbsp;%). The evolving technology, and improved purity of commercially available neodymium oxide, was reflected in the appearance of neodymium glass that resides in collections today. Early neodymium glasses made in the 1930s have a more reddish or orange tinge than modern versions which are more cleanly purple, due to the difficulties in removing the last traces of praseodymium in the era when fractional crystallization technology had to be relied on.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBastnäsite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Neodymium is never found in nature as the free element, but rather it occurs in ores such as monazite and bastnäsite that contain small amounts of all the rare earth metals. The main mining areas are in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The reserves of neodymium are estimated at about eight million tonnes. Although it belongs to the rare earth metals, neodymium is not rare at all. Its abundance in the Earth crust is about 38&nbsp;mg/kg, which is the second highest among rare-earth elements, following cerium. The world's production of neodymium was about 7,000 tonnes in 2004. The bulk of current production is from China, whose government has recently imposed strategic materials controls on the element, raising some concerns in consuming countries and causing skyrocketing prices of neodymium and other rare-earth metals. As of late 2011, 99 percent pure neodymium was traded in world markets for USD $300 to $350 per kilogram, down from the mid-2011 peak of $500/kg.</p>\n<p>Neodymium is typically 10% to 18% of the rare earth content of commercial deposits of the light rare earth element minerals bastnasite and monazite. With neodymium compounds being the most strongly colored for the trivalent lanthanides, that percentage of neodymium can occasionally dominate the coloration of rare earth minerals—when competing chromophores are absent. It usually gives a pink coloration. Outstanding examples of this include monazite crystals from the tin deposits in Llallagua, Bolivia, ancylite from Mont Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, or lanthanite from the Saucon Valley, Pennsylvania. As with neodymium glasses, such minerals change their colors under the differing lighting conditions. The absorption bands of neodymium interact with the visible emission spectrum of mercury vapor, with the unfiltered shortwave UV light causing neodymium-containing minerals to reflect a distinctive green color. This can be observed with monazite-containing sands or bastnasite-containing ore.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Neodymium has an unusually large specific heat capacity at liquid-helium temperatures, so is useful in cryocoolers</li>\n<li>Probably because of similarities to Ca, Nd has been reported to promote plant growth. Rare earth element compounds are frequently used in China as fertilizer.</li>\n<li>Samarium-neodymium dating is useful for determining the age relationships of rocks and meteorites.</li>\n<li>Size and strength of volcanic eruption can be predicted by scanning for neodymium isotopes. Small and large volcanic eruptions produce lava with different neodymium isotope composition. From the composition of isotopes, scientists predict how big the coming eruption will be, and use this information to warn residents of the intensity of the eruption.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Magnets</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNeodymium magnet on a bracket from a hard drive</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Neodymium magnets (actually an alloy, NdFeB) are the strongest permanent magnets known. A neodymium magnet of a few grams can lift a thousand times its own weight. These magnets are cheaper, lighter, and stronger than samarium-cobalt magnets. However, they are not superior in every aspect, as neodymium-based magnets lose their magnetism at high temperatures and tend to rust, while samarium-cobalt magnets do not.</p>\n<p>Neodymium magnets appear in products such as microphones, professional loudspeakers, in-ear headphones, guitar and bass guitar pick-ups and computer hard disks where low mass, small volume, or strong magnetic fields are required. Neodymium magnet electric motors have also been responsible for the development of purely electrical model aircraft within the first decade of the 21st century, to the point that these are displacing internal combustion powered models internationally. Likewise, due to this high magnetic capacity per weight, neodymium is used in the electric motors of hybrid and electric automobiles, and in the electricity generators of some designs of commercial wind turbines (only wind turbines with \"permanent magnet\" generators use neodymium). For example, drive electric motors of each Toyota Prius require one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of neodymium per vehicle.</p>\n<h3>Neodymium doped lasers</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNeodymium ions in various types of ionic crystals, and also in glasses, act as a laser gain medium, typically emitting 1064 nm light from a particular atomic transition in the neodymium ion, after being \"pumped\" into excitation from an external source</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNeodymium doped glass slabs used in extremely powerful lasers for inertial confinement fusion.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Certain transparent materials with a small concentration of neodymium ions can be used in lasers as gain media for infrared wavelengths (1054–1064&nbsp;nm), e.g. Nd:YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet), Nd:YLF (yttrium lithium fluoride), Nd:YVO (yttrium orthovanadate), and Nd:glass. Neodymium-doped crystals (typically Nd:YVO) generate high-powered infrared laser beams which are converted to green laser light in commercial DPSS hand-held lasers and laser pointers.</p>\n<p>The current laser at the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), the HELEN (High Energy Laser Embodying Neodymium) 1-terawatt neodymium-glass laser, can access the midpoints of pressure and temperature regions and is used to acquire data for modeling on how density, temperature and pressure interact inside warheads. HELEN can create plasmas of around 10 K, from which opacity and transmission of radiation are measured.</p>\n<p>Neodymium glass solid-state lasers are used in extremely high power (terawatt scale), high energy (megajoules) multiple beam systems for inertial confinement fusion. Nd:glass lasers are usually frequency tripled to the third harmonic at 351&nbsp;nm in laser fusion devices.</p>\n<h3>Neodymium glass for other applications</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA neodymium glass light bulb, with the base and inner coating removed, under two different types of light: fluorescent on the left, and incandescent on the right.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNeodymium-colored glass</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Neodymium glass (Nd:glass) is produced by the inclusion of neodymium oxide (NdO) in the glass melt. Usually in daylight or incandescent light neodymium glass appears lavender, but it appears pale blue under fluorescent lighting. Neodymium may be used to color glass in delicate shades ranging from pure violet through wine-red and warm gray.</p>\n<p>The first commercial use of purified neodymium was in glass coloration, starting with experiments by Leo Moser in November 1927. The resulting \"Alexandrite\" glass remains a signature color of the Moser glassworks to this day. Neodymium glass was widely emulated in the early 1930s by American glasshouses, most notably Heisey, Fostoria (\"wisteria\"), Cambridge (\"heatherbloom\"), and Steuben (\"wisteria\"), and elsewhere (e.g. Lalique, in France, or Murano). Tiffin's \"twilight\" remained in production from about 1950 to 1980. Current sources include glassmakers in the Czech Republic, the United States, and China.</p>\n<p>The sharp absorption bands of neodymium cause the glass color to change under different lighting conditions, being reddish-purple under daylight or yellow incandescent light, but blue under white fluorescent lighting, or greenish under trichromatic lighting. This color-change phenomenon is highly prized by collectors. In combination with gold or selenium, beautiful red colors result. Since neodymium coloration depends upon \"forbidden\" f-f transitions deep within the atom, there is relatively little influence on the color from the chemical environment, so the color is impervious to the thermal history of the glass. However, for the best color, iron-containing impurities need to be minimized in the silica used to make the glass. The same forbidden nature of the f-f transitions makes rare-earth colorants less intense than those provided by most d-transition elements, so more has to be used in a glass to achieve the desired color intensity. The original Moser recipe used about 5% of neodymium oxide in the glass melt, a sufficient quantity such that Moser referred to these as being \"rare earth doped\" glasses. Being a strong base, that level of neodymium would have affected the melting properties of the glass, and the lime content of the glass might have had to be adjusted accordingly.</p>\n<p>Light transmitted through neodymium glasses shows unusually sharp absorption bands; the glass is used in astronomical work to produce sharp bands by which spectral lines may be calibrated. Neodymium is also used to remove the green color caused by iron contaminants from glass. Neodymium is a component of \"didymium\" (referring to mixture of salts of neodymium and praseodymium) used for coloring glass to make welder's and glass-blower's goggles; the sharp absorption bands obliterate the strong sodium emission at 589&nbsp;nm.</p>\n<p>Neodymium and didymium glass are used in color-enhancing filters in indoor photography, particularly in filtering out the yellow hues from incandescent lighting.</p>\n<p>Similarly, neodymium glass is becoming widely used more directly in incandescent light bulbs. These lamps contain neodymium in the glass to filter out yellow light, resulting in a whiter light which is more like sunlight.</p>\n<p>Neodymium has been patented for use in automobile rear-view mirrors, to reduce the glare at night.</p>\n<p>Similar to its use in glasses, neodymium salts are used as a colorant for enamels.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Neodymium metal dust is a combustion and explosion hazard. Neodymium compounds, as with all rare earth metals, are of low to moderate toxicity; however its toxicity has not been thoroughly investigated. Neodymium dust and salts are very irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes, and moderately irritating to skin. Breathing the dust can cause lung embolisms, and accumulated exposure damages the liver. Neodymium also acts as an anticoagulant, especially when given intravenously.</p>\n<p>Neodymium magnets have been tested for medical uses such as magnetic braces and bone repair, but biocompatibility issues have prevented widespread application. Commercially available magnets made from neodymium are exceptionally strong, and can attract each other from large distances. If not handled carefully, they come together very quickly and forcefully, causing injuries. For example, there is at least one documented case of a person losing a fingertip when two magnets he was using snapped together from 50&nbsp;cm away.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Gschneidner, K.

  "title": "Promethium",
  "html": "<div>For other uses, see Promethium (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Promethium</b>, originally <b>prometheum</b>, is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Pm</b> and atomic number 61. All of its isotopes are radioactive; it is one of only two such elements that are followed in the periodic table by elements with stable forms, a distinction shared with technetium. Chemically, promethium is a lanthanide, which forms salts when combined with other elements. Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3; however, a few +2 compounds may exist.</p>\n<p>In 1902, Bohuslav Brauner suggested there was an element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements neodymium (60) and samarium (62); this was confirmed in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known, found there was no element with atomic number 61. In 1926, an Italian and an American group claimed to have isolated a sample of element 61; both \"discoveries\" were soon proven to be false. In 1938, during a nuclear experiment conducted at Ohio State University, a few radioactive nuclides were produced that certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium, but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced, and the discovery was not generally recognized. Promethium was first produced and characterized at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1945 by the separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in a graphite reactor. The discoverers proposed the name \"prometheum\" (the spelling was subsequently changed), derived from Prometheus, the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans, to symbolize \"both the daring and the possible misuse of mankind's intellect.\" However, a sample of the metal was made only in 1963.</p>\n<p>There are two possible sources for natural promethium: rare decays of natural europium-151 (producing promethium-147), and uranium (various isotopes). Practical applications exist only for chemical compounds of promethium-147, which are used in luminous paint, atomic batteries and thickness measurement devices, even though promethium-145 is the most stable promethium isotope. Since natural promethium is exceedingly scarce, the element is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium-235 (enriched uranium) with thermal neutrons to produce promethium-147.</p>\n\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>A promethium atom has 61 electrons, arranged in the configuration [Xe]4f6s. In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons and one of the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The element's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.</p>\n<p>Many properties of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, the first three ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and lower than those of samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less those of neodymium.</p>\n<p>Promethium has a double hexagonal close packed (dhcp) structure and a hardness of 63&nbsp;kg/mm. This low-temperature alpha form converts into a beta, body-centered cubic (bcc) phase upon heating to 890 °C.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties and compounds</h3>\n<p>Promethium belongs to the cerium group of lanthanides and is chemically very similar to the neighboring elements. Because of its instability, chemical studies of promethium are incomplete. Even though a few compounds have been synthesized, they are not fully studied; in general, they tend to be pink or red in color. Treatment of acidic solutions containing Pm ions with ammonia results in a gelatinous light-brown sediment of hydroxide, Pm(OH), which is insoluble in water. When dissolved in hydrochloric acid, a water-soluble yellow salt, PmCl, is produced; similarly, when dissolved in nitric acid, a nitrate results, Pm(NO). The latter is also well-soluble; when dried, it forms pink crystals, similar to Nd(NO). The electron configuration for Pm is [Xe] 4f, and the color of the ion is pink. The ground state term symbol is I. The sulfate is slightly soluble, like the other cerium group sulfates. Cell parameters have been calculated for its octahydrate; they lead to conclusion that the density of Pm(SO)·8&nbsp;HO is 2.86 g/cm. The oxalate, Pm(CO)·10&nbsp;HO, has the lowest solubility of all lanthanide oxalates.</p>\n<p>Unlike the nitrate, the oxide is similar to the corresponding samarium salt and not the neodymium salt. As-synthesized, e.g. by heating the oxalate, it is a white or lavender-colored powder with disordered structure. This powder crystallizes in a cubic lattice upon heating to 600 °C. Further annealing at 800 °C and then at 1750 °C irreversibly transforms it to a monoclinic and hexagonal phases, respectively, and the last two phases can be interconverted by adjusting the annealing time and temperature.</p>\n\n<p>Promethium forms only one stable oxidation state, +3, in the form of ions; this is in line with other lanthanides. According to its position in the periodic table, the element cannot be expected to form stable +4 or +2 oxidation states; treating chemical compounds containing Pm ions with strong oxidizing or reducing agents showed that the ion is not easily oxidized or reduced.</p>\n\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of promethium</div>\n<p>Promethium is the only lanthanide and one of only two elements among the first 82 that has no stable (or even long-lived) isotopes; this is a result of a rarely occurring effect of the liquid drop model and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes; it is also the least stable element of the first 84. The primary decay products are neodymium and samarium isotopes (promethium-146 decays to both, the lighter isotopes generally to neodymium via positron decay and electron capture, and the heavier isotopes to samarium via beta decay). Promethium nuclear isomers may decay to other promethium isotopes and one isotope (Pm) has a very rare alpha decay mode to praseodymium.</p>\n<p>The most stable isotope of the element is promethium-145, which has a specific activity of 940&nbsp;Ci (35&nbsp;TBq)/g and a half-life of 17.7 years via electron capture. Because it has 84 neutrons (two more than 82, which is a magic number which corresponds to a stable neutron configuration), it may emit an alpha particle (which has 2 neutrons) to form praseodymium-141 with 82 neutrons. Thus it is the only promethium isotope with an experimentally observed alpha decay. Its partial half-life for alpha decay is about 6.3×10&nbsp;years, and the relative probability for a Pm nucleus to decay in this way is 2.8×10%. Several other Pm isotopes (Pm, Pm, Pm etc.) also have a positive energy release for alpha decay; their alpha decays are predicted to occur but have not been observed.</p>\n<p>The element also has 18 nuclear isomers, with mass numbers of 133 to 142, 144, 148, 149, 152, and 154 (some mass numbers have more than one isomer). The most stable of them is promethium-148m, with a half-life of 43.1&nbsp;days; this is longer than the half-lives of the ground states of all promethium isotopes, except only for promethium-143 to 147 (note that promethium-148m has a longer half-life than the ground state, promethium-148).</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPitchblende, a uranium ore and the host for most of Earth's promethium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 1934, Willard Libby found weak beta activity in pure neodymium, which was attributed to a half-life over 10&nbsp;years. Almost 20 years later, it was claimed that the element occurs in natural neodymium in equilibrium in quantities below 10 grams of promethium per one gram of neodymium. However, these observations were disproved by newer investigations, because for all seven naturally occurring neodymium isotopes, any single beta decays (which can produce promethium nuclides) are forbidden by energy conservation. In particular, careful measurements of atomic masses show that the mass difference Nd-Pm is negative (−87 keV), which absolutely prevents the single beta decay of Nd to Pm.</p>\n<p>Both isotopes of natural europium have larger mass excesses than sums of those of their potential alpha daughters plus that of an alpha particle; therefore, they (stable in practice) may alpha decay. Research at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso showed that europium-151 experimentally decays to promethium-147 with the half-life of 5×10&nbsp;years. It has been shown that europium is \"responsible\" for about 12&nbsp;grams of promethium in the Earth's crust. Alpha decays for europium-153 have not been found yet, and its theoretically calculated half-life is so high (due to low energy of decay) that this process will probably never be observed.</p>\n<p>Finally, promethium can be formed in nature as a product of spontaneous fission of uranium-238. Only trace amounts can be found in naturally occurring ores: a sample of pitchblende has been found to contain promethium at a concentration of four parts per quintillion (10) by mass. Uranium is thus \"responsible\" for 560&nbsp;g promethium in Earth's crust.</p>\n<p>Promethium has also been identified in the spectrum of the star HR 465 in Andromeda; it also has been found in HD 101065 (Przybylski's star) and HD 965. Because of the short half-life of promethium isotopes, they should be formed near the surface of those stars.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Searches for element 61</h3>\n<p>In 1902, Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner found out that the difference between neodymium and samarium is the largest of all neighboring lanthanides pairs; as a conclusion, he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them. This prediction was supported in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having discovered that atomic number was an experimentally measurable property of elements, found a few atomic numbers had no element to correspond: the gaps were 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87. With the knowledge of a gap in the periodic table several groups started to search for the predicted element among other rare earths in the natural environment.</p>\n<p>The first claim of a discovery was published by Luigi Rolla and Lorenzo Fernandes of Florence, Italy. After separating a mixture of a few rare earth elements nitrate concentrate from the Brazilian mineral monazite by fractionated crystallization, they yielded a solution containing mostly samarium. This solution gave x-ray spectra attributed to samarium and element 61. In honor of their city, they named element 61 \"florentium.\" The results were published in 1926, but the scientists claimed that the experiments were done in 1924. Also in 1926, a group of scientists from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Smith Hopkins and Len Yntema published the discovery of element 61. They named it \"illinium,\" after the university. Both of these reported discoveries were shown to be erroneous because the spectrum line that \"corresponded\" to element 61 was identical to that of didymium; the lines thought to belong to element 61 turned out to belong to a few impurities (barium, chromium, and platinum).</p>\n<p>In 1934, Josef Mattauch finally formulated the isobar rule. One of the indirect consequences of was this rule was that element 61 was unable to form stable isotopes. In 1938, a nuclear experiment was conducted by H. B. Law <i>et al.</i> at Ohio State University. The nuclides produced certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium, and the name \"cyclonium\" was proposed, but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced and the discovery not largely recognized.</p>\n<h3>Discovery and synthesis of promethium metal</h3>\n<p>Promethium was first produced and characterized at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Clinton Laboratories at that time) in 1945 by Jacob A. Marinsky, Lawrence E. Glendenin and Charles D. Coryell by separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in the graphite reactor; however, being too busy with military-related research during World War II, they did not announce their discovery until 1947. The original proposed name was \"clintonium\", after the laboratory where the work was conducted; however, the name \"prometheum\" was suggested by Grace Mary Coryell, the wife of one of the discoverers. It is derived from Prometheus, the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans and symbolizes \"both the daring and the possible misuse of the mankind intellect.\" The spelling was then changed to \"promethium,\" as this was in closer in accordance with other metals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Jacob A. Marinsky</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Lawrence E. Glendenin</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Charles D. Coryell</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 1963, promethium(III) fluoride was used to make promethium metal. Provisionally purified from impurities of samarium, neodymium, and americium, it was put into a tantalum crucible which was located in another tantalum crucible; the outer crucible contained lithium metal (10 times excess compared to promethium). After creating a vacuum, the chemicals were mixed to produce promethium metal:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>PmF + 3&nbsp;Li → Pm + 3&nbsp;LiF</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The promethium sample produced was used to measure a few of the metal's properties, such as its melting point.</p>\n<p>In 1963, ion-exchange methods were used at ORNL to prepare about ten grams of promethium from nuclear reactor fuel processing wastes.</p>\n<p>Today, promethium is still recovered from the byproducts of uranium fission; it can also be produced by bombarding Nd with neutrons, turning it into Nd which decays into Pm through beta decay with a half-life of 11 days.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>The production methods for different isotopes vary, and only that for promethium-147 is given because it is the only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 is produced in large quantities (compared to other isotopes) by bombarding uranium-235 with thermal neutrons. The output is relatively high, at 2.6% of the total product. Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium-146 with thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator. Another method is to bombard uranium-238 with fast neutrons to cause fast fission, which, among multiple reaction products, creates promethium-147.</p>\n<p>As early as the 1960s, Oak Ridge National Laboratory could produce 650&nbsp;grams of promethium per year and was the world's only large-volume synthesis facility. Gram-scale production of promethium has been discontinued in the U.S. in the early 1980s, but will possibly be resumed after 2010 at the High Flux Isotope Reactor. Currently, Russia is the only country producing promethium-147 on a relatively large scale.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPromethium(III) chloride being used as a light source for signals in a heat button</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Most promethium is used only for research purposes, except for promethium-147, which can be found outside laboratories. It is obtained as the oxide or chloride, in milligram quantities. This isotope does not emit gamma rays, and its radiation has a relatively small penetration depth in matter and a relatively long half-life.</p>\n<p>Some signal lights use a luminous paint, containing a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope does not cause aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 was used for the purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for safety reasons.</p>\n<p>In atomic batteries, the beta particles emitted by promethium-147 are converted into electric current by sandwiching a small Pm source between two semiconductor plates. These batteries have a useful lifetime of about five years. The first promethium-based battery was assembled in 1964 and generated \"a few milliwatts of power from a volume of about 2 cubic inches, including shielding\".</p>\n<p>Promethium is also used to measure the thickness of materials by evaluating the amount of radiation from a promethium source that passes through the sample. It has possible future uses in portable X-ray sources, and as auxiliary heat or power sources for space probes and satellites (although the alpha emitter plutonium-238 has become standard for most space-exploration-related uses).</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>The element, like other lanthanides, has no biological role. Promethium-147 can emit X-rays during its beta decay, which are dangerous for all lifeforms. Interactions with tiny quantities of promethium-147 are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed. In general, gloves, footwear covers, safety glasses, and an outer layer of easily removed protective clothing should be used.</p>\n<p>It is not known what human organs are affected by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous to the environment and humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^     Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

  "title": "Samarium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Samarium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Sm</b> and atomic number&nbsp;62. It is a moderately hard silvery metal that readily oxidizes in air. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, samarium usually assumes the oxidation state +3. Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide. The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis. Samarium has no significant biological role and is only slightly toxic.</p>\n<p>Samarium was discovered in 1879 by the French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thereby became the first person to have a chemical element named after him, albeit indirectly. Although classified as a rare earth element, samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is more common than such metals as tin. Samarium occurs with concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite, gadolinite, samarskite, monazite and bastnäsite, the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production.</p>\n<p>The major commercial application of samarium is in samarium-cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization second only to neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above 700&nbsp;°C, without losing their magnetic properties. The radioactive isotope samarium-153 is the major component of the drug samarium (Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells in the treatment of lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and is therefore added to the control rods of nuclear reactors. It is also formed as a decay product during the reactor operation and is one of the important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other applications of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and an X-ray laser.</p>\n\n<h2>Physical properties</h2>\n<p>Samarium is a rare earth metal having the hardness and density similar to those of zinc. With the boiling point of 1794&nbsp;°C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, samarium normally assumes a trigonal structure (α form). Upon heating to 731&nbsp;°C, its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonal close-packed (<i>hcp</i>), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922&nbsp;°C transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (<i>bcc</i>) phase. Heating to 300&nbsp;°C combined with compression to 40 kbar results in a double-hexagonal close-packed structure (<i>dhcp</i>). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900 kbar. In one study, the <i>dhcp</i> phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700&nbsp;°C, confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the <i>hcp</i> or <i>dhcp</i> phases at ambient conditions.</p>\n<p>Samarium (and its sesquioxide) are paramagnetic at room temperature. Their corresponding effective magnetic moments, below 2µ, are the 3rd lowest among the lanthanides (and their oxides) after lanthanum and lutetium. The metal transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 14.8 K. Individual samarium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules. They can also be doped between the C molecules in the fullerene solid, rendering it superconductive at temperatures below 8 K. Samarium doping of iron-based superconductors – the most recent class of high-temperature superconductors – allows to enhance their transition temperature to 56 K, which is the highest value achieved so far in this series.</p>\n<h2>Chemical properties</h2>\n<p>Freshly prepared samarium has a silvery luster. In air, it slowly oxidizes at room temperature and spontaneously ignites at 150&nbsp;°C. Even when stored under mineral oil, samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish-yellow powder of the oxide-hydroxide mixture at the surface. The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon.</p>\n<p>Samarium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form samarium hydroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Sm (s) + 6 HO (l) → 2 Sm(OH) (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Samarium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the yellow to pale green Sm(III) ions, which exist as [Sm(OH)] complexes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Sm (s) + 3 HSO (aq) → 2 Sm (aq) + 3 SO2−\n4 (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Samarium is one of the few lanthanides that exhibit the oxidation state +2. The Sm ions are blood-red in solutions.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also: Category:Samarium compounds</div>\n\n<h3>Oxides</h3>\n<p>The most stable oxide of samarium is the sesquioxide SmO. As many other samarium compounds, it exists in several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of SmO is rather high (2345&nbsp;°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. The SmO crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from the SmO powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal SmO to 1900&nbsp;°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic SmO has also been described.</p>\n<p>Samarium is one of the few lanthanides that form a monoxide, SmO. This lustrous golden-yellow compound was obtained by reducing SmO with samarium metal at elevated temperature (1000&nbsp;°C) and pressure above 50 kbar; lowering the pressure resulted in an incomplete reaction. SmO has the cubic rock-salt lattice structure.</p>\n<h3>Chalcogenides</h3>\n<div>See also: Samarium monochalcogenides</div>\n<p>Samarium forms trivalent sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt crystal structure are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state at room temperature upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30 kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5 kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, but there is a sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<p>Samarium metal reacts with all the halogens X = F, Cl, Br or I, forming trihalides:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Sm (s) + 3 X (g) → 2 SmX (s)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Their further reduction with samarium, lithium or sodium metals at elevated temperatures (about 700–900&nbsp;°C) yields dihalides. The diiodide can also be prepared by heating SmI, or by reacting the metal with 1,2-diiodoethane in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at room temperature:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Sm (s) + ICH-CHI → SmI + CH=CH.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In addition to dihalides, the reduction also produces numerous non-stoichiometric samarium halides with a well-defined crystal structure, such as SmF, SmF, SmF, SmBr, SmBr and SmBr.</p>\n<p>As reflected in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e. g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm).</p>\n<h3>Borides</h3>\n<p>Sintering powders of samarium oxide and boron, in vacuum, yields a powder containing several samarium boride phases, and their volume ratio can be controlled through the mixing proportion. The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using arc melting or zone melting techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB (2580&nbsp;°C), SmB (about 2300&nbsp;°C) and SmB (2150&nbsp;°C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240&nbsp;°C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB.</p>\n<h4>Samarium hexaboride</h4>\n<p>Samarium hexaboride is a typical intermediate-valence compound where samarium is present both as Sm and Sm ions at the ratio 3:7. It belongs to a class of Kondo insulators, that is at high temperatures (above 50 K), its properties are typical of a Kondo metal, with metallic electrical conductivity characterized by strong electron scattering, whereas at low temperatures, it behaves as a non-magnetic insulator with a narrow band gap of about 4–14 meV. The cooling-induced metal-insulator transition in SmB is accompanied by a sharp increase in the thermal conductivity, peaking at about 15 K. The reason for this increase is that electrons themselves do not contribute to the thermal conductivity at low temperatures, which is dominated by phonons, but the decrease in electron concentration reduced the rate of electron-phonon scattering.</p>\n<p>New research seems to show that it may be a Topological insulator.</p>\n<h3>Other inorganic compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSamarium sulfate, Sm(SO)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Samarium carbides are prepared by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere. Samarium monophosphide SmP is a semiconductor with the bandgap of 1.10 eV, the same as in silicon, and high electrical conductivity of n-type. It can be prepared by annealing at 1100&nbsp;°C an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium. Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1&nbsp;°C/min. Similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<p>A large number of crystalline binary compounds are known for samarium and one of the group-4, 5 or 6 element X, where X is Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb or Te, and metallic alloys of samarium form another large group. They are all prepared by annealing mixed powders of the corresponding elements. Many of the resulting compounds are non-stoichiometric and have nominal compositions SmX, where the b/a ratio varies between 0.5 and 3.</p>\n<h3>Organometallic compounds</h3>\n<p>Samarium forms a cyclopentadienide Sm(CH) and its chloroderivatives Sm(CH)Cl and Sm(CH)Cl. They are prepared by reacting samarium trichloride with NaCH in tetrahydrofuran. Contrary to cyclopentadienides of most other lanthanides, in Sm(CH) some CH rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes η or edges η toward another neighboring samarium atom, thereby creating polymeric chains. The chloroderivative Sm(CH)Cl has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as (η-CH)Sm(µ-Cl)(η-CH). There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.</p>\n<p>The (CH) ion in samarium cyclopentadienides can be replaced by the indenide (CH) or cyclooctatetraenide (CH) ring, resulting in Sm(CH) or KSm(η-CH). The latter compound has a similar structure to that of uranocene. There is also a cyclopentadienide of divalent samarium, Sm(CH) – a solid that sublimates at about 85&nbsp;°C. Contrary to ferrocene, the CH rings in Sm(CH) are not parallel but are tilted by 40°.</p>\n<p>Alkyls and aryls of samarium are obtained through a metathesis reaction in tetrahydrofuran or ether:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>SmCl + 3 LiR → SmR + 3 LiCl</dd>\n<dd>Sm(OR) + 3 LiCH(SiMe) → Sm{CH(SiMe)} + 3 LiOR</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Here R is a hydrocarbon group and Me stands for methyl.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of samarium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring samarium has a radioactivity of 128 Bq/g. It is composed of four stable isotopes: Sm, Sm, Sm and Sm, and three extremely long-lived radioisotopes, Sm (half-life t = 1.06×10 years), Sm (7×10 years) and Sm (&gt;2×10 years), with Sm being the most abundant (natural abundance 26.75%). Sm is listed by various sources either as stable or radioactive isotope.</p>\n<p>The long-lived isotopes,Sm, Sm, and Sm, primarily decay by emission of alpha particles to isotopes of neodymium. Lighter unstable isotopes of samarium primarily decay by electron capture to isotopes of promethium, while heavier ones convert through beta decay to isotopes of europium.</p>\n<p>The alpha-decay of Sm to Nd with a half-life of 1.06×10 years serve for samarium-neodymium dating</p>\n<p>The half-lives of Sm and Sm are 90 years and 340 days, respectively. All of the remaining radioisotopes have half-lives that are less than 2 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 48 seconds. Samarium also has five nuclear isomers with the most stable being Sm (half-life 22.6 minutes), Sm (t = 66 seconds) and Sm (t = 10.7 seconds).</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPaul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, the discoverer of samarium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Detection of samarium and related elements was announced by several scientists in the second half of the 19th century; however, most sources give the priority to the French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran. Boisbaudran isolated samarium oxide and/or hydroxide in Paris in 1879 from the mineral samarskite ((Y,Ce,U,Fe)(Nb,Ta,Ti)O) and identified a new element in it via sharp optical absorption lines. The Swiss chemist Marc Delafontaine announced a new element <i>decipium</i> (from Latin: decipiens meaning \"deceptive, misleading\") in 1878, but later in 1880–1881 demonstrated that it was a mixture of several elements, one being identical to the Boisbaudran's samarium. Although samarskite was first found in the remote Russian region of Urals, by the late 1870s its deposits had been located in other places making the mineral available to many researchers. In particular, it was found that the samarium isolated by Boisbaudran was also impure and contained comparable amount of europium. The pure element was produced only in 1901 by Eugène-Anatole Demarçay.</p>\n<p>Boisbaudran named his element <i>samaria</i> after the mineral samarskite, which in turn honored Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870). Samarsky-Bykhovets, as the Chief of Staff of the Russian Corps of Mining Engineers, had granted access for two German mineralogists, the brothers Gustav Rose and Heinrich Rose, to study the mineral samples from the Urals. In this sense samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a person. Later the name <i>samaria</i> used by Boisbaudran was transformed into <i>samarium</i>, to conform with other element names, and samaria nowadays is sometimes used to refer to samarium oxide, by analogy with yttria, zirconia, alumina, ceria, holmia, etc. The symbol <i>Sm</i> was suggested for samarium; however an alternative <i>Sa</i> was frequently used instead until the 1920s.</p>\n<p>Prior to the advent of ion-exchange separation technology in the 1950s, samarium had no commercial uses in pure form. However, a by-product of the fractional crystallization purification of neodymium was a mixture of samarium and gadolinium that acquired the name of \"Lindsay Mix\" after the company that made it. This material is thought to have been used for nuclear control rods in some of the early nuclear reactors. Nowadays, a similar commodity product has the name \"samarium-europium-gadolinium\" (SEG) concentrate. It is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed lanthanides isolated from bastnäsite (or monazite). Since the heavier lanthanides have the greater affinity for the solvent used, they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent. Not all rare-earth producers who process bastnäsite do so on a large enough scale to continue onward with the separation of the components of SEG, which typically makes up only one or two percent of the original ore. Such producers will therefore be making SEG with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors. In this manner, the valuable europium content of the ore is rescued for use in phosphor manufacture. Samarium purification follows the removal of the europium. As of 2012, being in oversupply, samarium oxide is less expensive on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSamarskite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>With the average concentration of about 8 parts per million (ppm), samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It is the fifth most abundant lanthanide and is more common than such element as tin. Samarium concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23 ppm, and oceans contain about 0.5–0.8 parts per trillion. Distribution of samarium in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous: in sandy soils, samarium concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them, and this ratio can exceed 1,000 in clays.</p>\n<p>Samarium is not found free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is contained in many minerals, including monazite, bastnäsite, cerite, gadolinite and samarskite; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it is followed by the US (about 5,000 tonnes) and India (2,700 tonnes). Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30 USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium – has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through ion exchange processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1794&nbsp;°C) and lanthanum (b.p.&nbsp;3464&nbsp;°C).</p>\n<p>Samarium-151 is produced in nuclear fission of uranium with the yield of about 0.4% of the total number of fission events. It is also synthesized upon neutron capture by samarium-149, which is added to the control rods of nuclear reactors. Consequently, samarium-151 is present in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBarbier reaction using SmI</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>One of the most important applications of samarium is in samarium-cobalt magnets, which have a nominal composition of SmCo or SmCo. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of neodymium magnets. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700&nbsp;°C (cf. 300–400&nbsp;°C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft Solar Challenger and in the Samarium Cobalt Noiseless electric guitar and bass pickups.</p>\n<p>Another important application of samarium and its compounds is as catalyst and chemical reagent. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), as well as the dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate (Sm(OTf), that is Sm(CFSO)) is one of the most efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in the desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.</p>\n<p>In its usual oxidized form, samarium is added to ceramics and glasses where it increases absorption of infrared light. As a (minor) part of mischmetal, samarium is found in \"flint\" ignition device of many lighters and torches.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChemical structure of Sm-EDTMP</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Radioactive samarium-153 is a beta emitter with a half-life of 46.3 hours. It is used to kill cancer cells in the treatment of lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including samarium (Sm) lexidronam and its trade name is Quadramet.</p>\n<p>Samarium-149 has high cross-section for neutron capture (41,000 barns) and is therefore used in the control rods of nuclear reactors. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption – most of the fusion and decay products of samarium-149 are other isotopes of samarium that are also good neutron absorbers. For example, the cross sections of samarium-151 is 15,000 barns, it is on the order of hundred barns for samarium-150, 152, 153, and is 6,800 barns for natural (mixed-isotope) samarium. Among the decay products in a nuclear reactor, samarium-149 is regarded as the second most important for the reactor design and operation after xenon-135.</p>\n<h3>Non-commercial and potential applications</h3>\n<p>Samarium-doped calcium fluoride crystals were used as an active medium in one of the first solid-state lasers designed and constructed by Peter Sorokin (co-inventor of the dye laser) and Mirek Stevenson at IBM research labs in early 1961. This samarium laser emitted pulses of red light at 708.5&nbsp;nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and thus did not find practical applications.</p>\n<p>Another samarium-based laser became the first saturated X-ray laser operating at wavelengths shorter than 10 nanometers. It provided 50-picosecond pulses at 7.3 and 6.8&nbsp;nm suitable for applications in holography, high-resolution microscopy of biological specimens, deflectometry, interferometry and radiography of dense plasmas related to confinement fusion and astrophysics. Saturated operation meant that the maximum possible power was extracted from the lasing medium, resulting in the high peak energy of 0.3 mJ. The active medium was samarium plasma produced by irradiating samarium-coated glass with a pulsed infrared Nd-glass laser (wavelength ~1.05&nbsp;µm).</p>\n<p>The change in electrical resistivity in samarium monochalcogenides can be used in a pressure sensor or in a memory device triggered between a low-resistance and high-resistance state by external pressure, and such devices are being developed commercially. Samarium monosulfide also generates electric voltage upon moderate heating to about 150&nbsp;°C that can be applied in thermoelectric power converters.</p>\n<p>The analysis of relative concentrations of samarium and neodymium isotopes Sm, Nd and Nd allows the determination of the age and origin of rocks and meteorites in samarium-neodymium dating. Both elements are lanthanides and have very similar physical and chemical properties. Therefore, Sm-Nd dating is either insensitive to partitioning of the marker elements during various geological processes, or such partitioning can well be understood and modeled from the ionic radii of the involved elements.</p>\n<h2>Health issues</h2>\n<p>Samarium metal has no biological role in human body. Its salts stimulate metabolism, but it is unclear whether this is the effect of samarium or other lanthanides present with it. The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50 micrograms, mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8 micrograms per liter being dissolved in the blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and therefore is normally not a part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic.</p>\n<p>When ingested, only about 0.05% of samarium salts is absorbed into the bloodstream and the remainder is excreted. From the blood, about 45% goes to the liver and 45% is deposited on the surface of the bones where it remains for about 10 years; the balance 10% is excreted.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^     Shi, N; Fort, D (1985). \"Preparation of samarium in the double hexagonal close packed form\".

  "title": "Europium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Europium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Eu</b> and atomic number 63. It is named after the continent Europe. It is a moderately hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the oxidation state +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common: all europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAbout 300 g of dendritic sublimated 99.998% pure europium handled in a glove box</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOxidized europium, coated with yellow europium(II) carbonate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Europium is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of lead. It crystallizes in a body-centered cubic lattice. Some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half-filled electron shell. Europium has the second lowest melting point and the lowest density of all lanthanides.</p>\n<p>Europium becomes a superconductor when it is cooled below 1.8 K and compressed to above 80 GPa. This is because europium is divalent in the metallic state, and is converted into the trivalent state by the applied pressure. In the divalent state, the strong local magnetic moment (J = /) suppresses the superconductivity, which is induced by eliminating this local moment (J = 0 in Eu).</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Europium is the most reactive rare earth element. It rapidly oxidizes in air, so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter-sized sample occurs within several days. Its reactivity with water is comparable to that of calcium, and the reaction is</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Eu + 6 HO → 2 Eu(OH) + 3 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Because of the high reactivity, samples of solid europium rarely have the shiny appearance of the fresh metal, even when coated with a protective layer of mineral oil. Europium ignites in air at 150 to 180 °C to form europium(III) oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Eu + 3 O → 2 EuO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Europium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form pale pink solutions of the hydrated Eu(III), which exist as a nonahydrate:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Eu + 3 HSO + 18 HO → 2 [Eu(HO)] + 3 SO2−\n4 + 3 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4>Eu(II) vs. Eu(III)</h4>\n<p>Although usually trivalent, europium readily forms divalent compounds. This behavior is unusual to most lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 state has an electron configuration 4<i>f</i> because the half-filled <i>f</i>-shell gives more stability. In terms of size and coordination number, europium(II) and barium(II) are similar. For example, the sulfates of both barium and europium(II) are also highly insoluble in water. Divalent europium is a mild reducing agent, oxidizing in air to form Eu(III) compounds. In anaerobic, and particularly geothermal conditions, the divalent form is sufficiently stable that it tends to be incorporated into minerals of calcium and the other alkaline earths. This ion-exchange process is the basis of the \"negative europium anomaly\", the low europium content in many lanthanide minerals such as monazite, relative to the chondritic abundance. Bastnäsite tends to show less of a negative europium anomaly than does monazite, and hence is the major source of europium today. The development of easy methods to separate europium from the other trivalent lanthanides made europium accessible even when present in low concentration, as it usually is.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of europium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring europium is composed of 2 isotopes, Eu and Eu, with Eu being the most abundant (52.2% natural abundance). While Eu is stable, Eu was recently found to be unstable to alpha decay with half-life of 5+11\n−3×10&nbsp;years, giving about 1 alpha decay per two minutes in every kilogram of natural europium. This value is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. Besides the natural radioisotope Eu, 35 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being Eu with a half-life of 36.9 years, Eu with a half-life of 13.516 years, and Eu with a half-life of 8.593 years. All the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than 4.7612 years, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 12.2 seconds. This element also has 8 meta states, with the most stable being Eu (<i>T</i>=12.8 hours), Eu (<i>T</i>=9.3116 hours) and Eu (<i>T</i>=96 minutes).</p>\n<p>The primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than Eu is electron capture, and the primary mode for heavier isotopes is beta minus decay. The primary decay products before Eu are isotopes of samarium (Sm) and the primary products after are isotopes of gadolinium (Gd).</p>\n<h4>Europium as a nuclear fission product</h4>\n\n\n<p>Europium is produced by nuclear fission, but the fission product yields of europium isotopes are low near the top of the mass range for fission products.</p>\n<p>Like other lanthanides, many isotopes, especially isotopes with odd mass numbers and neutron-poor isotopes like Eu, have high cross sections for neutron capture, often high enough to be neutron poisons.</p>\n<p>Eu is the beta decay product of samarium-151, but since this has a long decay half-life and short mean time to neutron absorption, most Sm instead ends up as Sm.</p>\n<p>Eu (half-life 13.516 years) and Eu (half-life 8.593 years) cannot be beta decay products because Sm and Sm are non-radioactive, but Eu is the only long-lived \"shielded\" nuclide, other than Cs, to have a fission yield of more than 2.5 parts per million fissions. A larger amount of Eu is produced by neutron activation of a significant portion of the non-radioactiveEu; however, much of this is further converted to Eu.</p>\n<p>Eu (half-life 4.7612 years) has a fission yield of 330 parts per million (ppm) for uranium-235 and thermal neutrons; most of it is transmuted to non-radioactive and nonabsorptive gadolinium-156 by the end of fuel burnup.</p>\n<p>Overall, europium is overshadowed by caesium-137 and strontium-90 as a radiation hazard, and by samarium and others as a neutron poison.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMonazite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Europium is not found in nature as a free element. Many minerals contain europium, with the most important sources being bastnäsite, monazite, xenotime and loparite.</p>\n<p>Depletion or enrichment of europium in minerals relative to other rare earth elements is known as the europium anomaly. Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form igneous rocks (rocks that cooled from magma or lava). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks.</p>\n<p>Divalent europium (Eu) in small amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite (CaF). The reduction from Eu to Eu is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after, although it was not until much later that europium was determined to be the cause.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Europium is associated with the other rare earth elements and is therefore mined together with them. Separation of the rare earth elements is a step in the later processing. Rare earth elements are found in the minerals bastnäsite, loparite, xenotime, and monazite in mineable quantities. The first two are orthophosphate minerals LnPO (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium), and the third is a fluorocarbonate LnCOF. Monazite also contains thorium and yttrium, which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with zinc, zinc/amalgam, electrolysis or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co-precipitated with barium sulfate. Europium metal is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten EuCl and NaCl (or CaCl) in a graphite cell, which serves as cathode, using graphite as anode. The other product is chlorine gas.</p>\n<p>A few large deposits produce or produced a significant amount of the world production. The Bayan Obo iron ore deposit contains significant amounts of bastnäsite and monazite and is, with an estimated 36 million tonnes of rare earth element oxides, the largest known deposit. The mining operations at the Bayan Obo deposit made China the largest supplier of rare earth elements in the 1990s. Only 0.2% of the rare earth element content is europium. The second large source for rare earth elements between 1965 and its closure in the late 1990s was the Mountain Pass rare earth mine. The bastnäsite mined there is especially rich in the light rare earth elements (La-Gd, Sc, and Y) and contains only 0.1% of europium. Another large source for rare earth elements is the loparite found on the Kola peninsula. It contains besides niobium, tantalum and titanium up to 30% rare earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in Russia.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>See also: Category:Europium compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEuropium sulfate, Eu(SO)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEuropium sulfate fluorescing red under ultraviolet light</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Europium compounds tend to exist trivalent oxidation state under most conditions. Commonly these compounds feature Eu(III) bound by 6-9 oxygenic ligands, typically water. These compounds, the chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, are soluble in water or polar organic solvent. Lipophilic europium complexes often feature acetylacetonate-like ligands, e.g., Eufod.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<p>Europium metal reacts with all the halogens:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Eu + 3 X → 2 EuX (X = F, Cl, Br, I)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This route gives white europium(III) fluoride (EuF), yellow europium(III) chloride (EuCl), gray europium(III) bromide (EuBr), and colorless europium(III) iodide (EuI). Europium also forms the corresponding dihalides: yellow-green europium(II) fluoride (EuF), colorless europium(II) chloride (EuCl), colorless europium(II) bromide (EuBr), and green europium(II) iodide (EuI).</p>\n<h3>Chalcogenides and pnictides</h3>\n<p>Europium forms stable compounds with all of the chalcogens, but the heavier chalcogens (S, Se, and Te) stabilize the lower oxidation state. Three oxides are known: europium(II) oxide (EuO), europium(III) oxide (EuO), and the mixed-valence oxide EuO, consisting of both Eu(II) and Eu(III). Otherwise, the main chalcogenides are europium(II) sulfide (EuS), europium(II) selenide (EuSe) and europium(II) telluride (EuTe): all three of these are black solids. EuS is prepared by sulfiding the oxide at temperatures sufficiently high to decompose the EuO:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>EuO + 3 HS → 2 EuS + 3 HO + S</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The main nitride is europium(III) nitride (EuN).</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Although europium is present in most of the minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements it was not until the late 1800s that the element was isolated. William Crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements and observed spectral lines later assigned to europium.</p>\n<p>Europium was first found by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1890, who obtained basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not accounted for by samarium or gadolinium. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and who was able to isolate it in 1901; he then named it <i>europium</i>.</p>\n<p>When the europium-doped yttrium orthovanadate red phosphor was discovered in the early 1960s, and understood to be about to cause a revolution in the color television industry, there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors, as the typical europium content in monazite is about 0.05%. However, the Molycorp bastnäsite deposit at the Mountain Pass rare earth mine, California, whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0.1%, was about to come on-line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry. Prior to europium, the color-TV red phosphor was very weak, and the other phosphor colors had to be muted, to maintain color balance. With the brilliant red europium phosphor, it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors, and a much brighter color TV picture was the result. Europium has continued in use in the TV industry ever since, and, of course, also in computer monitors. Californian bastnäsite now faces stiff competition from Bayan Obo, China, with an even \"richer\" europium content of 0.2%.</p>\n<p>Frank Spedding, celebrated for his development of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare earth industry in the mid-1950s once related the story of how he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman had turned out to be Herbert Newby McCoy who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEuropium is one of the elements used to make the red color in CRT televisions.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Relative to most other elements, commercial applications for europium are few and rather specialized. Almost invariably, they exploit its phosphorescence, either in the +2 or +3 oxidation state.</p>\n<p>It is a dopant in some types of glass in lasers and other optoelectronic devices. Europium oxide (EuO) is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors. Color TV screens contain between 0.5 and 1&nbsp;g of europium. Whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors, the luminescence of divalent europium depends on the host lattice, but tends to be on the blue side. The two classes of europium-based phosphor (red and blue), combined with the yellow/green terbium phosphors give \"white\" light, the color temperature of which can be varied by altering the proportion or specific composition of the individual phosphors. This phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs. Combining the same three classes is one way to make trichromatic systems in TV and computer screens. Europium is also used in the manufacture of fluorescent glass. One of the more common persistent after-glow phosphors besides copper doped zinc sulfide is europium doped strontium aluminate. Europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug-discovery screens. It is also used in the anti-counterfeiting phosphors in Euro banknotes.</p>\n<p>An application that has almost fallen out of use with the introduction of affordable superconducting magnets is the use of europium complexes, such as Eu(fod), as shift reagents in NMR spectroscopy. Chiral shift reagents, such as Eu(hfc) are still used to determine enantiomeric purity.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>There are no clear indications that europium is particularly toxic compared to other heavy metals. Europium chloride nitrate and oxide have been tested for toxicity: europium chloride shows an acute intraperitoneal LD toxicity of 550&nbsp;mg/kg and the acute oral LD toxicity is 5000&nbsp;mg/kg. Europium nitrate shows a slightly higher intraperitoneal LD toxicity of 320&nbsp;mg/kg, while the oral toxicity is above 5000&nbsp;mg/kg. The metal dust presents a fire and explosion hazard.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Europium anomaly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Lide, D.

  "title": "Gadolinium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Gadolinium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Gd</b> and atomic number&nbsp;64. It is a silvery-white, malleable and ductile rare-earth metal. It is found in nature only in combined (salt) form. Gadolinium was first detected spectroscopically in 1880 by de Marignac who separated its oxide and is credited with its discovery. It is named for gadolinite, one of the minerals in which it was found, in turn named for chemist Johan Gadolin. The metal was isolated by Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1886.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium metal possesses unusual metallurgic properties, to the extent that as little as 1% gadolinium can significantly improve the workability and resistance to high temperature oxidation of iron, chromium, and related alloys. Gadolinium as a metal or salt has exceptionally high absorption of neutrons and therefore is used for shielding in neutron radiography and in nuclear reactors. Like most rare earths, gadolinium forms trivalent ions which have fluorescent properties. Gadolinium(III) salts have therefore been used as green phosphors in various applications.</p>\n<p>The Gadolinium(III) ion occurring in water-soluble salts is quite toxic to mammals. However, chelated Gadolinium(III) compounds are far less toxic because they carry Gadolinium(III) through the kidneys and out of the body before the free ion can be released into tissue. Because of its paramagnetic properties, solutions of chelated organic gadolinium complexes are used as intravenously administered gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents in medical magnetic resonance imaging. However, in a small minority of patients with renal failure, at least four such agents have been associated with development of the rare nodular inflammatory disease nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. This is thought to be due to the gadolinium ion itself, since Gadolinium(III) carrier molecules associated with the disease differ.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA sample of gadolinium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Gadolinium is a silvery-white malleable and ductile rare-earth metal. It crystallizes in hexagonal, close-packed α- form at room temperature, but, when heated to temperatures above 1235&nbsp;°C, it transforms into its β- form, which has a body-centered cubic structure.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium-157 has the highest thermal neutron capture cross-section among any stable nuclides: 259,000 barns. Only xenon-135 has a higher cross section, 2 million barns, but that isotope is unstable.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium is ferromagnetic at temperatures below 20 °C (68&nbsp;°F) and is strongly paramagnetic above this temperature. Gadolinium demonstrates a magnetocaloric effect whereby its temperature increases when it enters a magnetic field and decreases when it leaves the magnetic field. The temperature is lowered to (5 °C (41&nbsp;°F)) for the gadolinium alloy GdEr, and the effect is considerably stronger for the alloy Gd(SiGe), but at a much lower temperature (&lt;85 K (−188.2&nbsp;°C; −306.7&nbsp;°F)). A significant magnetocaloric effect is observed at higher temperatures, up to 300 K, in the Gd(SiGe) compounds.</p>\n<p>Individual gadolinium atoms have been isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules and visualized with transmission electron microscope. Individual Gd atoms and small Gd clusters have also been incorporated into carbon nanotubes.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<div>See also: Category:Gadolinium compounds</div>\n<p>Gadolinium combines with most elements to form Gd(III) derivatives. nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic at elevated temperatures, forming binary compounds.</p>\n<p>Unlike other rare earth elements, metallic gadolinium is relatively stable in dry air. However, it tarnishes quickly in moist air, forming a loosely adhering gadolinium(III) oxide (GdO), which spalls off, exposing more surface to oxidation.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Gd + 3 O → 2 GdO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Gadolinium is a strong reducing agent, which reduces oxides of several metals into their elements. Gadolinium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form gadolinium hydroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Gd + 6 HO → 2 Gd(OH) + 3 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Gadolinium metal is attacked readily by dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the colorless Gd(III) ions, which exist as a [Gd(OH)] complexes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Gd + 3 HSO + 18 HO → 2 [Gd(HO)] + 3 SO + 3 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Gadolinium metal reacts with the halogens (X) at temperature about 200 °C:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Gd + 3 X → 2 GdX</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4>Chemical compounds</h4>\n<p>In the great majority of its compounds, Gd adopts the oxidation state +3. All four trihalides are known. All are white except for the iodide, which is yellow. Most commonly encountered of the halides is gadolinium(III) chloride (GdCl). The oxide dissolves in acids to give the salts, such as gadolinium(III) nitrate.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium(III), like most lanthanide ions, forms complexes with high coordination numbers. This tendency is illustrated by the use of the chelating agent DOTA, an octadentate ligand. Salts of [Gd(DOTA)] are useful in magnetic resonance imaging. A variety of related chelate complexes have been developed, including gadodiamide.</p>\n<p>Reduced gadolinium compounds are known, especially in the solid state. Gadolinium(II) halides are obtained by heating Gd(III) halides in presence of metallic Gd in tantalum containers. Gadolinium also form sesquichloride GdCl, which can be further reduced to GdCl by annealing at 800 °C. This gadolinium(I) chloride forms platelets with layered graphite-like structure.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of gadolinium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring gadolinium is composed of 6 stable isotopes, Gd, Gd, Gd, Gd, Gd and Gd, and 1 radioisotope, Gd, with Gd being the most abundant (24.84% natural abundance). The predicted double beta decay of Gd has never been observed (the only lower limit on its half-life of more than 1.3×10 years has been set experimentally).</p>\n<p>Twenty-nine radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being alpha-decaying Gd (naturally occurring) with a half-life of 1.08×10 years, and Gd with a half-life of 1.79×10 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 74.7 years. The majority of these have half-lives of less than 24.6 seconds. Gadolinium isotopes have 4 metastable isomers, with the most stable being Gd (<i>T</i>=110 seconds), Gd (<i>T</i>=85 seconds) and Gd (<i>T</i>=24.5 seconds).</p>\n<p>Isotopes with atomic masses lower than the most abundant stable isotope, Gd, primarily decay via electron capture to Eu (europium) isotopes. At higher atomic masses, the primary decay mode is beta decay, and the primary products are Tb (terbium) isotopes.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Gadolinium is named from the mineral gadolinite, in turn named for Finnish chemist and geologist Johan Gadolin. In 1880, Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac observed spectroscopic lines due to gadolinium in samples of gadolinite (which actually contains relatively little gadolinium, but enough to show a spectrum), and in the separate mineral cerite. The latter mineral proved to contain far more of the element with the new spectral line, and Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac eventually separated a mineral oxide from cerite which he realized was the oxide of this new element. He named the oxide \"gadolinia.\" Because he realized that \"gadolinia\" was the oxide of a new element, he is credited with discovery of gadolinium. French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran actually carried out the separation of gadolinium metal from gadolinia, in 1886.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGadolinite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Gadolinium is a constituent in many minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite, which are oxides. The metal is too reactive to exist naturally. Ironically, as noted above, the mineral gadolinite actually contains only traces of Gd. The abundance in the earth crust is about 6.2&nbsp;mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, USA, Brazil, Sri Lanka, India and Australia with reserves expected to exceed one million tonnes. World production of pure gadolinium is about 400 tonnes per year.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Gadolinium is produced both from monazite and bastnäsite.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Crushed minerals are extracted with hydrochloric or sulfuric acids, which converts the insoluble oxides into soluble chlorides or sulfates.</li>\n<li>The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates as its hydroxide and is removed.</li>\n<li>The remaining solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by heating.</li>\n<li>The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO.</li>\n<li>The solution is treated with magnesium nitrate to produce a crystallized mixture of double salts of gadolinium, samarium and europium.</li>\n<li>The salts are separated by ion exchange chromatography.</li>\n<li>The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Gadolinium metal is obtained from its oxide or salts by heating with calcium at 1450 °C under argon atmosphere. Sponge gadolinium can be produced by reducing molten GdCl with an appropriate metal at temperatures below 1312 °C (melting point of Gd) in a reduced pressure.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Gadolinium has no large-scale applications but has a variety of specialized uses.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium has the highest neutron cross-section among any stable nuclides: 61,000 barns for Gd and 259,000 barns for Gd. Gd has been used to target tumors in neutron therapy. This element is very effective for use with neutron radiography and in shielding of nuclear reactors. It is used as a secondary, emergency shut-down measure in some nuclear reactors, particularly of the CANDU type. Gadolinium is also used in nuclear marine propulsion systems as a burnable poison.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium also possesses unusual metallurgic properties, with as little as 1% of gadolinium improving the workability and resistance of iron, chromium, and related alloys to high temperatures and oxidation.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium is paramagnetic at room temperature, with a ferromagnetic Curie point of 20 °C. Paramagnetic ions, such as gadolinium, move differently within a magnetic field. This trait makes gadolinium useful for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Solutions of organic gadolinium complexes and gadolinium compounds are used as intravenous MRI contrast agent to enhance images in medical magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) procedures. Magnevist is the most widespread example. Nanotubes packed with gadolinium, dubbed \"gadonanotubes,\" are 40 times more effective than this traditional gadolinium contrast agent. Once injected, gadolinium-based contrast agents accumulate in abnormal tissues of the brain and body. This accumulation provides a greater contrast between normal and abnormal tissues, allowing doctors to better locate uncommon cell growths and tumors.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium as a phosphor is also used in other imaging. In X-ray systems, gadolinium is contained in the phosphor layer, suspended in a polymer matrix at the detector. Terbium-doped gadolinium oxysulfide (GdOS: Tb) at the phosphor layer converts the X-rays released from the source into light. This material emits green light at 540&nbsp;nm due to the presence of Tb, which is very useful for enhancing the imaging quality. The energy conversion of Gd is up to 20%, which means that one-fifth of the X-rays striking the phosphor layer can be converted into light photons. Gadolinium oxyorthosilicate (GdSiO, GSO; usually doped by 0.1–1% of Ce) is a single crystal that is used as a scintillator in medical imaging such as positron emission tomography or for detecting neutrons.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium compounds are also used for making green phosphors for colour TV tubes, and in manufacturing compact discs.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium-153 is produced in a nuclear reactor from elemental europium or enriched gadolinium targets. It has a half-life of 240±10 days and emits gamma radiation with strong peaks at 41 keV and 102 keV. It is used in many quality assurance applications, such as line sources and calibration phantoms, to ensure that nuclear medicine imaging systems operate correctly and produce useful images of radioisotope distribution inside the patient. It is also used as a gamma ray source in X-ray absorption measurements or in bone density gauges for osteoporosis screening, as well as in the Lixiscope portable X-ray imaging system.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium is used for making gadolinium yttrium garnet (Gd:YAlO); it has microwave applications and is used in fabrication of various optical components and as substrate material for magneto–optical films.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium Gallium Garnet (GGG, GdGaO) was used for imitation diamonds and for computer bubble memory.</p>\n<p>Research is being conducted on magnetic refrigeration near room temperature, which could provide significant efficiency and environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration methods. Gadolinium-based materials, such as Gd(SiGe), are currently the most promising materials owing to their high Curie temperature and giant mangetocaloric effect. Pure Gd itself exhibits a large magnetocaloric effect near its Curie temperature of 20 °C, and this has sparked great interest into producing Gd alloys with a larger effect and tunable Curie temperature. In Gd(SiGe), Si and Ge compositions can be varied to adjust the Curie temperature. This technology is still very early in development and significant material improvements still need to be made before it is commercially viable.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Gadolinium has no known native biological role, but its compounds are used as research tools in biomedicine. Gd compounds are components of MRI contrast agents. It is used in various ion channel electrophysiology experiments to block sodium leak channels and stretch activated ion channels.</p>\n<h2>Safety</h2>\n<div>Main articles: MRI contrast agent and Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis</div>\n<p>As a free ion, gadolinium is reported often to be highly toxic, but MRI contrast agents are chelated compounds and are considered safe enough to be used in most persons. Free gadolinium ions toxicity in animals is due to interfering with a number of calcium-ion channel dependent processes. The 50% lethal dose is about 100–200&nbsp;mg/kg. No prolonged toxicities have been reported following low dose exposure to gadolinium ions. Toxicity studies in rodents, however show that chelation of gadolinium (which also improves its solubility) decreases its toxicity with regard to the free ion by at least a factor of 100 (i.e., the lethal dose for the Gd-chelate increases by 100 times). It is believed therefore that clinical toxicity of Gd contrast agents in humans will depend on the strength of the chelating agent; however this research is still not complete. About a dozen different Gd-chelated agents have been approved as MRI contrast agents around the world.</p>\n<p>Gadolinium MRI contrast agents have proved safer than the iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray radiography or computed tomography. Anaphylactoid reactions are rare, occurring in approximately 0.03–0.1%.</p>\n<p>Although gadolinium agents have proved useful for patients with renal impairment, in patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, there is a risk of a rare but serious illnesses, called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) or nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, that has been linked to the use of four gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents. The disease resembles scleromyxedema and to some extent scleroderma. It may occur months after contrast has been injected. Its association with gadolinium and not the carrier molecule is confirmed by its occurrence in from contrast materials in which gadolinium is carried by very different carrier molecules.</p>\n<p>Current guidelines in the United States are that dialysis patients should only receive gadolinium agents where essential and to consider performing an iodinated contrast enhanced CT when feasible. If a contrast enhanced MRI must be performed on a dialysis patient, it is recommended that certain high-risk contrast agents be avoided and that a lower dose be considered. The American College of Radiology recommends that contrast enhanced MRI examinations be performed as closely before dialysis as possible as a precautionary measure, although this has not been proven to reduce the likelihood of developing NSF.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^       Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

  "html": "\n<p><b>Terbium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Tb</b> and atomic number 65. It is a silvery-white rare earth metal that is malleable, ductile and soft enough to be cut with a knife. Terbium is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite, gadolinite, monazite, xenotime and euxenite.</p>\n<p>Terbium is used to dope calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate, materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures. As a component of Terfenol-D (an alloy that expands and contracts when exposed to magnetic fields more than any other alloy), terbium is of use in actuators, in naval sonar systems and in sensors.</p>\n<p>Most of the world's terbium supply is used in green phosphors. Terbium oxide is in fluorescent lamps and TV tubes. Terbium green phosphors are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide \"trichromatic\" lighting technology, a high-efficiency white light used for standard illumination in indoor lighting.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Terbium is a silvery-white rare earth metal that is malleable, ductile and soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is relatively stable in air as compared to other lanthanides. Terbium exists in two crystal allotropes with a transformation temperature of 1289&nbsp;°C between them.</p>\n<p>The terbium(III) cation is brilliantly fluorescent, in a bright lemon-yellow color that is the result of a strong green emission line in combination with other lines in the orange and red. The yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite owes its creamy-yellow fluorescence in part to terbium. Terbium easily oxidizes, and is therefore used in its elemental form specifically for research. Single Tb atoms have been isolated by implanting them into fullerene molecules.</p>\n<p>Terbium has a simple ferromagnetic ordering at temperatures below 219 K. Above 219 K, it turns into a helical antiferromagnetic state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular basal plane layer are parallel, and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers. This unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered paramagnetic state at 230 K.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>The most common valence state of terbium is +3, as in Tb\n2O\n3. The +4 state is known in TbO and TbF. Terbium burns readily to form a mixed terbium(III,IV) oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>8&nbsp;Tb + 7&nbsp;O → 2&nbsp;TbO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In solution, terbium forms only trivalent ions. Terbium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form terbium hydroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2&nbsp;Tb + 6&nbsp;HO → 2 Tb(OH) + 3&nbsp;H↑</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Terbium metal reacts with all the halogens, forming white trihalides:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2&nbsp;Tb + 3&nbsp;X → 2&nbsp;TbX (X = F, Cl, Br, I)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Terbium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the pale pink terbium(III) ions, which exist as a [Tb(OH)] complexes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2&nbsp;Tb (s) + 3&nbsp;HSO → 2&nbsp;Tb + 3&nbsp;SO2−\n4 + 3&nbsp;H↑</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Terbium sulfate, Tb(SO) (top), fluoresces green under ultraviolet light (bottom)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Category:Terbium compounds</div>\n<p>Terbium combines with nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic at elevated temperatures, forming various binary compounds such as TbH, TbH, TbB, TbS, TbSe, TbTe and TbN. In those compounds, Tb mostly exhibit oxidation states +3 and sometimes +2. Terbium(II) halogenides are obtained by annealing Tb(III) halogenides in presence of metallic Tb in tantalum containers. Terbium also forms sesquichloride TbCl, which can be further reduced to TbCl by annealing at 800 °C. This terbium(I) chloride forms platelets with layered graphite-like structure.</p>\n<p>Other compounds include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chlorides: TbCl</li>\n<li>Bromides: TbBr</li>\n<li>Iodides: TbI</li>\n<li>Fluorides: TbF, TbF</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Terbium(IV) fluoride is a strong fluorinating agent, emitting relatively pure atomic fluorine when heated rather than the mixture of fluoride vapors emitted from CoF or CeF.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: isotopes of terbium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring terbium is composed of its only stable isotope, terbium-159; the element is thus called mononuclidic and monoisotopic. 36 radioisotopes have been characterized, with the heaviest being terbium-171 (with atomic mass of 170.95330(86) u) and lightest being terbium-135 (exact mass unknown). The most stable synthetic radioisotope of terbium are terbium-158, with a half-life of 180 years, and terbium-157, with a half-life of 71 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are well less than quarter a year, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half a minute. The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, Tb, is electron capture, which results in production of gadolinium isotopes, and the primary mode after is beta minus decay, resulting in dysprosium isotopes.</p>\n<p>The element also has 27 nuclear isomers, with masses of 141—154, 156, and 158 (not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer). The most stable of them are terbium-156m, with half-life of 24.4 hours and terbium-156m2, with half-life of 22.7 hours; this is longer than half-lives of most ground states of radioactive terbium isotopes, except only those with mass numbers 155—161.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Terbium was discovered in 1843 by Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander, who detected it as an impurity in Yttrium oxide, YO, and named after the village Ytterby in Sweden. It was not isolated in pure form until the recent advent of ion exchange techniques.</p>\n<p>When Mosander first partitioned \"yttria\" into three fractions, \"terbia\" was the fraction that contained the pink color (due to what is now known as erbium), and \"erbia\" was the fraction that was essentially colorless in solution, but gave a brown-tinged oxide. Later workers had difficulty in observing the latter, but the pink fraction was impossible to miss. Arguments went back and forth as to whether \"erbia\" even existed. In the confusion, the original names got reversed, and the exchange of names stuck. It is now thought that those workers who used the double sodium or potassium sulfates to remove \"ceria\" from \"yttria\" inadvertently lost the terbium content of the system into the ceria-containing precipitate. In any case, what is now known as terbium was only about 1% of the original yttria, but that was sufficient to impart a yellowish color to the oxide. Thus, terbium was a minor component in the original terbium fraction, dominated by its immediate neighbors, gadolinium and dysprosium. Thereafter, whenever other rare earths were teased apart from this mixture, whichever fraction gave the brown oxide retained the terbium name, until at last it was pure. The 19th century investigators did not have the benefit of fluorescence technology, wherewith to observe the brilliant fluorescence that would have made this element much easier to track in mixtures.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nXenotime</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Terbium is never found in nature by itself, but is contained along with other rare earth elements in many minerals, including monazite ((Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)PO with up to 0.03% terbium), xenotime (YPO) and euxenite ((Y,Ca,Er,La,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)O with 1% or more terbium). The crust abundance of terbium is estimated as 1.2&nbsp;mg/kg.</p>\n<p>Currently, the richest commercial sources of terbium are the ion-adsorption clays of southern China; the concentrates with about two-thirds yttrium oxide by weight have about 1% terbia. Small amounts of terbium occur in bastnäsite and monazite; when these are processed by solvent extraction to recover the valuable heavy lanthanides as samarium-europium-gadolinium concentrate, terbium is recovered therein. Due to the large volumes of bastnäsite processed relative to the ion-adsorption clays, a significant proportion of the world's terbium supply comes from bastnäsite.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Crushed terbium-containing minerals are treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO. Terbium is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization.</p>\n<p>The most efficient separation routine for terbium salt from the rare-earth salt solution is ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. As with other rare earths, terbium metal is produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal. Calcium and tantalum impurities can be removed by vacuum remelting, distillation, amalgam formation or zone melting.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Terbium is used as a Dopant in calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate, materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures, together with ZrO.</p>\n<p>Terbium is also used in alloys and in the production of electronic devices. As a component of Terfenol-D, terbium is of use in actuators, in naval sonar systems, sensors, in the SoundBug device (its first commercial application), and other magnetomechanical devices. Terfenol-D is an alloy that expands or contracts in the presence of a magnetic field. It has the highest magnetostriction of any alloy.</p>\n<p>Terbium oxide is used in green phosphors in fluorescent lamps and color TV tubes. Sodium terbium borate is used in solid state devices. The brilliant fluorescence allows terbium to be used as a probe in biochemistry, where it somewhat resembles calcium in its behavior. Terbium \"green\" phosphors (which fluoresce a brilliant lemon-yellow) are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide the \"trichromatic\" lighting technology which is by far the largest consumer of the world's terbium supply. Trichromatic lighting provides much higher light output for a given amount of electrical energy than does incandescent lighting.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>As with the other lanthanides, terbium compounds are of low to moderate toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Terbium has no known biological role.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ \"Rare-Earth Metal Long Term Air Exposure Test\". Retrieved 2009-05-05.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>^      C. R.

  "title": "Dysprosium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Dysprosium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Dy</b> and atomic number 66. It is a rare earth element with a metallic silver luster. Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as xenotime. Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of 7 isotopes, the most abundant of which is Dy.</p>\n<p>Dysprosium was first identified in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, but was not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D. Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDysprosium sample</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Dysprosium is a rare earth element that has a metallic, bright silver luster. It is soft enough to be cut with a knife, and can be machined without sparking if overheating is avoided. Dysprosium's physical characteristics can be greatly affected even by small amounts of impurities.</p>\n<p>Dysprosium and holmium have the highest magnetic strengths of the elements, especially at low temperatures. Dysprosium has a simple ferromagnetic ordering at temperatures below 85 K (−188.2&nbsp;°C). Above 85 K (−188.2&nbsp;°C), it turns into an helical antiferromagnetic state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular basal plane layer are parallel, and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers. This unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered (paramagnetic) state at 179 K (−94&nbsp;°C).</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Dysprosium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily to form dysprosium(III) oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Dy + 3 O → 2 DyO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Dysprosium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form dysprosium hydroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Dy (s) + 6 HO (l) → 2 Dy(OH) (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Dysprosium metal vigorously reacts with all the halogens at above 200&nbsp;°C:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Dy (s) + 3 F (g) → 2 DyF (s) [green]</dd>\n<dd>2 Dy (s) + 3 Cl (g) → 2 DyCl (s) [white]</dd>\n<dd>2 Dy (s) + 3 Br (g) → 2 DyBr (s) [white]</dd>\n<dd>2 Dy (s) + 3 I (g) → 2 DyI (s) [green]</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Dysprosium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the yellow Dy(III) ions, which exist as a [Dy(OH)] complexes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Dy (s) + 3 HSO (aq) → 2 Dy (aq) + 3 SO2−\n4 (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The resulting compound, dysprosium(III) sulfate, is noticeably paramagnetic.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDysprosium sulfate, Dy(SO)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Dysprosium compounds</div>\n<p>Dysprosium halides, such as DyF and DyBr, tend to take on a yellow color. Dysprosium oxide, also known as dysprosia, is a white powder that is highly magnetic, more so than iron oxide.</p>\n<p>Dysprosium combines with various non-metals at high temperatures to form binary compounds with varying composition and oxidation states +3 and sometimes +2, such as DyN, DyP, DyH and DyH; DyS, DyS, DyS and DyS; DyB, DyB, DyB and DyB, as well as DyC and DyC.</p>\n<p>Dysprosium carbonate, Dy(CO), and dysprosium sulfate, Dy(SO), result from similar reactions. Most dysprosium compounds are soluble in water, though dysprosium carbonate tetrahydrate (Dy(CO)·4HO) and dysprosium oxalate decahydrate (Dy(CO)·10HO) are both insoluble in water.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of dysprosium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of 7 isotopes: Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, and Dy. These are all considered stable, although Dy decays by alpha decay with a half-life of over 1×10&nbsp;years. Of the naturally occurring isotopes, Dy is the most abundant at 28%, followed by Dy at 26%. The least abundant is Dy at 0.06%.</p>\n<p>Twenty-nine radioisotopes have also been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 138 to 173. The most stable of these is Dy with a half-life of approximately 3×10&nbsp;years, followed by Dy with a half-life of 144.4&nbsp;days. The least stable is Dy with a half-life of 200&nbsp;ms. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by β decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by β decay, with some exceptions. Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and Dy and Dy decay primarily by electron capture. Dysprosium also has at least 11 metastable isomers, ranging in atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is Dy, which has a half-life of 1.257&nbsp;minutes. Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, Dy, has a half-life of 28&nbsp;ns.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>In 1878, erbium ores were found to contain the oxides of holmium and thulium. French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, while working with holmium oxide, separated dysprosium oxide from it in Paris in 1886. His procedure for isolating the dysprosium involved dissolving dysprosium oxide in acid, then adding ammonia to precipitate the hydroxide. He was only able to isolate dysprosium from its oxide after more than 30 attempts at his procedure. Upon succeeding, he named the element <i>dysprosium</i> from the Greek <i>dysprositos</i> (δυσπρόσιτος), meaning \"hard to get\". However, the element was not isolated in relatively pure form until after the development of ion exchange techniques by Frank Spedding at Iowa State University in the early 1950s.</p>\n<p>In 1950, Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso, and Stanley G. Thompson bombarded Am with helium ions, which produced atoms with an atomic number of 97 and which closely resembled the neighboring lanthanide terbium. Because terbium was named after Ytterby, the city in which it and several other elements were discovered, this new element was named berkelium for the city in which it was synthesized. However, when the research team synthesized element 98, they could not think of a good analogy for dysprosium, and instead named the element californium in honor of the state in which it was synthesized. The research team went on to \"point out that, in recognition of the fact that dysprosium is named on the basis of a Greek word meaning 'difficult to get at,' that the searchers for another element a century ago found it difficult to get to California.\"</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nXenotime</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Dysprosium is never encountered as a free element, but is found in many minerals, including xenotime, fergusonite, gadolinite, euxenite, polycrase, blomstrandine, monazite and bastnäsite; often with erbium and holmium or other rare earth elements. Currently, most dysprosium is being obtained from the ion-adsorption clay ores of southern China, and future sources will include the Halls Creek region in Western Australia. In the high-yttrium version of these, dysprosium happens to be the most abundant of the heavy lanthanides, comprising up to 7–8% of the concentrate (as compared to about 65% for yttrium). The concentration of Dy in the Earth crust is about 5.2&nbsp;mg/kg and in sea water 0.9&nbsp;ng/L.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Dysprosium is obtained primarily from monazite sand, a mixture of various phosphates. The metal is obtained as a by-product in the commercial extraction of yttrium. In isolating dysprosium, most of the unwanted metals can be removed magnetically or by a flotation process. Dysprosium can then be separated from other rare earth metals by an ion exchange displacement process. The resulting dysprosium ions can then react with either fluorine or chlorine to form dysprosium fluoride, DyF, or dysprosium chloride, DyCl. These compounds can be reduced using either calcium or lithium metals in the following reactions:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 Ca + 2 DyF → 2 Dy + 3 CaF</dd>\n<dd>3 Li + DyCl → Dy + 3 LiCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The components are placed in a tantalum crucible and fired in a helium atmosphere. As the reaction progresses, the resulting halide compounds and molten dysprosium separate due to differences in density. When the mixture cools, the dysprosium can be cut away from the impurities.</p>\n<p>About 100 tonnes of dysprosium are produced worldwide each year, with 99% of that total produced in China. Dysprosium prices have climbed nearly twentyfold, from $7 per pound in 2003, to $130 a pound in late 2010. According to the United States Department of Energy, the wide range of its current and projected uses, together with the lack of any immediately suitable replacement, makes dysprosium the single most critical element for emerging clean energy technologies - even their most conservative projections predict a shortfall of dysprosium before 2015.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Dysprosium is used, in conjunction with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium oxide-nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium-cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data storage applications, such as in hard disks.</p>\n<p>Neodymium-iron-boron magnets can have up to 6% of the neodymium substituted with dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications such as drive motors for hybrid electric vehicles. This substitution would require up to 100&nbsp;grams of dysprosium per hybrid car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2&nbsp;million units per year, the use of dysprosium in applications such as this would quickly exhaust the available supply of the metal. The dysprosium substitution may also be useful in other applications, as it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets.</p>\n<p>Dysprosium is one of the components of Terfenol-D, along with iron and terbium. Terfenol-D has the highest room-temperature magnetostriction of any known material; this property is employed in transducers, wide-band mechanical resonators, and high-precision liquid fuel injectors.</p>\n<p>Dysprosium is used in dosimeters for measuring ionizing radiation. Crystals of calcium sulfate or calcium fluoride are doped with dysprosium. When these crystals are exposed to radiation, the dysprosium atoms become excited and luminescent. The luminescence can be measured to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected.</p>\n<p>Nanofibers of dysprosium compounds have high strength and large surface area; therefore, they can be used for reinforcement of other materials and as a catalyst. Fibers of dysprosium oxide fluoride can be produced by heating an aqueous solution of DyBr and NaF to 450&nbsp;°C at 450 bar pressure for 17 hours. This material is remarkably robust, surviving over 100 hours in various aqueous solutions at temperatures exceeding 400&nbsp;°C without re-dissolving or aggregating.</p>\n<p>Dysprosium iodide and dysprosium bromide are used in high intensity Metal-halide lamps. These compounds dissociate near the hot center of the lamp releasing isolated dysprosium atoms. The latter re-emit light in the green and red part of the spectrum thereby effectively producing bright light.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Like many powders, dysprosium powder may present an explosion hazard when mixed with air and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water, while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO), is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite upon contact with organic substances.</p>\n<p>Soluble dysprosium salts, such as dysprosium chloride and dysprosium nitrate, are mildly toxic when ingested. The insoluble salts, however, are non-toxic. Based on the toxicity of dysprosium chloride to mice, it is estimated that the ingestion of 500&nbsp;grams or more could be fatal to a human.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Lanthanide</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   Lide, David R., ed.

  "title": "Holmium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Holmium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Ho</b> and atomic number 67. Part of the lanthanide series, holmium is a rare earth element. Holmium was discovered by Swedish chemist Per Theodor Cleve. Its oxide was first isolated from rare earth ores in 1878 and the element was named after the city of Stockholm.</p>\n<p>Elemental holmium is a relatively soft and malleable silvery-white metal. It is too reactive to be found uncombined in nature, but when isolated, is relatively stable in dry air at room temperature. However, it reacts with water and rusts readily, and will also burn in air when heated.</p>\n<p>Holmium is found in the minerals monazite and gadolinite, and is usually commercially extracted from monazite using ion exchange techniques. Its compounds in nature, and in nearly all of its laboratory chemistry, are trivalently oxidized, containing Ho(III) ions. Trivalent holmium ions have fluorescent properties similar to many other rare earth ions (while yielding their own set of unique emission light lines), and holmium ions are thus used in the same way as some other rare earths in certain laser and glass colorant applications.</p>\n<p>Holmium has the highest magnetic strength of any element and therefore is used for the polepieces of the strongest static magnets. Because holmium strongly absorbs neutrons, it is also used in nuclear control rods.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHoO, left: natural light, right: fluorescent lamp light</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Holmium is a relatively soft and malleable element that is fairly corrosion-resistant and stable in dry air at standard temperature and pressure. In moist air and at higher temperatures, however, it quickly oxidizes, forming a yellowish oxide. In pure form, holmium possesses a metallic, bright silvery luster.</p>\n<p>Holmium oxide has some fairly dramatic color changes depending on the lighting conditions. In daylight, it is a tannish yellow color. Under trichromatic light, it is a fiery orange red, almost indistinguishable from the appearance of erbium oxide under the same lighting conditions. The change is related to the sharp emission bands of the trivalent ions of these elements, acting as phosphors.</p>\n<p>Holmium has the highest magnetic moment (10.6&nbsp;µ\nB) of any naturally occurring element and possesses other unusual magnetic properties. When combined with yttrium, it forms highly magnetic compounds. Holmium is paramagnetic at ambient conditions, but is ferromagnetic at temperatures below 19&nbsp;K.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Holmium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily to form holmium(III) oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Ho + 3 O → 2 HoO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Holmium is quite electropositive and is generally trivalent.

Holmium in solution is in the form of Ho surrounded by nine molecules of water. Holmium dissolves in acids.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of holmium</div>\n<p>Natural holmium contains one stable isotope, holmium-165. Some synthetic radioactive isotopes are known; the most stable one is holmium-163, with a half life of 4570 years. All other radioisotopes have ground-state half lives not greater than 1.117 days, and most have half lives under 3 hours. However, the metastable Ho has a half life of around 1200 years because of its high spin. This fact, combined with a high excitation energy resulting in a particularly rich spectrum of decay gamma rays produced when the metastable state de-excites, makes this isotope useful in nuclear physics experiments as a means for calibrating energy responses and intrinsic efficiencies of gamma ray spectrometers.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Holmium (<i>Holmia</i>, Latin name for Stockholm) was discovered by Marc Delafontaine and Jacques-Louis Soret in 1878 who noticed the aberrant spectrographic absorption bands of the then-unknown element (they called it \"Element X\"). Later in 1878, Per Teodor Cleve independently discovered the element while he was working on erbia earth (erbium oxide).</p>\n<p>Using the method developed by Carl Gustaf Mosander, Cleve first removed all of the known contaminants from erbia. The result of that effort was two new materials, one brown and one green. He named the brown substance holmia (after the Latin name for Cleve's home town, Stockholm) and the green one thulia. Holmia was later found to be the holmium oxide and thulia was thulium oxide. In Henry Moseley's classic paper on atomic numbers, holmium was assigned an atomic number of 66. Evidently, the holmium preparation he had been given to investigate had been grossly impure, dominated by neighboring (and unplotted) dysprosium. He would have seen x-ray emission lines for both elements, but assumed that the dominant ones belonged to holmium, instead of the dysprosium impurity.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGadolinite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Like all other rare earths, holmium is not naturally found as a free element. It does occur combined with other elements in gadolinite, monazite, and other rare-earth minerals. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia with reserves of holmium estimated as 400,000 tonnes.</p>\n<p>Holmium makes up 1.4 parts per million of the earth's crust by weight. This makes it the 56th most abundant element in the earth's crust. Holmium makes up 1 part per million of the soils, 400 parts per quadrillion of seawater, and almost none of earth's atmosphere. Holmium is rare for a lanthanide. It makes up 500 parts per trillion of the universe by weight.</p>\n<p>It is commercially extracted via ion-exchange from monazite sand (0.05% holmium) but is still difficult to separate from other rare earths. The element has been isolated through the reduction of its anhydrous chloride or fluoride with metallic calcium. Its estimated abundance in the Earth's crust is 1.3&nbsp;mg/kg. Holmium obeys the Oddo-Harkins rule: as an odd-numbered element, it is less abundant than its immediate even-numbered neighbors, dysprosium and erbium. However, it is the most abundant of the odd-numbered heavy lanthanides. The principal current source are some of the ion-adsorption clays of southern China. Some of these have a rare-earth composition similar to that found in xenotime or gadolinite. Yttrium makes up about two-thirds of the total by weight; holmium is around 1.5%. The original ores themselves are very lean, maybe only 0.1% total lanthanide, but are easily extracted. Holmium is relatively inexpensive for a rare-earth metal with the price about US$ 1000 per kg.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA solution of 4% holmium oxide in 10% perchloric acid, permanently fused into a quartz cuvette as an optical calibration standard</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Holmium has the highest magnetic strength of any element, and therefore is used to create the strongest artificially generated magnetic fields, when placed within high-strength magnets as a magnetic pole piece (also called a magnetic flux concentrator). Since it can absorb nuclear fission-bred neutrons, it is also used in nuclear control rods.</p>\n<p>Holmium is used in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG)- and yttrium-lanthanum-fluoride (YLF) solid-state lasers found in microwave equipment (which are in turn found in a variety of medical and dental settings). Holmium lasers emit at 2.08 micrometres, and therefore are safe to eyes. They are used in medical, dental, and fiber-optical applications.</p>\n<p>Holmium is one of the colorants used for cubic zirconia and glass, providing yellow or red coloring. Glass containing holmium oxide and holmium oxide solutions (usually in perchloric acid) have sharp optical absorption peaks in the spectral range 200–900&nbsp;nm. They are therefore used as a calibration standard for optical spectrophotometers, and are available commercially.</p>\n<p>The radioactive but long-lived Ho-166<i>m1</i> (see \"Isotopes\" above) is used in calibration of gamma ray spectrometers.</p>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Holmium plays no biological role in humans, but its salts are able to stimulate metabolism. Humans typically consume about a milligram of holmium a year. Plants do not readily take up holmium from the soil. Some vegetables have had their holmium content measured, and it amounted to 100 parts per trillion.</p>\n<h3>Toxicity</h3>\n<p>Large amounts of holmium salts can cause severe damage if inhaled, consumed orally, or injected. The biological effects of holmium over a long period of time are not known. Holmium has a low level of acute toxicity.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Holmium compounds</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Yiguo Su et al.; Li, Guangshe; Chen, Xiaobo; Liu, Junjie; Li, Liping (2008). \"Hydrothermal Synthesis of GdVO4:Ho3+ Nanorods with a Novel White-light Emission\".

  "title": "Erbium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Erbium</b> is a chemical element in the lanthanide series, with the symbol <b>Er</b> and atomic number 68. A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated, natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements on Earth. As such, it is a rare earth element which is associated with several other rare elements in the mineral gadolinite from Ytterby in Sweden.</p>\n<p>Erbium's principal uses involve its pink-colored Er ions, which have optical fluorescent properties particularly useful in certain laser applications. Erbium-doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media, where erbium (III) ions are optically pumped at around 980&nbsp;nm or 1480&nbsp;nm and then radiate light at 1530&nbsp;nm in stimulated emission. This process results in an unusually mechanically simple laser optical amplifier for signals transmitted by fiber optics. The 1550&nbsp;nm wavelength is especially important for optical communications because standard single mode optical fibers have minimal loss at this particular wavelength. In addition to optical fiber lasers, a large variety of medical applications (i.e. dermatology, dentistry) utilize the erbium ion's 2940&nbsp;nm emission (see Er:YAG laser), which is highly absorbed in water in tissues, making its effect very superficial. Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is helpful in laser surgery, and for the efficient production of steam for laser enamel ablation in certain types of laser dentistry.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nErbium(III)chloride in sunlight, showing some pink fluorescence of Er from natural ultraviolet.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A trivalent element, pure erbium metal is malleable (or easily shaped), soft yet stable in air, and does not oxidize as quickly as some other rare-earth metals. Its salts are rose-colored, and the element has characteristic sharp absorption spectra bands in visible light, ultraviolet, and near infrared. Otherwise it looks much like the other rare earths. Its sesquioxide is called erbia. Erbium's properties are to a degree dictated by the kind and amount of impurities present. Erbium does not play any known biological role, but is thought to be able to stimulate metabolism.</p>\n<p>Erbium is ferromagnetic below 19 K, antiferromagnetic between 19 and 80 K and paramagnetic above 80 K.</p>\n<p>Erbium can form propeller-shaped atomic clusters ErN, where the distance between the erbium atoms is 0.35&nbsp;nm.

All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 3.5&nbsp;h, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 4 minutes. This element also has 13 meta states, with the most stable being 167mEr with a half-life of 2.269&nbsp;s.</p>\n<p>The isotopes of erbium range in atomic weight from 142.9663&nbsp;u (143Er) to 176.9541&nbsp;u (177Er). The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 166Er, is electron capture, and the primary mode after is beta decay. The primary decay products before 166Er are element 67 (holmium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element 69 (thulium) isotopes.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Erbium (for Ytterby, a village in Sweden) was discovered by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1843. Mosander separated \"yttria\" from the mineral gadolinite into three fractions which he called yttria, erbia, and terbia. He named the new element after the village of Ytterby where large concentrations of yttria and erbium are located. Erbia and terbia, however, were confused at this time. After 1860, terbia was renamed erbia and after 1877 what had been known as erbia was renamed terbia. Fairly pure ErO was independently isolated in 1905 by Georges Urbain and Charles James. Reasonably pure metal wasn't produced until 1934 when Klemm and Bommer reduced the anhydrous chloride with potassium vapor. It was only in the 1990s that the price for Chinese-derived erbium oxide became low enough for erbium to be considered for use as a colorant in art glass.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMonazite sand</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The concentration of erbium in the Earth crust is about 2.8&nbsp;mg/kg and in the sea water 0.9&nbsp;ng/L. This concentration is enough to make erbium about 45th in elemental abundance in the Earth's crust.</p>\n<p>Like other rare earths, this element is never found as a free element in nature but is found bound in monazite sand ores. It has historically been very difficult and expensive to separate rare earths from each other in their ores but ion-exchange production techniques developed in the late 20th century have greatly brought down the cost of production of all rare-earth metals and their chemical compounds.</p>\n<p>The principal commercial sources of erbium are from the minerals xenotime and euxenite, and most recently, the ion adsorption clays of southern China; in consequence, China has now become the principal global supplier of this element. In the high-yttrium versions of these ore concentrates, yttrium is about two-thirds of the total by weight, and erbia is about 4–5%. When the concentrate is dissolved in acid, the erbia liberates enough erbium ion to impart a distinct and characteristic pink color to the solution. This color behavior is similar to what Mosander and the other early workers in the lanthanides would have seen in their extracts from the gadolinite minerals of Ytterby.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Crushed minerals are attacked by hydrochloric or sulfuric acid that transforms insoluble rare-earth oxides into soluble chlorides or sulfates. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO. The solution is treated with magnesium nitrate to produce a crystallized mixture of double salts of rare-earth metals. The salts are separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Erbium metal is obtained from its oxide or salts by heating with calcium at 1450 °C under argon atmosphere.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nErbium-colored glass</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Erbium's everyday uses are varied. It is commonly used as a photographic filter, and because of its resilience it is useful as a metallurgical additive. Other uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Used in nuclear technology in neutron-absorbing control rods.</li>\n<li>When added to vanadium as an alloy, erbium lowers hardness and improves workability.</li>\n<li>Erbium oxide has a pink color, and is sometimes used as a colorant for glass, cubic zirconia and porcelain. The glass is then often used in sunglasses and cheap jewelry.</li>\n<li>Erbium-doped optical silica-glass fibers are the active element in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), which are widely used in optical communications. The same fibers can be used to create fiber lasers. In order to work efficiently, Erbium-doped fiber is usually co-doped with glass modifiers/homogenizers, often aluminum or phosphorus. These dopants help prevent clustering or Er-ions and transfer the energy more efficiently between the Er ions and the signal. Co-doping of optical fiber with Er and Yb is used in high-power Er/Yb fiber lasers. Erbium can also be used in erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers.</li>\n<li>An erbium-nickel alloy ErNi has an unusually high specific heat capacity at liquid-helium temperatures and is used in cryocoolers; a mixture of 65% ErCo and 35% ErYbNi by volume improves the specific heat capacity even more.</li>\n<li>A large variety of medical applications (i.e. dermatology, dentistry) utilize erbium ion's 2940&nbsp;nm emission (see Er:YAG laser), which is highly absorbed in water (absorption coefficient about 12000/cm). Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is necessary for laser surgery, and the efficient production of steam for laser enamel ablation in dentistry.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biological role</h2>\n<p>Erbium does not have a biological role, but erbium salts can stimulate metabolism. Humans consume 1 milligram of erbium a year on average. The highest concentration of erbium in humans is in the bones, but there is also erbium in the human kidneys and liver.</p>\n<h3>Toxicity</h3>\n<p>Erbium is slightly toxic if ingested, but erbium compounds are not toxic. Metallic erbium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard.</p>\n<h2>Popular culture</h2>\n<p>In Carl Sagan's novel \"Contact\", a machine is constructed from a blueprint received through an extraterrestrial radio transmission. An important (and unexplained) component of the machine are dowels constructed out of erbium.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Erbium compounds</li>\n<li>Terbium</li>\n<li>Ytterbium</li>\n<li>Yttrium</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^    Emsley, John (2001). \"Erbium\".

  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with thallium&nbsp;or thorium.</div>\n\n<p><b>Thulium</b> is a chemical element that has the symbol <b>Tm</b> and atomic number 69. It is the second least abundant of the lanthanides after promethium, which is only found in trace quantities on Earth. Thulium is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery-gray luster. It is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air. Despite its high price and rarity, thulium is used as the radiation source in portable X-ray devices and in solid-state lasers. It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic.</p>\n\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Pure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster. It slowly tarnishes in air and reacts with water. The metal can be cut with a knife, as it has a Mohs hardness of 2 to 3; it is malleable and ductile. Thulium is ferromagnetic below 32 K, antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56 K, and paramagnetic above 56 K. Liquid thulium is very volatile.</p>\n<p>Thulium has two major allotropes: the tetragonal α-Tm and the more stable hexagonal β-Tm.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Thulium tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily at 150&nbsp;°C to form thulium(III) oxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Tm + 3 O → 2 TmO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Thulium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form thulium hydroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Tm (s) + 6 HO (l) → 2 Tm(OH) (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Thulium reacts with all the halogens.

In those compounds, thulium exhibits valence states +2, +3 and +4, however, the +3 state is most common and only this state has been observed in Tm solutions. Thulium exists as a Tm ion in solution. In this state, the thulium ion is surrounded by nine molecules of water. Thulium's only known oxide is TmO. This oxide is sometimes called \"thulia\". Reddish-purple thulium (II) compounds can be made by the reduction of thulium (III) compounds. Examples of thulium (II) compounds include thulium halides. Some hydrated thulium compounds, such as TmCl<b>·</b>7HO and Tm(CO)<b>·</b>6HO are green or greenish-white. Thulium dichloride reacts very vigorously with water. This reaction results in hydrogen gas and Tm(OH) exhibiting a fading reddish color. Combination of thulium and chalcogens results in thulium chalcogenides. Tm ions exhibit a bright blue luminescence.</p>\n<p>Thulium reacts with hydrogen chloride to produce hydrogen gas and thulium chloride. With nitric acid it yields thulium nitrate, or Tm(NO).</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of thulium</div>\n<p>The isotopes of thulium range from Tm to Tm. The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, Tm, is electron capture, and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay products before Tm are element 68 (erbium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element 70 (ytterbium) isotopes.</p>\n<p>Thulium-169 is thulium's longest-lived and most abundant isotope. It is the only isotope of thulium that is thought to be stable, but thulium-169 may instead be radioactive. After thulium-169, the next-longest-lived isotopes are thulium-171, which has a half-life of 1.92 years, and thulium-170, which has a half-life of 128.6 days. Most other isotopes have half-lives of a few minutes or less. Thirty-five isotopes and 26 nuclear isomers of thulium have been detected. Most isotopes of thulium lighter than 169 atomic mass units decay via electron capture or β+ decay, although some exhibit significant alpha decay or proton emission. Heavier isotopes experience β- decay.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Thulium was discovered by Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve in 1879 by looking for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements (this was the same method Carl Gustaf Mosander earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements). Cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of erbia (ErO). Upon additional processing, he obtained two new substances; one brown and one green. The brown substance was the oxide of the element holmium and was named holmia by Cleve, and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element. Cleve named the oxide thulia and its element thulium after Thule, Scandinavia. Thulium's atomic symbol was once Tu, but this was changed to Tm.</p>\n<p>Thulium was so rare that none of the early workers had enough of it to purify sufficiently to actually see the green color; they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands, as erbium was progressively removed. The first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was Charles James, a British expatriate working on a large scale at New Hampshire College in Durham. In 1911 he reported his results, having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. He famously needed 15,000 \"operations\" to establish that the material was homogeneous.</p>\n<p>High-purity thulium oxide was first offered commercially in the late 1950s, as a result of the adoption of ion-exchange separation technology. Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash &amp; Chemical Corporation offered it in grades of 99% and 99.9% purity. The price per kilogram has oscillated between US$4,600 and $13,300 in the period from 1959 to 1998 for 99.9% purity, and it was second highest for lanthanides behind lutetium.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The element is never found in nature in pure form, but it is found in small quantities in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth crust is 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by mols. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists on concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1 part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Thulium is principally extracted from monazite (~0.007% thulium) ores found in river sands, through ion-exchange. Newer ion-exchange and solvent-extraction techniques have led to easier separation of the rare earths, which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production. The principal sources today are the ion adsorption clays of southern China. In these, where about two-thirds of the total rare-earth content is yttrium, thulium is about 0.5% (or about tied with lutetium for rarity). The metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a closed container. None of thulium's natural compounds are commercially important. Approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced. In 1996, thulium oxide cost US$20 per gram, and in 2005, 99%-pure thulium metal powder cost US$70 per gram.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Despite being rare and expensive, thulium has a few applications.</p>\n<h3>Laser</h3>\n<p>Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped YAG (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is an active laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2097&nbsp;nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate between 1930 and 2040&nbsp;nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water. This makes thulium lasers attractive for laser-based surgery.</p>\n<h3>X-ray source</h3>\n<p>Despite its high cost, portable X-ray devices use thulium that has been bombarded in a nuclear reactor as a radiation source. These sources have a useful life of about one year, as tools in medical and dental diagnosis, as well as to detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components. Such sources do not need extensive radiation protection – only a small cup of lead.</p>\n<p>Thulium-170 is gaining popularity as an X-ray source for cancer treatment via brachytherapy. This isotope has a half-life of 128.6 days and five major emission lines of comparable intensity (at 7.4, 51.354, 52.389, 59.4 and 84.253 keV). Thulium-170 is one of the four most popular radioisotopes for use in industrial radiography.</p>\n<h3>Others</h3>\n<p>Thulium has been used in high-temperature superconductors similarly to yttrium. Thulium potentially has use in ferrites, ceramic magnetic materials that are used in microwave equipment. Thulium is also similar to scandium in that it is used in arc lighting for its unusual spectrum, in this case, its green emission lines, which are not covered by other elements. Because thulium fluoresces with a blue color when exposed to ultraviolet light, thulium is put into euro banknotes as a measure against counterfeiting. The blue fluorescence of Tm-doped calcium sulfate has been used in personal dosimeters for visual monitoring of radiation.</p>\n<h2>Biological role and precautions</h2>\n<p>There is only a very small amount of thulium in the human body, but the exact amount is unknown. Thulium has not been observed to have a biological role, but small amounts of soluble thulium salts stimulate metabolism. Soluble thulium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble thulium salts are completely nontoxic. When injected, thulium can cause degeneration of the liver and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration to fluctuate. Liver damage from thulium is more prevalent in male mice than female mice. Despite this, thulium has a low level of toxicity. In humans, thulium occurs in the highest amounts in the liver, kidneys and bones. Humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year. The roots of plants do not take up thulium, and the dry weight of vegetables usually contains one part per billion of thulium. Thulium dust and powder are toxic upon inhalation or ingestion and can cause explosions. Radioactive thulium isotopes can cause radiation poisoning.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Thulium compounds</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^             Emsley, John (2001).

  "title": "Ytterbium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with yttrium.</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Ytterbium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Yb</b> and atomic number&nbsp;70. It is the fourteenth and penultimate element in the lanthanide series, or last element in the f-block, which is the basis of the relative stability of the +2 oxidation state. However, like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules. Because of its closed-shell electron configuration, its density and melting and boiling points differ from those of the other lanthanides.</p>\n<p>In 1878, the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac separated in the rare earth \"erbia\" another independent component, which he called \"ytterbia\", for Ytterby, the village in Sweden near where he found the new component of erbium. He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called \"ytterbium\" (in total, four elements were named after the village, the others being yttrium, terbium and erbium). In 1907, the new earth \"lutecia\" was separated from ytterbia, from which the element \"lutecium\" (now lutetium) was extracted by Georges Urbain, Carl Auer von Welsbach, and Charles James. After some discussion, Marignac's name \"ytterbium\" was retained. A relatively pure sample of the metal was obtained only in 1953. At present, ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media, and less often as a gamma ray source.</p>\n<p>Natural ytterbium is a mixture of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals monazite, euxenite, and xenotime. The ytterbium concentration is low, because the element is found among many other rare earth elements; moreover, it is among the least abundant ones. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and explosion hazard.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Ytterbium is a soft, malleable and ductile chemical element that displays a bright silvery luster when in its pure form. It is a rare earth element, and it is readily attacked and dissolved by the strong mineral acids. It reacts slowly with cold water and it oxidizes slowly in air.</p>\n<p>Ytterbium has three allotropes labeled by the Greek letters alpha, beta and gamma; their transformation temperatures are −13 °C and 795 °C, although the exact transformation temperature depends on the pressure and stress. The beta allotrope exists at room temperature, and it has a face-centered cubic crystal structure. The high-temperature gamma allotrope has a body-centered cubic crystalline structure. The alpha allotrope has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is stable at low temperatures. Normally, the beta allotrope has a metallic electrical conductivity, but it becomes a semiconductor when exposed to a pressure of about 16,000 atmospheres (1.6 GPa). Its electrical resistivity increases ten times upon compression to 39,000 atmospheres (3.9 GPa), but then drops to about 10% of its room-temperature resistivity at about 40,000 atm (4.0 GPa).</p>\n<p>In contrast with the other rare-earth metals, which usually have antiferromagnetic and/or ferromagnetic properties at low temperatures, ytterbium is paramagnetic at temperatures above 1.0 kelvin. However, the alpha allotrope is diamagnetic. With a melting point of 824 °C and a boiling point of 1196 °C, ytterbium has the smallest liquid range of all the metals.</p>\n<p>Contrary to most other lanthanides, which have a close-packed hexagonal lattice, ytterbium crystallizes in the face-centered cubic structure. As a result, its density (6.973&nbsp;g/cm) is significantly lower than, e.g., those of the neighboring elements thulium (9.32&nbsp;g/cm) and lutetium (9.841&nbsp;g/cm). The melting and boiling points of ytterbium are also significantly lower than those of thulium and lutetium. These properties stem from the closed-shell electron configuration of ytterbium ([Xe] 4f 6s), which causes only the two 6s electrons to be available for metallic bonding (in contrast to the other lanthanides where three electrons are available).</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Ytterbium metal tarnishes slowly in air. Finely dispersed ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald-green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.</p>\n<p>Ytterbium is quite electropositive, and it reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form ytterbium(III) hydroxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Yb (s) + 6 HO (l) → 2 Yb(OH) (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Ytterbium reacts with all the halogens:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Yb (s) + 3 F (g) → 2 YbF (s) [white]</dd>\n<dd>2 Yb (s) + 3 Cl (g) → 2 YbCl (s) [white]</dd>\n<dd>2 Yb (s) + 3 Br (g) → 2 YbBr (s) [white]</dd>\n<dd>2 Yb (s) + 3 I (g) → 2 YbI (s) [white]</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The ytterbium(III) ion absorbs light in the near infrared range of wavelengths, but not in visible light, so the mineral ytterbia, YbO, is white in color and the salts of ytterbium are also colorless. Ytterbium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions that contain the colorless Yb(III) ions, which exist as nonahydrate complexes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Yb (s) + 3 HSO (aq) → 2 [Yb(HO)] (aq) + 3 SO2−\n4 (aq) + 3 H (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Yb(II) vs. Yb(III)</h3>\n<p>Although usually trivalent, ytterbium readily forms divalent compounds. This behavior is unusual to most lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 state has an valence electron configuration of 4<i>f</i> because the fully filled <i>f</i>-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion is a very strong reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium(II) behaves similarly to europium(II) and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of ytterbium</div>\n<p>Natural ytterbium is composed of seven stable isotopes: Yb, Yb, Yb, Yb, Yb, Yb, and Yb, with Yb being the most abundant isotope, at 31.8% of the natural abundance). 27 radioisotopes have been observed, with the most stable ones being Yb with a half-life of 32.0 days, Yb with a half-life of 4.18 days, and Yb with a half-life of 56.7 hours. All of its remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than two hours and most of these have half-lives are less than 20 minutes. Ytterbium also has 12 meta states, with the most stable being Yb (<i>t</i> 46 seconds).</p>\n<p>The isotopes of ytterbium range in atomic weight from 147.9674 atomic mass unit (u) for Yb to 180.9562&nbsp;u for Yb. The primary decay mode of ytterbium isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope, Yb, is electron capture, and the primary decay mode for those heavier than Yb is beta decay. The primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes lighter than Yb are thulium isotopes, and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with heavier than Yb are lutetium isotopes.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEuxenite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Ytterbium is found with other rare earth elements in several rare minerals. It is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand (0.03% ytterbium). The element is also found in euxenite and xenotime. The main mining areas are China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia; and reserves of ytterbium are estimated as one million tonnes. Ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths, but ion-exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the mid- to late 20th century have simplified separation. Known compounds of ytterbium are rare and have not yet been well characterized. The abundance of ytterbium in the Earth's crust is about 3&nbsp;mg/kg.</p>\n<p>As an even-numbered lanthanide, in accordance with the Oddo-Harkins rule, ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, thulium and lutetium, which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting the fact that ytterbium has few commercial applications. Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the Yb:YAG laser, a solid-state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>It is somewhat difficult to separate ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bond to in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to the different types of bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.</p>\n<p>Ytterbium is separated from other rare earths either by ion exchange or by reduction with sodium amalgam. In the latter method, a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium-mercury alloy, which reduces and dissolves Yb. The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid. The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating. The oxide is reduced to metal by heating with lanthanum, aluminium, cerium or zirconium in high vacuum. The metal is purified by sublimation and collected over a condensed plate.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nYtterbium(III) oxide</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Category:Ytterbium compounds</div>\n<p>The chemical behavior of ytterbium is similar to that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced by hydrogen, zinc dust, or by the addition of metallic ytterbium to the dihalides. The +2 oxidation state only occurs in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as calcium oxide (CaO).</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCrystal structure of ytterbium(III) oxide</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Ytterbium forms both dihalides and trihalides with the halogens fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The dihalides are susceptible to oxidation to the trihalides at room temperature and disproportionate to the trihalides and metallic ytterbium at high temperature:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 YbX → 2 YbX + Yb (X = F, Cl, Br, I)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Some ytterbium halides are used as reagents in organic synthesis. For example, ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl) is a Lewis acid and can be used as a catalyst in the Aldol and Diels–Alder reactions. Ytterbium(II) iodide (YbI) may be used, like samarium(II) iodide, as a reducing agent for coupling reactions. Ytterbium(III) fluoride (YbF) is used as an inert and non-toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions, which is good for dental health, and is also a good X-ray contrast agent.</p>\n<h3>Oxides</h3>\n<p>Ytterbium reacts with oxygen to form ytterbium(III) oxide (YbO), which crystallizes in the \"rare-earth C-type sesquioxide\" structure which is related to the fluorite structure with one quarter of the anions removed, leading to ytterbium atoms in two different six coordinate (non-octahedral) environments. Ytterbium(III) oxide can be reduced to ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) with elemental ytterbium, which crystallizes in the same structure as sodium chloride.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nJean Charles Galissard de Marignac</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Ytterbium was discovered by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in the year 1878. While examining samples of gadolinite, Marignac found a new component in the earth then known as erbia, and he named it ytterbia, for Ytterby, the Swedish village near where he found the new component of erbium. Marignac suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called \"ytterbium\".</p>\n<p>In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain separated Marignac's ytterbia into two components: neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia would later become known as the element ytterbium, and lutecia would later be known as the element lutetium. The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium; the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time. Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party. The Commission on Atomic Mass, consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Georges Urbain, which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, based on the fact that the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain; after Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium.</p>\n<p>The chemical and physical properties of ytterbium could not be determined with any precision until 1953, when the first nearly pure ytterbium metal was produced by using ion-exchange processes. The price of ytterbium was relatively stable between 1953 and 1998 at about US$1,000/kg.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Source of gamma rays</h3>\n<p>The Yb isotope (with a half-life of 32 days), which is created along with the short-lived Yb isotope (half-life 4.2 days) by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors, has been used as a radiation source in portable X-ray machines. Like X-rays, the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body, but are blocked by bones and other dense materials. Thus, small Yb samples (which emit gamma rays) act like tiny X-ray machines useful for radiography of small objects. Experiments show that radiographs taken with a Yb source are roughly equivalent to those taken with X-rays having energies between 250 and 350 keV. Yb is also used in nuclear medicine.</p>\n<h3>Doping of stainless steel</h3>\n<p>Ytterbium can also be used as a dopant to help improve the grain refinement, strength, and other mechanical properties of stainless steel. Some ytterbium alloys have rarely been used in dentistry.</p>\n<h3>Ytterbium as dopant of active media</h3>\n<p>The ytterbium +3 ion is used as a doping material in active laser media, specifically in solid state lasers and double clad fiber lasers. Ytterbium lasers are highly efficient, have long lifetimes and can generate short pulses; ytterbium can also easily be incorporated into the material used to make the laser. Ytterbium lasers commonly radiate in the 1.06–1.12&nbsp;µm band being optically pumped at wavelength 900&nbsp;nm–1&nbsp;µm, dependently on the host and application. The small quantum defect makes ytterbium a prospective dopant for efficient lasers and power scaling.</p>\n<p>The kinetic of excitations in ytterbium-doped materials is simple and can be described within the concept of effective cross-sections; for most ytterbium-doped laser materials (as for many other optically pumped gain media), the McCumber relation holds, although the application to the ytterbium-doped composite materials was under discussion.</p>\n<p>Usually, low concentrations of ytterbium are used. At high concentrations, the ytterbium-doped materials show photodarkening (glass fibers) or even a switch to broadband emission (crystals and ceramics) instead of efficient laser action. This effect may be related with not only overheating, but also with conditions of charge compensation at high concentrations of ytterbium ions.</p>\n<p>Much progress has been made in the power scaling Lasers and Amplifiers produced with ytterbium (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1 KW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb doped fibers themselves. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area (LMA) fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2&lt;1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration . Ytterbium doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter (MFD) which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillion scattering (SBS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provides a distinct advantage over single mode Yb doped fibers.</p>\n<p>In order to achieve even higher power levels in Yb based fiber systems all factors of the fiber must be considered. These can only be achieved via optimization of all the Yb fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, in order to reduce the splice losses within the cavity,. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity . The optimization of the Yb doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber and improved photodarkening performance. All of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 micron systems.</p>\n<h3>Others</h3>\n<p>Ytterbium metal increases its electrical resistivity when subjected to high stresses. This property is used in stress gauges to monitor ground deformations from earthquakes and explosions.</p>\n<p>Light waves vibrate faster than microwaves, and therefore optical clocks can be more precise than caesium atomic clocks. The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) is working on several such optical clocks. The model with one single ytterbium ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate. The optical clock based on it is exact to 17 digits after the decimal point.</p>\n<p>Currently, ytterbium is being investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares. As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than magnesium oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Although ytterbium is fairly stable chemically, it is stored in airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box to protect the metal from air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although initial studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. Ytterbium compounds are, however, known to cause irritation to the human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^       Hammond, C. R.

  "title": "Lutetium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Lutetium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Lu</b> and atomic number 71. It is a silvery white metal which resists corrosion in dry, but not moist, air. It is the last element in the lanthanide series, and traditionally counted among the rare earths.</p>\n<p>Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. All of these men found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium. The dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after, with Urbain and von Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other; the naming honor went to Urbain as he published his results earlier. He chose the name lutecium for the new element but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones; however, the name <b>cassiopeium</b> (or later <b>cassiopium</b>) for element 71 proposed by von Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s.</p>\n<p>Lutetium is not a particularly abundant element, though significantly more common than silver in the earth's crust; it has few specific uses. Lutetium-176 is a relatively abundant (2.5%) radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 38 billion years, and so used to determine the age of meteorites. Lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions. Lu-DOTA-TATE is used for radionuclide therapy (see Nuclear medicine) on neuroendocrine tumours.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>A lutetium atom has 71 electrons, arranged in the configuration [Xe]&nbsp;4f5d6s. When entering a chemical reaction, the atom loses its two outermost electrons and the single 5d-electron; this is unusual since reactions of the other lanthanides invariably involve f-shell electrons. The lutetium atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms, due to the lanthanide contraction, and as a result lutetium has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides. Some of these properties can be explained by its position in the d-block, which gives the metal properties of some heavier transition metals. Occasionally, lutetium is classified as a transition metal on this basis, although the IUPAC classifies it as a lanthanide.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties and compounds</h3>\n<div>See also category: Lutetium compounds</div>\n<p>Lutetium's compounds always contain the element in the oxidation state +3. Aqueous solutions of most lutetium salts are colorless and form white crystalline solids upon drying, with the common exception of the iodide. The soluble salts, such as nitrate, sulfate and acetate form hydrates upon crystallization. The oxide, hydroxide, fluoride, carbonate, phosphate and oxalate are insoluble in water.</p>\n<p>Lutetium metal is slightly unstable in air at standard conditions, but it burns readily at 150&nbsp;°C to form lutetium oxide. The resulting compound is known to adsorb water and carbon dioxide, and may be used to remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres. Similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water (slow when cold and fast when hot); lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction. Lutetium metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form trihalides; all of them (except the fluoride) are soluble in water.</p>\n<p>Lutetium dissolves readily in weak acids and dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the colorless lutetium ions, which exist as a [Lu(HO)] complex:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2&nbsp;Lu + 3&nbsp;HSO + 18&nbsp;HO → 2&nbsp;[Lu(HO)] + 3&nbsp;SO2–\n4 + 3&nbsp;H↑</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of lutetium</div>\n<p>Lutetium occurs on the Earth in form of two isotopes: lutetium-175 and lutetium-176. Out of these two, only the former is stable, making the element monoisotopic. The latter one, lutetium-176, decays via beta decay with a half-life of 3.78×10 years; it makes up about 2.5% of natural lutetium. To date, 32 synthetic radioisotopes of the element have been characterized, ranging in mass from 149.973 (lutetium-150) to 183.961 (lutetium-184); the most stable such isotopes are lutetium-174 with a half-life of 3.31 years, and lutetium-173 with a half-life of 1.37 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 9 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half an hour. Isotopes lighter than the stable lutetium-175 decay via electron capture (to produce isotopes of ytterbium), with some alpha and positron emission); the heavier isotopes decay primarily via beta decay, producing hafnium isotopes.</p>\n<p>The element also has 42 nuclear isomers, with masses of 150, 151, 153—162, 166—180 (not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer). The most stable of them are lutetium-177m, with half-life of 160.4 days and lutetium-174m, with half-life of 142 days; this is longer than half-lives of the ground states of all radioactive lutetium isotopes, except only for lutetium-173, 174, and 176.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Lutetium, derived from the Latin <i>Lutetia</i> (Paris), was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. They found it as an impurity in ytterbia, which was thought by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium. The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose <i>neoytterbium</i> and <i>lutecium</i>, while Welsbach chose <i>aldebaranium</i> and <i>cassiopeium</i>. Both of these articles accused each other of publishing results based on the other party.</p>\n<p>The International Commission on Atomic Weights, which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, based on the fact that the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain; after Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium. Until the 1950s, some German chemists called lutetium by von Welsbach's name <i>cassiopeium</i>; in 1949, the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. However, Welsbach's 1907 samples of lutetium had been pure, while Urbain's 1907 samples only contained traces of lutetium. This later misled Urbain into thinking that he had discovered element 72, which he named celtium, which was actually very pure lutetium. Charles James, who stayed out of the priority argument, worked on a much larger scale and possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time. Pure lutetium metal was first produced in 1953.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMonazite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Found with almost all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, lutetium is very difficult to separate from other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce,La,etc.)PO which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust is only about 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal is very difficult to prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.</p>\n<p>Crushed minerals are treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl or LuF by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 LuCl + 3 Ca → 2 Lu + 3 CaCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Because of the rarity and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses. However, stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.</p>\n<p>Lutetium aluminium garnet (AlLuO) has been proposed for use as a lens material in high refractive index immersion lithography. Additionally, a tiny amount of lutetium is added as a dopant to gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), which is used in magnetic bubble memory devices. Cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography (PET). Lutetium is used as a phosphor in LED light bulbs.</p>\n<p>Aside from stable lutetium, its radioactive isotopes have several specific uses. The suitable half-life and decay mode made lutetium-176 used as a pure beta emitter, using lutetium which has been exposed to neutron activation, and in lutetium–hafnium dating to date meteorites. The synthetic isotope lutetium-177 bound to octreotate (a somatostatin analogue), is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors.</p>\n<p>Lutetium tantalate (LuTaO) is the densest known stable white material (density 9.81 g/cm) and therefore is an ideal host for X-ray phosphors. The only denser white material is thorium dioxide, with density of 10 g/cm, but the thorium it contains is radioactive.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Like other rare-earth metals, lutetium is regarded as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.</p>\n<p>Similarly to other group 3 elements and lanthanides, lutetium has no known biological role, but it is found even in humans, concentrating in bones, and to a lesser extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.

  "title": "Hafnium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Hafnium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Hf</b> and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Hafnium was the penultimate stable isotope element to be discovered (rhenium was identified two years later). Hafnium is named after <i>Hafnia</i>, the Latin name for \"Copenhagen\", where it was discovered.</p>\n<p>Hafnium is used in filaments and electrodes. Some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at 45&nbsp;nm and smaller feature lengths. Some superalloys used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with niobium, titanium, or tungsten.</p>\n<p>Hafnium's large neutron capture cross-section makes it a good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants, but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron-transparent corrosion-resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical characteristics</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHafnium bits</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, ductile metal that is corrosion-resistant and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its having the same number of valence electrons and being in the same group). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.</p>\n<p>A notable physical difference between these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron-capture cross-section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and it is commonly used for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the claddings of their nuclear fuel rods.</p>\n<h3>Chemical characteristics</h3>\n<div>See also category: Hafnium compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHafnium dioxide</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hafnium reacts in air to form a protective film that inhibits further corrosion. The metal is not readily attacked by acids but can be oxidized with halogens or it can be burnt in air. Like its sister metal zirconium, finely divided hafnium can ignite spontaneously in air—similar to that obtained in Dragon's Breath. The metal is resistant to concentrated alkalis.</p>\n<p>The chemistry of hafnium and zirconium is so similar that the two cannot be separated on the basis of differing chemical reactions. The melting points and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the major differences in the chemistry of these twin elements.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of hafnium</div>\n<p>At least 34 isotopes of hafnium have been observed, ranging in mass number from 153 to 186. The five stable isotopes are in the range of 176 to 180. The radioactive isotopes' half-lives range from only 400&nbsp;ms for Hf, to 2.0&nbsp;petayears (10 years) for the most stable one, Hf.</p>\n<p>The nuclear isomer Hf was at the center of a controversy for several years regarding its potential use as a weapon.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nZircon crystal (2×2 cm) from Tocantins, Brazil</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hafnium is estimated to make up about 5.8 ppm of the Earth's upper crust by weight. It does not exist as a free element in nature, but is found combined in solid solution for zirconium in natural zirconium compounds such as zircon, ZrSiO, which usually has about 1 – 4% of the Zr replaced by Hf. Rarely, the Hf/Zr ratio increases during crystallization to give the isostructural mineral 'hafnon' (Hf,Zr)SiO, with atomic Hf &gt; Zr. An old (obsolete) name for a variety of zircon containing unusually high Hf content is <i>alvite</i>.</p>\n<p>A major source of zircon (and hence hafnium) ores are heavy mineral sands ore deposits, pegmatites particularly in Brazil and Malawi, and carbonatite intrusions particularly the Crown Polymetallic Deposit at Mount Weld, Western Australia. A potential source of hafnium is trachyte tuffs containing rare zircon-hafnium silicates eudialyte or armstrongite, at Dubbo in New South Wales, Australia.</p>\n<p>Hafnium reserves are projected to last under 10 years if the world population increases and demand grows.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMelted tip of a hafnium consumable electrode used in an ebeam remelting furnace</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The heavy mineral sands ore deposits of the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile yield most of the mined zirconium, and therefore also most of the hafnium.</p>\n<p>Zirconium is a good nuclear fuel-rod cladding metal, with the desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source for hafnium.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA lump of hafnium which has been oxidized on one side and exhibits thin film optical effects.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are nearly identical, which makes the two difficult to separate. The methods first used — fractional crystallization of ammonium fluoride salts or the fractionated distillation of the chloride — have not proven suitable for an industrial-scale production. After zirconium was chosen as material for nuclear reactor programs in the 1940s, a separation method had to be developed. Liquid-liquid extraction processes with a wide variety of solvents were developed and are still used for the production of hafnium. About half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a by-product of zirconium refinement. The end product of the separation is hafnium(IV) chloride. The purified hafnium(IV) chloride is converted to the metal by reduction with magnesium or sodium, as in the Kroll process.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>HfCl + 2 Mg (1100&nbsp;°C) → 2 MgCl + Hf</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Further purification is effected by a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, hafnium reacts with iodine at temperatures of 500&nbsp;°C, forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of 1700&nbsp;°C the reverse reaction happens, and the iodine and hafnium are set free. The hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament, and the iodine can react with additional hafnium, resulting in a steady turn over.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>Hf + 2 I (500&nbsp;°C) → HfI</dd>\n<dd>HfI (1700&nbsp;°C) → Hf + 2 I</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Chemical compounds</h2>\n<p>Hafnium and zirconium form nearly identical series of chemical compounds. Hafnium tends to form inorganic compounds in the oxidation state of +4. Halogens react with it to form hafnium tetrahalides. At higher temperatures, hafnium reacts with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Due to the lanthanide contraction of the elements in the sixth period, zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii. The ionic radius of Zr is 0.79&nbsp;angstrom and that of Hf is 0.78&nbsp;angstrom.</p>\n<p>Hafnium(IV) chloride and hafnium(IV) iodide have some applications in the production and purification of hafnium metal. They are volatile solids with polymeric structures. These tetrachlorides are precursors to various organohafnium compounds such as hafnocene dichloride and tetrabenzylhafnium.</p>\n<p>The white hafnium oxide (HfO), with a melting point of 2812&nbsp;°C and a boiling point of roughly 5100&nbsp;°C, is very similar to zirconia, but slightly more basic. Hafnium carbide is the most refractory binary compound known, with a melting point over 3890&nbsp;°C, and hafnium nitride is the most refractory of all known metal nitrides, with a melting point of 3310&nbsp;°C. This has led to proposals that hafnium or its carbides might be useful as construction materials that are subjected to very high temperatures. The mixed carbide tantalum hafnium carbide (Ta\n4HfC\n5) possesses the highest melting point of any currently known compound, 4215&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPhotographic recording of the characteristic X-ray emission lines of some elements</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In his report on <i>The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements</i>, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly predicted the existence of a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties.</p>\n<p>The X-ray spectroscopy done by Henry Moseley in 1914 showed a direct dependency between spectral line and effective nuclear charge. This led to the nuclear charge, or atomic number of an element, being used to ascertain its place within the periodic table. With this method, Moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed the gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers 43, 61, 72, and 75.</p>\n<p>The discovery of the gaps led to an extensive search for the missing elements. In 1914, several people claimed the discovery after Henry Moseley predicted the gap in the periodic table for the then-undiscovered element 72. Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the rare earth elements in 1907 and published his results on <i>celtium</i> in 1911. Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior matched with the element found later, and therefore his claim was turned down after a long-standing controversy. The controversy was partly because the chemists favored the chemical techniques which led to the discovery of <i>celtium</i>, while the physicists relied on the use of the new X-ray spectroscopy method that proved that the substances discovered by Urbain did not contain element 72. By early 1923, several physicists and chemists such as Niels Bohr and Charles R. Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group. These suggestions were based on Bohr's theories of the atom, the X-ray spectroscopy of Mosley, and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth.</p>\n<p>Encouraged by these suggestions and by the reappearance in 1922 of Urbain's claims that element 72 was a rare earth element discovered in 1911, Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy were motivated to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. It was ultimately found in zircon in Norway through X-ray spectroscopy analysis. The place where the discovery took place led to the element being named for the Latin name for \"Copenhagen\", <i>Hafnia</i>, the home town of Niels Bohr. Today, the Faculty of Science of the University of Copenhagen uses in its seal a stylized image of the hafnium atom.</p>\n<p>Hafnium was separated from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer were the first to prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetra-iodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924. This process for differential purification of zirconium and hafnium is still in use today.</p>\n<p>In 1923, four predicted elements were still missing from the periodic table: 43 (technetium) and 61 (promethium) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making elements 75 (rhenium) and 72 (hafnium) the last two unknown non-radioactive elements. Since rhenium was discovered in 1925, hafnium was the next to last element with stable isotopes to be discovered.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Several details contribute to the fact that there are only a few technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium makes it possible to use zirconium for most of the applications; second, hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium-free zirconium in the late 1950s. Furthermore, the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity.</p>\n<p>Most of the hafnium produced is used in the production of control rods for nuclear reactors.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear reactors</h3>\n<p>The nuclei of several hafnium isotopes can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes hafnium a good material for use in the control rods for nuclear reactors. Its neutron-capture cross-section is about 600 times that of zirconium. (Other elements that are good neutron-absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron.) Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of a pressurized water reactors. The German research reactor FRM II uses hafnium as a neutron absorber.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHafnium-containing rocket nozzle of the Apollo Lunar Module in the lower right corner</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hafnium is used in iron, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and other metal alloys. An alloy used for liquid rocket thruster nozzles, for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules is C103, which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium.</p>\n<p>Small additions of hafnium increase the adherence of protective oxide scales on nickel-based alloys. It improves thereby the corrosion resistance especially under cyclic temperature conditions that tend to break oxide scales by inducing thermal stresses between the bulk material and the oxide layer.</p>\n<h3>Microprocessors</h3>\n<p>The electronics industry discovered that hafnium-based compound can be employed in gate insulators in the 45&nbsp;nm generation of integrated circuits from Intel, IBM and others. Hafnium oxide-based compounds are practical high-k dielectrics, allowing reduction of the gate leakage current which improves performance at such scales.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>Due to its heat resistance and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen, hafnium is a good scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in gas-filled and incandescent lamps. Hafnium is also used as the electrode in plasma cutting because of its ability to shed electrons into air.</p>\n<p>The high energy content of Hf was the concern of a DARPA funded program in the US. This program determined the possibility of using a nuclear isomer of hafnium (the above mentioned Hf) to construct high yield weapons with X-ray triggering mechanisms—an application of <i>induced gamma emission</i>, was infeasible because of its expense. See Hafnium controversy.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDragon's Breath at night</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Care needs to be taken when machining hafnium because, like its sister metal zirconium, when hafnium is divided into fine particles, it is pyrophoric and can ignite spontaneously in air—similar to that obtained in Dragon's Breath. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nuclear isomer</li>\n<li>Induced gamma emission</li>\n<li>Zircon</li>\n<li>Zirconium</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^       Schemel, J.

  "title": "Tantalum",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Tantalum</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Ta</b> and atomic number 73. Previously known as <i>tantalium</i>, the name comes from <i>Tantalus</i>, a character from Greek mythology. Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion resistant. It is part of the refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum, but its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers. Tantalum, always together with the chemically similar niobium, occurs in the minerals tantalite, columbite and coltan (a mix of columbite and tantalite).</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Tantalum was discovered in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg. One year earlier, Charles Hatchett had discovered the element columbium. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918 g/cm, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density 7.935 g/cm, and concluded that the two oxides, despite their difference in measured density, were identical. He decided to keep the name tantalum. After Friedrich Wöhler confirmed these results, it was thought that columbium and tantalum were the same element. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two additional elements in the tantalite sample, and he named them after the children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe, the goddess of tears), and pelopium (from Pelops). The supposed element \"pelopium\" was later identified as a mixture of tantalum and niobium, and it was found that the niobium was identical to the columbium already discovered in 1801 by Hatchett.</p>\n<p>The differences between tantalum and niobium were demonstrated unequivocally in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, as well as by Louis J. Troost, who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in 1865. Further confirmation came from the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, in 1866, who proved that there were only two elements. These discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing articles about the so-called <i>ilmenium</i> until 1871. De Marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of tantalum in 1864, when he reduced tantalum chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Early investigators had been only able to produce impure tantalum, and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in 1903. Wires made with metallic tantalum were used for light bulb filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use.</p>\n<p>The name tantalum was derived from the name of the mythological Tantalus, the father of Niobe in Greek mythology. In the story, he had been punished after death by being condemned to stand knee-deep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head, both of which eternally <i>tantalized</i> him. (If he bent to drink the water, it drained below the level he could reach, and if he reached for the fruit, the branches moved out of his grasp.) Ekeberg wrote \"This metal I call <i>tantalum</i> … partly in allusion to its incapacity, when immersed in acid, to absorb any and be saturated.\"</p>\n<p>For decades, the commercial technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, a process that was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866. This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, and highly conductive of heat and electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150&nbsp;°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, as well as with a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017&nbsp;°C (boiling point 5458&nbsp;°C) is exceeded only by tungsten, rhenium and osmium for metals, and carbon.</p>\n<p>Tantalum exists in two crystalline phases, alpha and beta. The alpha phase is relatively ductile and soft; it has body-centered cubic structure (space group <i>Im3m</i>, lattice constant <i>a</i> = 0.33058&nbsp;nm), Knoop hardness 200–400 HN and electrical resistivity 15–60 µΩּcm. The beta phase is hard and brittle; its crystal symmetry is tetragonal (space group <i>P42/mnm</i>, <i>a</i> = 1.0194&nbsp;nm, <i>c</i> = 0.5313&nbsp;nm), Knoop hardness is 1000–1300 HN and electrical resistivity is relatively high at 170–210 µΩּcm. The beta phase is metastable and converts to the alpha phase upon heating to 750–775 °C. Bulk tantalum is almost entirely alpha phase, and the beta phase usually exists as thin films obtained by magnetron sputtering, chemical vapor deposition or electrochemical deposition from an eutectic molten salt solution.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Tantalum forms oxides with the oxidation states +5 (TaO) and +4 (TaO). The most stable oxidation state is +5, tantalum pentoxide. Tantalum pentoxide is the starting material for several tantalum compounds. The compounds are created by dissolving the pentoxide in basic hydroxide solutions or by melting it in another metal oxide. Such examples are lithium tantalate (LiTaO) and lanthanum tantalate (LaTaO). In the lithium tantalate, the tantalate ion TaO−\n3 does not occur; instead, this part of the formula represents linkage of TaO7−\n6 octahedra to form a three-dimensional perovskite framework; while the lanthanum tantalate contains lone TaO3−\n4 tetrahedral groups.</p>\n<p>The fluorides of tantalum can be used for its separation from niobium. Tantalum forms halogen compounds in the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3 of the type TaX\n5, TaX\n4, and TaX\n3, although multi core complexes and substoichiometric compounds are also known. Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0 °C and tantalum pentachloride (TaCl) is a white solid with a melting point of 247.4 °C. Tantalum pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional tantalum at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly hygroscopic tantalum tetrachloride (TaCl). While the trihalogen compounds can be obtained by reduction of the pentahalogenes with hydrogen, the dihalogen compounds do not exist. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals. Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as −1 have been reported in 2008.</p>\n<p>Similar to most other refractory metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides. Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes. Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide-graphite composite material that is one of the hardest materials ever synthesized. Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum-tungsten-copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys. There are two tantalum aluminides, TaAl and TaAl. These are stable, refractory, and reflective, and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of tantalum</div>\n<p>Natural tantalum consists of two isotopes: Ta (0.012%) and Ta (99.988%). Ta is a stable isotope. Ta (<i>m</i> denotes a metastable state) is predicted to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of Ta, beta decay to W, or electron capture to Hf. However, radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed. Only a lower limit on its half life of over 10 years has been set. The ground state of Ta has a half life of only 8 hours. Ta is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer (excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides). It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe, taking into account the elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of Ta in the natural mixture of isotopes (and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides).</p>\n<p>Tantalum has been examined theoretically as a \"salting\" material for nuclear weapons (cobalt is the better-known hypothetical salting material). An external shell of Ta would be irradiated by the intensive high-energy neutron flux from a hypothetical exploding nuclear weapon. This would transmute the tantalum into the radioactive isotope Ta, which has a half-life of 114.4 days and produces gamma rays with approximately 1.12 million electron-volts (MeV) of energy apiece, which would significantly increase the radioactivity of the nuclear fallout from the explosion for several months. Such \"salted\" weapons have never been built or tested, as far as is publicly known, and certainly never used as weapons.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<b>Tantalite</b>, Pilbara district, Australia</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tantalum is estimated to make up about 1&nbsp;ppm or 2&nbsp;ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only some of which are so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)TaO is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)O; when there is more Ta than Nb it is called tantalite and when there is more Nb than Ta is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.</p>\n<p>The primary mining of tantalum is in Australia, where the largest producer, Global Advanced Metals, formerly known as Talison Minerals, operates two mines in Western Australia, Greenbushes in the Southwest and Wodgina in the Pilbara region. The Wodgina mine was reopened in January 2011 after mining at the site was suspended in late-2008 due to the global financial crisis. Less than a year after it reopened, Global Advanced Metals announced that due to again \"... softening tantalum demand ...\", and other factors, tantalum mining operations were to cease at the end of February 2012. Wodgina produces a primary tantalum concentrate which is further upgraded at the Greenbushes operation before being sold to customers. Whereas the large-scale producers of niobium are in Brazil and Canada, the ore there also yields a small percentage of tantalum. Some other countries such as China, Ethiopia, and Mozambique mine ores with a higher percentage of tantalum, and they produce a significant percentage of the world's output of it. Tantalum is also produced in Thailand and Malaysia as a by-product of the tin mining there. During gravitational separation of the ores from placer deposits, not only is Cassiterite (SnO) found, but a small percentage of tantalite also included. The slag from the tin smelters then contains economically useful amounts of tantalum, which is leached from the slag. Future sources of supply of tantalum, in order of estimated size, are being explored in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Greenland, China, Mozambique, Canada, Australia, the United States, Finland, and Brazil.</p>\n<p>Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite–tantalite mineral from which columbium (i.e. niobium) and tantalum are extracted, can also be found in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002–2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.</p>\n<p>It is estimated that there is less than 50 years left of Tantalum resources, based on extraction at current rates, demonstrating the need for increased recycling.</p>\n<h2>Production and fabrication</h2>\n<p>Several steps are involved in the extraction of tantalum from tantalite. First, the mineral is crushed and concentrated by gravity separation. This is generally carried out near the mine site.</p>\n<h3>Chemical refining</h3>\n<p>Further processing by chemical separation is usually done by treating the ores with a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid at over 90 °C. These reagents dissolve the tantalum and niobium oxides to give complex fluorides, which can be separated from impurities and from each other:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>TaO + 14 HF → 2 H[TaF] + 5 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>NbO + 10 HF → 2 H[NbOF] + 3 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The first industrial-scale separation, developed by de Marignac, used the difference in solubility between the complex niobium and tantalum fluorides K[NbOF]•HO (potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate) and K[TaF] (potassium heptafluorotantalate) in water. Newer processes use the liquid extraction of the fluorides from aqueous solution by organic solvents such as cyclohexanone. The complex niobium and tantalum fluorides are extracted separately from the organic solvent with water, and either precipitated by the addition of potassium fluoride to produce a potassium fluoride complex, or precipitated with ammonia as the pentoxide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>H[TaF] + 2 KF → K[TaF]↓ + 2 HF</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 H[TaF] + 14 NHOH → TaO↓ + 14 NHF + 9 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The purified K[TaF] is generally treated by reduction with molten sodium to produce a coarse tantalum powder.</p>\n<p>In terms of fabrication, all welding of tantalum must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases. Tantalum is not solderable. Grinding tantalum is difficult, especially so for annealed tantalum. In the annealed condition, tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets.</p>\n<h3>Electrolysis</h3>\n<p>Electrolysis using a modified version of the Hall–Héroult process. Instead of requiring the input oxide and output metal to be in liquid form, tantalum electrolysis operates on non-liquid powdered oxides. The initial discovery came in 1997 when Cambridge University researchers immersed small samples of certain oxides in baths of molten salt and reduced the oxide with electric current. The cathode uses powdered metal oxide. The anode is made of carbon. The molten salt at 1,000 °C (1,830&nbsp;°F) is the electrolyte. The first refinery has enough capacity to supply 3-4% of annual global demand.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Electronics</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTantalum electrolytic capacitor</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The major use for tantalum, as the metal powder, is in the production of electronic components, mainly capacitors and some high-power resistors. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors exploit the tendency of tantalum to form a protective oxide surface layer, using tantalum powder, pressed into a pellet shape, as one \"plate\" of the capacitor, the oxide as the dielectric, and an electrolytic solution or conductive solid as the other \"plate\". Because the dielectric layer can be very thin (thinner than the similar layer in, for instance, an aluminium electrolytic capacitor), a high capacitance can be achieved in a small volume. Because of the size and weight advantages, tantalum capacitors are attractive for portable telephones, personal computers, and automotive electronics.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>Tantalum is also used to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, are strong and have good ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it is also used in making carbide tools for metalworking equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.</p>\n<p>Tantalum is inert against most acids except hydrofluoric acid and hot sulfuric acid, also hot alkaline solutions cause tantalum to corrode. This property makes it an ideal metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used in the production of ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>The high melting point and oxidation resistance lead to the use of the metal in the production of vacuum furnace parts. Tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistants parts, such as thermowells, valve bodies, and tantalum fasteners. Due to its high density, shaped charge and explosively formed penetrator liners have been constructed from tantalum. Tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and high melting point. It is also occasionally used in precious watches e.g. from Audemars Piguet, Hublot, Montblanc, Omega, and Panerai. Tantalum is also highly bioinert and is used as an orthopedic implant material. The elasticity of tantalum makes it a great material for hip replacements to avoid stress shielding. The oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for camera lenses.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n\n<p>Compounds containing tantalum are rarely encountered in the laboratory. The metal is highly biocompatible and is used for body implants and coatings, therefore attention may be focused on other elements or the physical nature of the chemical compound. A single study is the only reference in literature linking tantalum to local sarcomas. The study was quoted in IARC Monograph vol. 74 which includes the following \"Note to the reader\": \"Inclusion of an agent in the Monographs does not imply that it is a carcinogen, only that the published data have been examined.\"</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   Moseley, P.

  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Tungsten (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Tungsten</b>, also known as <b>wolfram</b>, is a chemical element with the chemical symbol <b>W</b> and atomic number 74. The word <i>tungsten</i> comes from the Swedish language <i>tung sten</i> directly translatable to <i>heavy stone</i>, though the name is <i>volfram</i> in Swedish to distinguish it from Scheelite, in Swedish alternatively named <i>tungsten</i>.</p>\n<p>A hard, rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined, tungsten is found naturally on Earth only in chemical compounds. It was identified as a new element in 1781, and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include wolframite and scheelite. The free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements. Also remarkable is its high density of 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Tungsten with minor amounts of impurities is often brittle and hard, making it difficult to work. However, very pure tungsten, though still hard, is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.</p>\n<p>Tungsten's many alloys have numerous applications, most notably in incandescent light bulb filaments, X-ray tubes (as both the filament and target), electrodes in TIG welding, and superalloys. Tungsten's hardness and high density give it military applications in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten compounds are most often used industrially as catalysts.</p>\n<p>Tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules, where it is used in a few species of bacteria and archaea. It is the heaviest element known to be used by any living organism. Tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism, and is somewhat toxic to animal life.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>In tungsten's raw form, it is a hard steel-grey metal that is often brittle and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of many steels), and becomes malleable enough that it can be worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering.</p>\n<p>Of all metals in pure form, tungsten has the highest melting point (3,422&nbsp;°C, 6,192&nbsp;°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1,650&nbsp;°C, 3,000&nbsp;°F) and the highest tensile strength. Tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons. Alloying small quantities of tungsten with steel greatly increases its toughness.</p>\n<p>Tungsten exists in two major crystalline forms: α and β. The former has a body-centered cubic structure and is the most stable form. The structure of the β phase is called A15 cubic; it is metastable, but can coexist with the α phase at ambient conditions owing to non-equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities. Contrary to the α phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the β form exhibits a columnar habit. The α phase has a three times lower electrical resistivity and a much lower superconducting transition temperature T than the β phase: ca. 0.015 K vs. 1–4 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermedicate T values. The T value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal (e.g. 7.9 K for W-Tc). Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low-temperature superconducting circuits.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of tungsten</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring tungsten consists of five isotopes whose half-lives are so long that they can be considered stable. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only W has been observed to do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×10 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of W in one gram of natural tungsten per year. The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives to be</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>W, <i>T</i> &gt; 1.7×10 years</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>W, <i>T</i> &gt; 8×10 years</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>W, <i>T</i> &gt; 1.8×10 years</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>W, <i>T</i> &gt; 4.1×10 years</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Another 30 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized, the most stable of which are W with a half-life of 121.2&nbsp;days, W with a half-life of 75.1&nbsp;days, W with a half-life of 69.4&nbsp;days, W with a half-life of 21.6&nbsp;days, and W with a half-life of 23.72 h. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3&nbsp;hours, and most of these have half-lives below 8&nbsp;minutes. Tungsten also has 4&nbsp;meta states, the most stable being W (<i>T</i> 6.4&nbsp;minutes).</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<div><i>Main article: Tungsten compounds</i></div>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Elemental tungsten resists attack by oxygen, acids, and alkalis.</p>\n<p>The most common formal oxidation state of tungsten is +6, but it exhibits all oxidation states from −2 to +6. Tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow tungstic oxide, WO, which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions, WO2−\n4.</p>\n<p>Tungsten carbides (WC and WC) are produced by heating powdered tungsten with carbon. WC is resistant to chemical attack, although it reacts strongly with chlorine to form tungsten hexachloride (WCl).</p>\n<p>In aqueous solution, tungstate gives the heteropoly acids and polyoxometalate anions under neutral and acidic conditions. As tungstate is progressively treated with acid, it first yields the soluble, metastable \"paratungstate A\" anion, W\n7O6–\n24, which over time converts to the less soluble \"paratungstate B\" anion, H\n2W\n12O10–\n42. Further acidification produces the very soluble metatungstate anion, H\n2W\n12O6–\n40, after which equilibrium is reached. The metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten-oxygen octahedra known as the Keggin anion. Many other polyoxometalate anions exist as metastable species. The inclusion of a different atom such as phosphorus in place of the two central hydrogens in metatungstate produces a wide variety of heteropoly acids, such as phosphotungstic acid HPWO.</p>\n<p>Tungsten trioxide can form intercalation compounds with alkali metals. These are known as <i>bronzes</i>; an example is sodium tungsten bronze.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<p>Tungsten is found in the minerals wolframite (iron-manganese tungstate, (Fe,Mn)WO), scheelite (calcium tungstate, (CaWO), ferberite (FeWO) and hübnerite (MnWO). China produced 51,000 tonnes of tungsten concentrate in 2009, which was 83% of the world output. In the prelude to WWII China's production of tungsten played a role as China could use this leverage to demand material assistance from the US government. Most of the remaining production originated from Russia (2,500 t), Canada (1,964 t), Bolivia (1,023 t), Austria (900 t), Portugal (900 t), Thailand (600 t), Brazil (500 t), Peru (500 t) and Rwanda (500 t). Tungsten is also considered to be a conflict mineral due to the unethical mining practices observed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>\n<h3>Biological role</h3>\n<p>Tungsten, at atomic number 74, is the heaviest element known to be biologically functional, with the next heaviest being iodine (<i>Z</i> = 53). It is used by some bacteria, but not in eukaryotes. For example, enzymes called oxidoreductases use tungsten similarly to molybdenum by using it in a tungsten-pterin complex with molybdopterin (molybdopterin, despite its name, does not contain molybdenum, but may complex with either molybdenum or tungsten in use by living organisms). Tungsten-using enzymes typically reduce carboxylic acids to aldehydes. The tungsten oxidoreductases may also catalyse oxidations. The first tungsten-requiring enzyme to be discovered also requires selenium, and in this case the tungsten-selenium pair may function analogously to the molybdenum-sulfur pairing of some molybdenum cofactor-requiring enzymes. One of the enzymes in the oxidoreductase family which sometimes employ tungsten (bacterial formate dehydrogenase H) is known to use a selenium-molybdenum version of molybdopterin. Although a tungsten-containing xanthine dehydrogenase from bacteria has been found to contain tungsten-molydopterin and also non-protein bound selenium, a tungsten-selenium molybdopterin complex has not been definitively described.</p>\n<p>In soil, tungsten metal oxidizes to the tungstate anion. It can be selectively or non-selectively imported by some prokaryotic organisms and may substitute for molybdate in certain enzymes. Its effect on the action of these enzymes is in some cases inhibitory and in others positive. The soil's chemistry determines how the tungsten polymerizes; alkaline soils cause monomeric tungstates; acidic soils cause polymeric tungstates.</p>\n<p>Sodium tungstate and lead have been studied for their effect on earthworms. Lead was found to be lethal at low levels and sodium tungstate was much less toxic, but the tungstate completely inhibited their reproductive ability.</p>\n<p>Tungsten has been studied as a biological copper metabolic antagonist, in a role similar to the action of molybdenum. It has been found that tetrathiotungstates may be used as biological copper chelation chemicals, similar to the tetrathiomolybdates.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested that it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, in Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.</p>\n<p>In World War II, tungsten played a significant role in background political dealings. Portugal, as the main European source of the element, was put under pressure from both sides, because of its deposits of wolframite ore at Panasqueira. Tungsten's resistance to high temperatures and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry.</p>\n<h3>Etymology</h3>\n<p>The name \"tungsten\" (from the Nordic <i>tung sten</i>, meaning \"<i>heavy stone</i>\") is used in English, French, and many other languages as the name of the element. Tungsten was the old Swedish name for the mineral scheelite. The other name \"wolfram\" (or \"volfram\"), used for example in most European (especially Germanic and Slavic) languages, is derived from the mineral wolframite, and this is also the origin of its chemical symbol, <b>W</b>. The name \"wolframite\" is derived from German \"<i>wolf rahm</i>\" (\"wolf soot\" or \"wolf cream\"), the name given to tungsten by Johan Gottschalk Wallerius in 1747. This, in turn, derives from \"<i>Lupi spuma</i>\", the name Georg Agricola used for the element in 1546, which translates into English as \"wolf's froth\" or \"cream\" (the etymology is not entirely certain), and is a reference to the large amounts of tin consumed by the mineral during its extraction.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWolframite, scale in cm</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTungsten output in 2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>About 61,300 tonnes of tungsten concentrates were produced in the year 2009. Tungsten is extracted from its ores in several stages. The ore is eventually converted to tungsten(VI) oxide (WO), which is heated with hydrogen or carbon to produce powdered tungsten. Because of tungsten's high melting point, it is not commercially feasible to cast tungsten ingots. Instead, powdered tungsten is mixed with small amounts of powdered nickel or other metals, and sintered. During the sintering process, the nickel diffuses into the tungsten, producing an alloy.</p>\n<p>Tungsten can also be extracted by hydrogen reduction of WF:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>WF + 3 H → W + 6 HF</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>or pyrolytic decomposition:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>WF → W + 3 F (ΔH = +)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Tungsten is not traded as a futures contract and cannot be tracked on exchanges like the London Metal Exchange. The prices are usually quoted for tungsten concentrate or WO. If converted to the metal equivalent, they were about US$19,000 per tonne in 2009.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nClose-up of a tungsten filament inside a halogen lamp</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTungsten carbide ring (jewelry)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Approximately half of the tungsten is consumed for the production of hard materials – namely tungsten carbide – with the remaining major use being in alloys and steels. Less than 10% is used in other chemical compounds.</p>\n<h3>Hard materials</h3>\n<p>Tungsten is mainly used in the production of hard materials based on tungsten carbide, one of the hardest carbides, with a melting point of 2770&nbsp;°C. WC is an efficient electrical conductor, but WC is less so. WC is used to make wear-resistant abrasives and cutters and knives for drills, circular saws, milling and turning tools used by the metalworking, woodworking, mining, petroleum and construction industries and accounts for about 60% of current tungsten consumption.</p>\n<p>The jewelry industry makes rings of sintered tungsten carbide, tungsten carbide/metal composites, and also metallic tungsten. Sometimes manufacturers or retailers refer to tungsten carbide as a metal, but it is a ceramic. Because of tungsten carbide's hardness, rings made of this material are extremely abrasion resistant, and will hold a burnished finish longer than rings made of metallic tungsten. Tungsten carbide rings are brittle, however, and may crack under a sharp blow.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>The hardness and density of tungsten are applied in obtaining heavy metal alloys. A good example is high speed steel, which can contain as much as 18% tungsten. Tungsten's high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles, for example in the UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile. Superalloys containing tungsten, such as Hastelloy and Stellite, are used in turbine blades and wear-resistant parts and coatings.</p>\n<h3>Armaments</h3>\n<p>Tungsten, usually alloyed with nickel and iron or cobalt to form heavy alloys, is used in kinetic energy penetrators as an alternative to depleted uranium, in applications where uranium's radioactivity is problematic, or where uranium's additional pyrophoric properties are not required (for example, in ordinary small arms bullets designed to penetrate body armor). Similarly, tungsten alloys have also been used in cannon shells, grenades and missiles, to create supersonic shrapnel. Tungsten has also been used in Dense Inert Metal Explosives, which use it as dense powder to reduce collateral damage while increasing the lethality of explosives within a small radius.</p>\n<h3>Chemical applications</h3>\n<p>Tungsten(IV) sulfide is a high temperature lubricant and is a component of catalysts for hydrodesulfurization. MoS is more commonly used for such applications.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe glass bulb of the lightbulb has been opened, causing the inert gas inside to escape. When turned on, the tungsten filament burns with a flame, due to oxygen entering the light bulb. The light bulb was screwed into a socket, which was replaced with the lamp base using image processing.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Tungsten oxides are used in ceramic glazes and calcium/magnesium tungstates are used widely in fluorescent lighting. Crystal tungstates are used as scintillation detectors in nuclear physics and nuclear medicine. Other salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and tanning industries.</p>\n<p>Tungsten oxide (WO) is incorporated into selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts found in coal-fired power plants. These catalysts convert nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen (N) and water (HO) using ammonia (NH). The tungsten oxide helps with the physical strength of the catalyst and extends catalyst life.</p>\n<h3>Niche uses</h3>\n<p>Applications requiring its high density include weights, counterweights, ballast keels for yachts, tail ballast for commercial aircraft, and as ballast in race cars for NASCAR and Formula One; depleted uranium is also used for these purposes, due to similarly high density. 75-kg blocks of tungsten were used as \"cruise balance mass devices\" on the entry vehicle portion of the 2012 Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. It is an ideal material to use as a dolly for riveting, where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar. High-density alloys of tungsten with nickel, copper or iron are used in high-quality darts (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for fishing lures (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly). Some types of strings for musical instruments are wound with tungsten wires.</p>\n<p>Sodium tungstate is used in Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent, a mixture of different chemicals used in the \"Lowry Assay\" for protein content analysis.</p>\n<h3>Gold substitution</h3>\n<p>Its density, similar to that of gold, allows tungsten to be used in jewelry as an alternative to gold or platinum. Metallic tungsten is harder than gold alloys (though not as hard as tungsten carbide), and is hypoallergenic, making it useful for rings that will resist scratching, especially in designs with a brushed finish.</p>\n<p>Because the density is so similar to gold (tungsten is only 0.36% less dense), tungsten can also be used in counterfeiting of gold bars, such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold, which has been observed since the 1980s, or taking an existing gold bar, drilling holes, and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods. The densities are not exactly the same, and other properties of gold and tungsten differ, but gold-plated tungsten will pass superficial tests.</p>\n<p>Gold-plated tungsten is available commercially from China (the main source of tungsten), both in jewelry and as bars.</p>\n<h3>Electronics</h3>\n<p>Because it retains its strength at high temperatures and has a high melting point, elemental tungsten is used in many high-temperature applications, such as light bulb, cathode-ray tube, and vacuum tube filaments, heating elements, and rocket engine nozzles. Its high melting point also makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high-temperature uses such as electrical, heating, and welding applications, notably in the gas tungsten arc welding process (also called tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding).</p>\n<p>Because of its conductive properties and relative chemical inertness, tungsten is also used in electrodes, and in the emitter tips in electron-beam instruments that use field emission guns, such as electron microscopes. In electronics, tungsten is used as an interconnect material in integrated circuits, between the silicon dioxide dielectric material and the transistors. It is used in metallic films, which replace the wiring used in conventional electronics with a coat of tungsten (or molybdenum) on silicon.</p>\n<p>The electronic structure of tungsten makes it one of the main sources for X-ray targets, and also for shielding from high-energy radiations (such as in the radiopharmaceutical industry for shielding radioactive samples of FDG). It is also used in gamma imaging as a material from which coded apertures are made, due to its excellent shielding properties. Tungsten powder is used as a filler material in plastic composites, which are used as a nontoxic substitute for lead in bullets, shot, and radiation shields. Since this element's thermal expansion is similar to borosilicate glass, it is used for making glass-to-metal seals.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Because tungsten is rare and its compounds are generally inert, the effects of tungsten on the environment are limited. The median lethal dose LD depends strongly on the animal and the method of administration and varies between 59&nbsp;mg/kg (intravenous, rabbit) and 5000&nbsp;mg/kg (tungsten metal powder, intraperitoneal, rats).</p>\n<h2>Patent claim</h2>\n<p>Tungsten is unique amongst the elements in that it has been the subject of patent proceedings. In 1928, a US court rejected General Electric's attempt to patent it, overturning U.S. Patent 1,082,933 granted in 1913 to William D. Coolidge.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Field emission gun</li>\n<li>Tungsten oxide</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ \"Why does Tungsten not 'Kick' up an electron from the s sublevel&nbsp;?\".

  "title": "Rhenium",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For the Parliament album, see Rhenium (album).</div>\n\n<p><b>Rhenium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Re</b> and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. With an <i>estimated</i> average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. The free element has the third-highest melting point and highest boiling point of any element. Rhenium resembles manganese chemically and is obtained as a by-product of molybdenum and copper ore's extraction and refinement. Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.</p>\n<p>Discovered in 1925, rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered. It was named after the river Rhine in Europe.</p>\n<p>Nickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in the combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of jet engines. These alloys contain up to 6% rhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element, with the chemical industry's catalytic uses being next-most important. Because of the low availability relative to demand, rhenium is among the most expensive of metals, with an average price of approximately US$4,575 per kilogram (US$142.30 per troy ounce) as of August 2011; it is also of critical strategic military importance, for its use in high performance military jet and rocket engines.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Rhenium (Latin: Rhenus meaning: \"Rhine\") was the last element to be discovered having a stable isotope (other new radioactive elements have been discovered in nature since then, such as neptunium and plutonium). The existence of a yet undiscovered element at this position in the periodic table had been first predicted by Dmitry Mendeleev. Other calculated information was obtained by Henry Moseley in 1914. It is generally considered to have been discovered by Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke, and Otto Berg in Germany. In 1925 they reported that they detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral columbite. They also found rhenium in gadolinite and molybdenite. In 1928 they were able to extract 1 g of the element by processing 660&nbsp;kg of molybdenite.It was estimated in 1968 that 75% of the rhenium metal in the United States was used for research and the development of refractory metal alloys. It took several years from that point on before the super alloys became widely used.</p>\n<p>In 1908, Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa announced that he discovered the 43rd element and named it <i>nipponium</i> (Np) after Japan (<i>Nippon</i> in Japanese). However, later analysis indicated the presence of rhenium (element 75), not element 43. The symbol Np was later used for the element neptunium.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Rhenium is a silvery-white metal with one of the highest melting points of all elements, exceeded by only tungsten and carbon. It is also one of the densest, exceeded only by platinum, iridium and osmium. Rhenium has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a = 276.1 pm and c = 445.6 pm.</p>\n<p>Its usual commercial form is a powder, but this element can be consolidated by pressing and sintering in a vacuum or hydrogen atmosphere. This procedure yields a compact solid having a density above 90% of the density of the metal. When annealed this metal is very ductile and can be bent, coiled, or rolled. Rhenium-molybdenum alloys are superconductive at 10 K; tungsten-rhenium alloys are also superconductive around 4–8 K, depending on the alloy. Rhenium metal superconducts at 1.697 ± 0.006 K. </p>\n<p>In bulk form and at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the element resists alkalis, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, dilute, but not concentrated nitric acid, and aqua regia.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of rhenium</div>\n<p>Rhenium has one stable isotope, rhenium-185, which nevertheless occurs in minority abundance, a situation found only in two other elements (indium and tellurium). Naturally occurring rhenium is 37.4% Re, which is stable, and 62.6% Re, which is unstable but has a very long half-life (~10 years). This lifetime can be greatly affected by the charge state of rhenium atom. The beta decay of Re is used for rhenium-osmium dating of ores. The available energy for this beta decay (2.6 keV) is one of the lowest known among all radionuclides. The isotope rhenium-186m is notable as being one of the longest lived metastable isotopes with a half-life of around 200,000 years. There are twenty-five other recognized radioactive isotopes of rhenium.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>See also category: Rhenium compounds</div>\n<p>Rhenium compounds are known for all nine oxidation states between −1 and +7. The oxidation states +7, +6, +4, and +2 are the most common. Rhenium is most available commercially as salts of perrhenate, including sodium and ammonium perrhenates. These are white, water-soluble compounds.</p>\n<h4>Halides and oxyhalides</h4>\n<p>The most common rhenium chlorides are ReCl, ReCl, ReCl, and ReCl. The structures of these compounds often feature extensive Re-Re bonding, which is characteristic of this metal in oxidation states lower than VII. Salts of [ReCl] feature a quadruple metal-metal bond. Although the highest rhenium chloride features Re(VI), fluorine gives the d Re(VII) derivative rhenium heptafluoride. Bromides and iodides of rhenium are also well known.</p>\n<p>Like tungsten and molybdenum, with which it shares chemical similarities, rhenium forms a variety of oxyhalides. The oxychlorides are most common, and include ReOCl, ReOCl.</p>\n<h4>Oxides and sulfides</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPerrhenic acid adopts an unconventional structure.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The most common oxide is the volatile colourless ReO, which adopts a molecular structure, unlike most metal oxides. The d1 species ReO adopts a defect perovskite structure. Other oxides include ReO, ReO, and ReO. The sulfides are ReS and ReS. Perrhenate salts can be converted to tetrathioperrhenate by the action of ammonium hydrosulfide.</p>\n<h4>Other compounds</h4>\n<p>Rhenium diboride (ReB) is a hard compound having the hardness similar to that of tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.</p>\n<h4>Organorhenium compounds</h4>\n<div>Main article: Organorhenium chemistry</div>\n<p>Dirhenium decacarbonyl is the most common entry to organorhenium chemistry. Its reduction with sodium amalgam gives Na[Re(CO)] with rhenium in the formal oxidation state −1.

Rhenium is probably not found free in nature (its possible natural occurrence is uncertain), but occurs in amounts up to 0.2% in the mineral molybdenite (which is primarily molybdenum disulfide), the major commercial source, although single molybdenite samples with up to 1.88% have been found. Chile has the world's largest rhenium reserves, part of the copper ore deposits, and was the leading producer as of 2005. It was only recently that the first rhenium mineral was found and described (in 1994), a rhenium sulfide mineral (ReS) condensing from a fumarole on Russia's Kudriavy volcano, Iturup island, in the Kurile Islands. Kudryavy discharges up to 20–60&nbsp;kg rhenium per year mostly in the form of rhenium disulfide. Named rheniite, this rare mineral commands high prices among collectors.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAmmonium perrhenate</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Commercial rhenium is extracted from molybdenum roaster-flue gas obtained from copper-sulfide ores. Some molybdenum ores contain 0.001% to 0.2% rhenium. Rhenium(VII) oxide and perrhenic acid readily dissolve in water; they are leached from flue dusts and gasses and extracted by precipitating with potassium or ammonium chloride as the perrhenate salts, and purified by recrystallization. Total world production is between 40 and 50 tons/year; the main producers are in Chile, the United States, Peru, and Kazakhstan. Recycling of used Pt-Re catalyst and special alloys allow the recovery of another 10 tons per year. Prices for the metal rose rapidly in early 2008, from $1000–$2000 per kg in 2003–2006 to over $10,000 in February 2008. The metal form is prepared by reducing ammonium perrhenate with hydrogen at high temperatures:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 NHReO + 7 H → 2 Re + 8 HO + 2 NH</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Pratt &amp; Whitney F-100 engine uses rhenium-containing second-generation superalloys</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Rhenium is added to high-temperature superalloys that are used to make jet engine parts, using 70% of the worldwide rhenium production. Another major application is in platinum-rhenium catalysts, which are primarily used in making lead-free, high-octane gasoline.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>The nickel-based superalloys have improved creep strength with the addition of rhenium. The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of rhenium. Second generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines of the F-16 and F-15, while the newer single-crystal third generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the F-22 and F-35 engines. Rhenium is also used in the superalloys, such as CMSX-4 (2nd gen) and CMSX-10 (3rd gen) that are used in industrial gas turbine engines like the GE 7FA. Rhenium can cause superalloys to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable TCP (topologically close packed) phases. In 4th and 5th generation superalloys, ruthenium is used to avoid this effect. Among others the new superalloys are EPM-102 (with 3% Ru) and TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), both containing 6% rhenium, as well as TMS-138 and TMS-174.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCFM International CFM56 jet engine still with blades made with 3% rhenium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>For 2006, the consumption is given as 28% for General Electric, 28% Rolls-Royce plc and 12% Pratt &amp; Whitney, all for superalloys, while the use for catalysts only accounts for 14% and the remaining applications use 18%. In 2006, 77% of the rhenium consumption in the United States was in alloys. The rising demand for military jet engines and the constant supply made it necessary to develop superalloys with a lower rhenium content. For example the newer CFM International CFM56 high-pressure turbine (HPT) blades will use Rene N515 with a rhenium content of 1.5% instead of Rene N5 with 3%.</p>\n<p>Rhenium improves the properties of tungsten. Tungsten-rhenium alloys are more ductile at low temperature, allowing them to be more easily machined. The high-temperature stability is also improved. The effect increases with the rhenium concentration, and therefore tungsten alloys are produced with up to 27% of Re, which is the solubility limit. One application for the tungsten-rhenium alloys is X-ray sources. The high melting point of both compounds, together with the high atomic mass, makes them stable against the prolonged electron impact. Rhenium tungsten alloys are also applied as thermocouples to measure temperatures up to 2200 °C.</p>\n<p>The high temperature stability, low vapor pressure, good wear resistance and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium are useful in self-cleaning electrical contacts. In particular, the discharge occurring during the switching oxidizes the contacts. However, rhenium oxide ReO has poor stability (sublimes at ~360 °C) and therefore is removed during the discharge.</p>\n<p>Rhenium has a high melting point and a low vapor pressure similar to tantalum and tungsten. Therefore, rhenium filaments exhibit a higher stability if the filament is operated not in vacuum, but in oxygen-containing atmosphere. Those filaments are widely used in mass spectrometers, in ion gauges and in photoflash lamps in photography.</p>\n<h3>Catalysts</h3>\n<p>Rhenium in the form of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as catalyst for catalytic reforming, which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery naphthas with low octane ratings into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium. The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally ReO on alumina is used for this process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>The isotopes Re and Re are radioactive and are used for treatment of liver cancer. They both have similar penetration depth in tissue (5&nbsp;mm for Re and 11&nbsp;mm for Re), but Re has advantage of longer lifetime (90 hours vs. 17 hours).</p>\n<p>Re is also being used experimentally in a novel treatment of pancreatic cancer where it is delivered by means of the bacterium <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. </p>\n<p>Related by periodic trends, rhenium has a similar chemistry with technetium; work done to label rhenium onto target compounds can often be translated to technetium. This is useful for radiopharmacy, where it is difficult to work with technetium – especially the 99m isotope used in medicine – due to its expense and short half-life.</p>\n<h2>Precaution</h2>\n<p>Very little is known about the toxicity of rhenium and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts. Soluble salts, such as the rhenium halides or perrhenates, could be hazardous due to elements other than rhenium or due to rhenium itself. Only a few compounds of rhenium have been tested for their acute toxicity; two examples are potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride, which were injected as a solution into rats. The perrhenate had an LD value of 2800&nbsp;mg/kg after seven days (this is very low toxicity, similar to that of table salt) and the rhenium trichloride showed LD of 280&nbsp;mg/kg.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^ \"Rhenium\".

  "html": "\n<div>For album by Parliament, see Osmium (album).</div>\n<p><b>Osmium</b> (from Greek <i>osme</i> (ὀσμή) meaning \"smell\") is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Os</b> and atomic number 76. It is a hard, brittle, bluish-white transition metal in the platinum family and is the densest naturally occurring element, with a density of 22.59&nbsp;g/cm. It is found in nature as an alloy, mostly in platinum ores; its alloys with platinum, iridium, and other platinum group metals are employed in fountain pen tips, electrical contacts, and other applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOsmium, remelted pellet</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Osmium has a blue-gray tint and is the densest stable element, slightly denser than iridium. Calculations of density from the X-ray diffraction data may produce the most reliable data for these elements, giving a value of 22.562±0.009&nbsp;g/cm for iridium versus 22.587±0.009&nbsp;g/cm for osmium. The high density of osmium is a consequence of the lanthanide contraction.</p>\n<p>Osmium is a hard but brittle metal that remains lustrous even at high temperatures. It has a very low compressibility. Correspondingly, its bulk modulus is extremely high, reported between 395 and 462&nbsp;GPa, which rivals that of diamond (443&nbsp;GPa). The hardness of osmium is moderately high at 4&nbsp;GPa. Because of its hardness, brittleness, low vapor pressure (the lowest of the platinum group metals), and very high melting point (the fourth highest of all elements), solid osmium is difficult to machine, form or work.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<div>See also: Category:Osmium compounds</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Osmium forms compounds with oxidation states ranging from −2 to +8. The most common oxidation states are +2, +3, +4, and +8. The +8 oxidation state is notable for being the highest attained by any chemical element and, aside from osmium, is encountered only in xenon, ruthenium, hassium, iridium, and plutonium (unstable). The oxidation states −1 and −2 represented by the two reactive compounds Na\n2[Os\n4(CO)\n13] and Na\n2[Os(CO)\n4] are used in the synthesis of osmium cluster compounds.</p>\n<p>The most common compound exhibiting the +8 oxidation state is osmium tetroxide. This toxic compound is formed when powdered osmium is exposed to air, and is a very volatile, water-soluble, pale yellow, crystalline solid with a strong smell. Osmium powder has the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide. Osmium tetroxide forms red osmates OsO\n4(OH)2−\n2 upon reaction with a base. With ammonia, it forms the nitrido-osmates OsO\n3N−. Osmium tetroxide boils at 130&nbsp;°C and is a powerful oxidizing agent. By contrast, osmium dioxide (OsO) is black, non-volatile, and much less reactive and toxic.</p>\n<p>Only two osmium compounds have major applications: osmium tetroxide for staining tissue in electron microscopy and for the oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis, and the non-volatile osmates for organic oxidation reactions.</p>\n<p>Osmium pentafluoride (OsF) is known, but osmium trifluoride (OsF) has not yet been synthesized. The lower oxidation states are stabilized by the larger halogens, so that the trichloride, tribromide, triiodide, and even diiodide are known. The oxidation state +1 is known only for osmium iodide (OsI), whereas several carbonyl complexes of osmium, such as triosmium dodecacarbonyl (Os\n3(CO)\n12), represent oxidation state 0.</p>\n<p>In general, the lower oxidation states of osmium are stabilized by ligands that are good σ-donors (such as amines) and π-acceptors (heterocycles containing nitrogen). The higher oxidation states are stabilized by strong σ- and π-donors, such as O2− and N3−.</p>\n<p>Despite its broad range of compounds in numerous oxidation states, osmium in bulk form at ordinary temperatures and pressures resists attack by all acids and alkalis, and even aqua regia.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of osmium</div>\n<p>Osmium has seven naturally occurring isotopes, six of which are stable: 184Os, 187Os, 188Os, 189Os, 190Os, and (most abundant) 192Os. 186Os undergoes alpha decay with such a long half-life ((2.0±1.1)×10&nbsp;years) that for practical purposes it can be considered stable. Alpha decay is predicted for all seven naturally occurring isotopes, but due to very long half-lives, it has been observed only for 186Os. It is predicted that 184Os and 192Os can undergo double beta decay but this radioactivity has not been observed yet.</p>\n<p>187Os is the daughter of 187Re (half-life 4.56×10&nbsp;years) and is used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as meteoric rocks (see rhenium-osmium dating). It has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the mantle roots of continental cratons. This decay is a reason why rhenium-rich minerals are abnormally rich in 187Os. However, the most notable application of Os in dating has been in conjunction with iridium, to analyze the layer of shocked quartz along the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary that marks the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Osmium was discovered in 1803 by Smithson Tennant and William Hyde Wollaston in London, England. The discovery of osmium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group. Platinum reached Europe as <i>platina</i> (\"small silver\"), first encountered in the late 17th century in silver mines around the Chocó Department, in Colombia. The discovery that this metal was not an alloy, but a distinct new element, was published in 1748. Chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) to create soluble salts. They always observed a small amount of a dark, insoluble residue. Joseph Louis Proust thought that the residue was graphite. Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough material for further experiments.</p>\n<p>In 1803, Smithson Tennant analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal. Vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide, which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named <i>ptene</i>, from the Greek word πτηνος (ptènos) for winged. However, Tennant, who had the advantage of a much larger amount of residue, continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue, iridium and osmium. He obtained a yellow solution (probably of <i>cis</i>–[Os(OH)O]) by reactions with sodium hydroxide at red heat. After acidification he was able to distill the formed OsO. He named osmium after Greek <i>osme</i> meaning \"a smell\", because of the ashen and smoky smell of the volatile osmium tetroxide. Discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the Royal Society on June 21, 1804.</p>\n<p>Uranium and osmium were early successful catalysts in the Haber process, the nitrogen fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia, giving enough yield to make the process economically successful. At the time, a group at BASF led by Carl Bosch bought most of the world's supply of osmium to use as a catalyst. Shortly thereafter, in 1908, cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants, removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium.</p>\n<p>Nowadays osmium is obtained primarily from the processing of platinum and nickel ores.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNative platinum containing traces of the other platinum group metals</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Osmium is the least abundant stable element in the Earth's crust with an average mass fraction of 0.05&nbsp;ppb in the continental crust.</p>\n<p>Osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys; especially the iridium–osmium alloys, osmiridium (osmium rich), and iridiosmium (iridium rich). In the nickel and copper deposits, the platinum group metals occur as sulfides (i.e., (Pt,Pd)S)), tellurides (e.g., PtBiTe), antimonides (e.g., PdSb), and arsenides (e.g., PtAs); in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium. As with all of the platinum group metals, osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper.</p>\n<p>Within the Earth's crust, osmium, like iridium, is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked from one of the former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld igneous complex in South Africa, though the large copper–nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of osmium. Smaller reserves can be found in the United States. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum group metals. The second large alluvial deposit was found in the Ural Mountains, Russia, which is still mined.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOsmium crystals, grown by chemical vapor transport.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Osmium is obtained commercially as a by-product from nickel and copper mining and processing. During electrorefining of copper and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals, together with non-metallic elements such as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as <i>anode mud</i>, which forms the starting material for their extraction. In order to separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid. Osmium, ruthenium, rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum, gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia, leaving a solid residue. Rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate. The insoluble residue, containing Ru, Os and Ir, is treated with sodium oxide, in which Ir is insoluble, producing water-soluble Ru and Os salts. After oxidation to the volatile oxides, RuO\n4 is separated from OsO\n4 by precipitation of (NH)RuCl with ammonium chloride.</p>\n<p>After it is dissolved, osmium is separated from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. The first method is similar to the procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.</p>\n<p>Neither the producers nor the United States Geological Survey published any production amounts for osmium. Estimations of the United States consumption date published from 1971, which gives a consumption in the United States of 2000&nbsp;troy ounces (62&nbsp;kg), would suggest that the production is still less than 1&nbsp;ton per year. In 2012, the estimated US production of osmium was 75&nbsp;kg.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide, osmium is rarely used in its pure state, and is instead often alloyed with other metals. Those alloys are utilized in high-wear applications. Osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and, along with other platinum group metals, are used in the tips of fountain pens, instrument pivots, and electrical contacts, as they can resist wear from frequent operation. They were also used for the tips of phonograph styli during the late 78 rpm and early \"LP\" and \"45\" record era, circa 1945 to 1955. Although very durable compared to steel and chromium needle points, osmium alloy tips wore out far more rapidly than competing but costlier sapphire and diamond tips and were discontinued.</p>\n<p>Osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprint detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds, and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.</p>\n<p>The tetroxide and a related compound, potassium osmate, are important oxidants for chemical synthesis, despite being very poisonous. For the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, which uses osmate for the conversion of a double bond into a vicinal diol, Karl Barry Sharpless won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001. Apparently, OsO is very expensive for this use, so KMnO is often used instead, even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent.</p>\n<p>In 1898 an Austrian chemist, Auer von Welsbach, developed the Oslamp with a filament made of osmium, which he introduced commercially in 1902. After only a few years, osmium was replaced by the more stable metal tungsten. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, and using it in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps.</p>\n<p>The light bulb manufacturer Osram (founded in 1906 when three German companies, Auer-Gesellschaft, AEG and Siemens &amp; Halske, combined their lamp production facilities) derived its name from the elements of <b>os</b>mium and Wolf<b>ram</b> (the latter is German for tungsten).</p>\n<p>Like palladium, powdered osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms. This could make osmium a potential candidate for a metal hydride battery electrode. However, osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide, the most common battery electrolyte.</p>\n<p>Osmium has high reflectivity in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but it soon became clear that the oxygen radicals in the low earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.</p>\n<p>The only known clinical use of osmium appears to be for synovectomy in arthritic patients in Scandinavia. It involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide (OsO) which is a highly toxic compound. The lack of reports of long-term side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible, although this depends on the osmium compound administered. In 2011, osmium(VI) and osmium(II)  compounds were reported to show anticancer activity <i>in vivo</i>, it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Electron micrograph of (organic) plant tissue without (top) and with (bottom) OsO staining</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The Sharpless dihydroxylation:<br>\nR=Largest substituent; R=Medium-sized substituent; R=Smallest substituent</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Post-flight appearance of Os, Ag, and Au mirrors from the front (left images) and rear panels of Space Shuttle. Blackening reveals oxidation due to irradiation by oxygen atoms.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Finely divided metallic osmium is pyrophoric. Osmium reacts with oxygen at room temperature forming volatile osmium tetroxide. Some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present. This makes osmium tetroxide the main source of contact with the environment.</p>\n<p>Osmium tetroxide is highly volatile and penetrates skin readily, and is very toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. Airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage, and should therefore be used in a fume hood. Osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils, such as corn oil.</p>\n<h2>Price</h2>\n<p>Osmium is usually sold as a 99% pure powder. Like other precious metals, it is measured by troy weight and by grams. Its price in 2012 was about $400 per troy ounce (or about $13 per gram), depending on the quantity and its supplier.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^ Hammond \"Osmium\", C.

  "title": "Iridium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with Indium.</div>\n<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Iridium (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Iridium</b> is the chemical element with symbol <b>Ir</b> and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum family, iridium is the second-densest element (after osmium) and is the most corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000&nbsp;°C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.</p>\n<p>Iridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named the iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust, with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes. Ir and Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.</p>\n<p>The most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine, though iridium also forms a number of organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis, and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-end spark plugs, crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the chloralkali process. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators.</p>\n<p>Iridium is found in meteorites with an abundance much higher than its average abundance in the Earth's crust. For this reason the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary gave rise to the Alvarez hypothesis that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 65&nbsp;million years ago. It is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n1 troy ounce (31&nbsp;g) of arc-melted iridium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A member of the platinum group metals, iridium is white, resembling platinum, but with a slight yellowish cast. Because of its hardness, brittleness, and very high melting point, solid iridium is difficult to machine, form, or work, and thus powder metallurgy is commonly employed instead. It is the only metal to maintain good mechanical properties in air at temperatures above 1600&nbsp;°C. Iridium has a very high boiling point (10th among all elements) and becomes a superconductor at temperatures below 0.14&nbsp;K.</p>\n<p>Iridium's modulus of elasticity is the second-highest among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium. This, together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate the high degree of stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.</p>\n<p>The measured density of iridium is only slightly lower (by about 0.12%) than that of osmium, the densest element known. There had been some ambiguity regarding which of the two elements was denser, due to the small size of the difference in density and difficulties in measuring it accurately, but, with increased accuracy in factors used for calculating density X-ray crystallographic data yielded densities of 22.56&nbsp;g/cm for iridium and 22.59&nbsp;g/cm for osmium.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Iridium is the most corrosion-resistant metal known: it is not attacked by almost any acid, aqua regia, molten metals or silicates at high temperatures. It can, however, be attacked by some molten salts, such as sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide, as well as oxygen and the halogens (particularly fluorine) at higher temperatures.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n\n<div>See also: Category:Iridium compounds</div>\n<p>Iridium forms compounds in oxidation states between −3 to +6; the most common oxidation states are +3 and +4. Well-characterized examples of the highest oxidation state are rare, but include IrF\n6 and two mixed oxides Sr\n2MgIrO\n6 and Sr\n2CaIrO\n6. In addition, it was reported in 2009 that iridium(VIII) oxide (IrO\n4) was prepared under matrix isolation conditions (6 K in Ar) by UV irradiation of an iridium-peroxo complex. This species, however, is not expected to be stable as a bulk solid at higher temperatures.</p>\n<p>Iridium dioxide, IrO\n2, a brown powder, is the only well-characterized oxide of iridium. A sesquioxide, Ir\n2O\n3, has been described as a blue-black powder which is oxidized to IrO\n2 by HNO\n3. The corresponding disulfides, diselenides, sesquisulfides and sesquiselenides are known and IrS\n3 has also been reported. Iridium also forms iridates with oxidation states +4 and +5, such as K\n2IrO\n3 and KIrO\n3, which can be prepared from the reaction of potassium oxide or potassium superoxide with iridium at high temperatures.</p>\n<p>While no binary hydrides of iridium, Ir\nxH\ny are known, complexes are known that contain IrH4−\n5 and IrH3−\n6, where iridium has the +1 and +3 oxidation states, respectively. The ternary hydride Mg\n6Ir\n2H\n11 is believed to contain both the IrH4−\n5 and the 18-electron IrH5−\n4 anion.</p>\n<p>No monohalides or dihalides are known, whereas trihalides, IrX\n3, are known for all of the halogens. For oxidation states +4 and above, only the tetrafluoride, pentafluoride and hexafluoride are known. Iridium hexafluoride, IrF\n6, is a volatile and highly reactive yellow solid, composed of octahedral molecules. It decomposes in water and is reduced to IrF\n4, a crystalline solid, by iridium black. Iridium pentafluoride has similar properties but it is actually a tetramer, Ir\n4F\n20, formed by four corner-sharing octahedra.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nVaska's complex</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hexachloroiridic(IV) acid, H\n2IrCl\n6, and its ammonium salt are the most important iridium compounds from an industrial perspective. They are involved in the purification of iridium and used as precursors for most other iridium compounds, as well as in the preparation of anode coatings. The IrCl2−\n6 ion has an intense dark brown color, and can be readily reduced to the lighter-colored IrCl3−\n6 and vice versa. Iridium trichloride, IrCl\n3, which can be obtained in anhydrous form from direct oxidation of iridium powder by chlorine at 650&nbsp;°C, or in hydrated form by dissolving Ir\n2O\n3 in hydrochloric acid, is often used as a starting material for the synthesis of other Ir(III) compounds. Another compound used as a starting material is ammonium hexachloroiridate(III), (NH\n4)\n3IrCl\n6. Iridium(III) complexes are diamagnetic (low-spin) and generally have an octahedral molecular geometry.</p>\n<p>Organoiridium compounds contain iridium–carbon bonds where the metal is usually in lower oxidation states. For example, oxidation state zero is found in tetrairidium dodecacarbonyl, Ir\n4(CO)\n12, which is the most common and stable binary carbonyl of iridium. In this compound, each of the iridium atoms is bonded to the other three, forming a tetrahedral cluster. Some organometallic Ir(I) compounds are notable enough to be named after their discoverers. One is Vaska's complex, IrCl(CO)[P(C\n6H\n5)\n3]\n2, which has the unusual property of binding to the dioxygen molecule, O\n2. Another one is Crabtree's catalyst, a homogeneous catalyst for hydrogenation reactions. These compounds are both square planar, d complexes, with a total of 16 valence electrons, which accounts for their reactivity.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of iridium</div>\n<p>Iridium has two naturally occurring, stable isotopes, Ir and Ir, with natural abundances of 37.3% and 62.7%, respectively. At least 34 radioisotopes have also been synthesized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 199. Ir, which falls between the two stable isotopes, is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 73.827&nbsp;days, and finds application in brachytherapy and in industrial radiography, particularly for non-destructive testing of welds in steel in the oil and gas industries; iridium-192 sources have been involved in a number of radiological accidents. Three other isotopes have half-lives of at least a day—Ir, Ir, Ir. Isotopes with masses below 191 decay by some combination of β decay, α decay, and proton emission, with the exceptions of Ir, which decays by electron capture, and Ir, which decays by positron emission. Synthetic isotopes heavier than 191 decay by β decay, although Ir also has a minor electron capture decay path. All known isotopes of iridium were discovered between 1934 and 2001; the most recent is Ir.</p>\n<p>At least 32 metastable isomers have been characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable of these is Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241&nbsp;years, making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is Ir with a half-life of only 2&nbsp;µs. The isotope Ir was the first one of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Greek goddess Iris, after whom iridium was named.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The discovery of iridium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group. Native platinum used by ancient Ethiopians and by South American cultures always contained a small amount of the other platinum group metals, including iridium. Platinum reached Europe as <i>platina</i> (\"small silver\"), found in the 17th century by the Spanish conquerors in a region today known as the department of Chocó in Colombia. The discovery that this metal was not an alloy of known elements, but instead a distinct new element, did not occur until 1748.</p>\n<p>Chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) to create soluble salts. They always observed a small amount of a dark, insoluble residue. Joseph Louis Proust thought that the residue was graphite. The French chemists Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.</p>\n<p>In 1803, British scientist Smithson Tennant (1761–1815) analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal. Vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide, which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named <i>ptene</i>, from the Greek word πτηνός <i>ptēnós</i>, \"winged\". Tennant, who had the advantage of a much greater amount of residue, continued his research and identified the two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue, iridium and osmium. He obtained dark red crystals (probably of Na\n2[IrCl\n6]·<i>n</i>H\n2O) by a sequence of reactions with sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. He named iridium after Iris (Ἶρις), the Greek winged goddess of the rainbow and the messenger of the Olympian gods, because many of the salts he obtained were strongly colored. Discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the Royal Society on June 21, 1804.</p>\n<p>British scientist John George Children was the first to melt a sample of iridium in 1813 with the aid of \"the greatest galvanic battery that has ever been constructed\" (at that time). The first to obtain high purity iridium was Robert Hare in 1842. He found that it had a density of around 21.8&nbsp;g/cm and noted that the metal is nearly unmalleable and very hard. The first melting in appreciable quantity was done by Henri Sainte-Claire Deville and Jules Henri Debray in 1860. They required burning more than 300&nbsp;L of pure O\n2 and H\n2 for each kilogram of iridium.</p>\n<p>These extreme difficulties in melting the metal limited the possibilities for handling iridium. John Isaac Hawkins was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880 John Holland and William Lofland Dudley were able to melt iridium by adding phosphorus and patented the process in the United States; British company Johnson Matthey later stated that they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium at a number of World Fairs. The first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in thermocouples was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<p>In 1957 Rudolf Mössbauer, in what has been called one of the \"landmark experiments in twentieth century physics\", discovered the resonant and recoil-free emission and absorption of gamma rays by atoms in a solid metal sample containing only Ir. This phenomenon, known as the Mössbauer effect (which has since been observed for other nuclei, such as Fe), and developed as Mössbauer spectroscopy, has made important contributions to research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy. Mössbauer received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961, at the age 32, just three years after he published his discovery.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Willamette Meteorite, the sixth-largest meteorite found in the world, has 4.7&nbsp;ppm iridium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Iridium is one of the least abundant elements in the Earth's crust, having an average mass fraction of 0.001&nbsp;ppm in crustal rock; gold is 40 times more abundant, platinum is 10 times more abundant, and silver and mercury are 80 times more abundant. Tellurium is about as abundant as iridium, and only three naturally occurring stable elements are less abundant: rhenium, ruthenium, and rhodium, iridium being 10 times more abundant than the last two. In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock, iridium is relatively common in meteorites, with concentrations of 0.5&nbsp;ppm or more. It is thought that the overall concentration of iridium on Earth is much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks, but because of the density and siderophilic (\"iron-loving\") character of iridium, it descended below the crust and into the Earth's core when the planet was still molten.</p>\n<p>Iridium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys; especially the iridium–osmium alloys, osmiridium (osmium rich), and iridiosmium (iridium rich). In the nickel and copper deposits the platinum group metals occur as sulfides (i.e. (Pt,Pd)S), tellurides (i.e. PtBiTe), antimonides (PdSb), and arsenides (i.e. PtAs\n2). In all of these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium. As with all of the platinum group metals, iridium can be found naturally in alloys with raw nickel or raw copper.</p>\n<p>Within the Earth's crust, iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked from one of the former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld igneous complex in South Africa, though the large copper–nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of iridium. Smaller reserves are found in the United States. Iridium is also found in secondary deposits, combined with platinum and other platinum group metals in alluvial deposits. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department of Colombia are still a source for platinum-group metals. As of 2003 the world reserves had not been estimated.</p>\n<h3>Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary presence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe red arrow points to the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</div>\n<p>The Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary of 65 million years ago, marking the temporal border between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods of geological time, was identified by a thin stratum of iridium-rich clay. A team led by Luis Alvarez proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium, attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact. Their theory, known as the Alvarez hypothesis, is now widely accepted to explain the demise of the dinosaurs. A large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about 65 million years was later identified under what is now the Yucatán Peninsula (the Chicxulub crater). Dewey M. McLean and others argue that the iridium may have been of volcanic origin instead, as the Earth's core is rich in iridium, and active volcanoes such as Piton de la Fournaise, in the island of Réunion, are still releasing iridium.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n\n<p>Iridium is obtained commercially as a by-product from nickel and copper mining and processing. During electrorefining of copper and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals as well as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as <i>anode mud</i>, which forms the starting point for their extraction. To separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid.</p>\n<p>After it is dissolved, iridium is separated from the other platinum group metals by precipitating (NH\n4)\n2IrCl\n6 or by extracting IrCl2−\n6 with organic amines. The first method is similar to the procedure Tennant and Wollaston used for their separation. The second method can be planned as continuous liquid–liquid extraction and is therefore more suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.</p>\n<p>The price of iridium fluctuates considerably, as shown in the table, because of unstable supply, demand, speculation, and hoarding, amplified by the small size of the market and instability in the producing countries. The sharp decrease around 2003 has been related to the oversupply of Ir crucibles used for industrial growth of large single crystals.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>The demand for iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, mostly because of electronics-related applications that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes – iridium crucibles are commonly used for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of Ir in 2007, electrodes for the chloralkali process (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).</p>\n<h3>Industrial and medical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMolecular structure of Ir(mppy)\n3</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The high melting point, hardness and corrosion resistance of iridium and its alloys determine most of its applications. Iridium and especially iridium–platinum alloys or osmium–iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored spinnerets, through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers, such as rayon. Osmium–iridium is used for compass bearings and for balances.</p>\n<p>Corrosion and heat resistance makes iridium an important alloying agent. Certain long-life aircraft engine parts are made of an iridium alloy and an iridium–titanium alloy is used for deep-water pipes because of its corrosion resistance. Iridium is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. The Vickers hardness of pure platinum is 56&nbsp;HV while platinum with 50% of iridium can reach over 500&nbsp;HV.</p>\n<p>Devices that must withstand extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium are used in the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100 °C. Its resistance to arc erosion makes iridium alloys ideal for electrical contacts for spark plugs.</p>\n<p>Iridium compounds are used as catalysts in the Cativa process for carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid.</p>\n<p>The radioisotope iridium-192 is one of the two most important sources of energy for use in industrial γ-radiography for non-destructive testing of metals. Additionally, Ir is used as a source of gamma radiation for the treatment of cancer using brachytherapy, a form of radiotherapy where a sealed radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Specific treatments include high dose rate prostate brachytherapy, bilary duct brachytherapy, and intracavitary cervix brachytherapy.</p>\n<h3>Scientific</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nInternational Prototype Metre bar</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium was used in 1889 to construct the International Prototype Metre and kilogram mass, kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. The meter bar was replaced as the definition of the fundamental unit of length in 1960 by a line in the atomic spectrum of krypton, but the kilogram prototype is still the international standard of mass.</p>\n<p>Iridium has been used in the radioisotope thermoelectric generators of unmanned spacecraft such as the <i>Voyager</i>, <i>Viking</i>, <i>Pioneer</i>, <i>Cassini</i>, <i>Galileo</i>, and <i>New Horizons</i>. Iridium was chosen to encapsulate the plutonium-238 fuel in the generator because it can withstand the operating temperatures of up to 2000&nbsp;°C and for its great strength.</p>\n<p>Another use concerns X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are coated with a layer of iridium 60&nbsp;nm thick. Iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.</p>\n<p>Iridium is used in particle physics for the production of antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a <i>conversion target</i>, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOxidative addition to hydrocarbons in organoiridium chemistry</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Carbon–hydrogen bond activation (C–H activation) is an area of research on reactions that cleave carbon–hydrogen bonds, which were traditionally regarded as unreactive. The first reported successes at activating C–H bonds in saturated hydrocarbons, published in 1982, used organometallic iridium complexes that undergo an oxidative addition with the hydrocarbon.</p>\n<p>Iridium complexes are being investigated as catalysts for asymmetric hydrogenation. These catalysts have been used in the synthesis of natural products and able to hydrogenate certain difficult substrates, such as unfunctionalized alkenes, enantioselectively (generating only one of the two possible enantiomers).</p>\n<p>Iridium forms a variety of complexes of fundamental interest in triplet harvesting.</p>\n<h3>Historical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFountain pen nib labeled <i>Iridium Point</i></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Iridium–osmium alloys were used to tip fountain pen nibs. The first major use of iridium was in 1834 in nibs mounted on gold. Since 1944, the famous Parker 51 fountain pen was fitted with a nib tipped by a ruthenium and iridium alloy (with 3.8% iridium). The tip material in modern fountain pens is still conventionally called \"iridium\", although there is seldom any iridium in it; other metals such as tungsten have taken its place.</p>\n<p>An iridium–platinum alloy was used for the touch holes or vent pieces of cannon. According to a report of the Paris Exhibition of 1867, one of the pieces being exhibited by Johnson and Matthey \"has been used in a Withworth gun for more than 3000 rounds, and scarcely shows signs of wear yet. Those who know the constant trouble and expense which are occasioned by the wearing of the vent-pieces of cannon when in active service, will appreciate this important adaptation\".</p>\n<p>The pigment <i>iridium black</i>, which consists of very finely divided iridium, is used for painting porcelain an intense black; it was said that \"all other porcelain black colors appear grey by the side of it\".</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Iridium in bulk metallic form is not biologically important or hazardous to health due to its lack of reactivity with tissues; there are only about 20&nbsp;parts per trillion of iridium in human tissue. However, finely divided iridium powder can be hazardous to handle, as it is an irritant and may ignite in air. Very little is known about the toxicity of iridium compounds because they are used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself. However, most iridium compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption into the body difficult.</p>\n<p>A radioisotope of iridium, 192Ir, is dangerous like other radioactive isotopes. The only reported injuries related to iridium concern accidental exposure to radiation from 192Ir used in brachytherapy. High-energy gamma radiation from 192Ir can increase the risk of cancer. External exposure can cause burns, radiation poisoning, and death. Ingestion of Ir can burn the linings of the stomach and the intestines. Ir, Ir, and Ir tend to deposit in the liver, and can pose health hazards from both gamma and beta radiation.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Most common oxidation states of iridium are in bold. The right column lists one representative compound for each oxidation state.</li>\n<li>^ Iridium literally means \"of rainbows\".</li>\n<li>^ The definition of the meter was changed again in 1983. The meter is currently defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of ⁄ of a second.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Lide, D.

  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Platinum (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Platinum</b> is a chemical element with the chemical symbol <b>Pt</b> and an atomic number of 78.</p>\n<p>Its name is derived from the Spanish term <i>platina</i>, which is literally translated into \"little silver\". It is a dense, malleable, ductile, precious, gray-white transition metal.</p>\n<p>Platinum has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust and has an average abundance of approximately 5&nbsp;μg/kg. It is the least reactive metal. It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world production.</p>\n<p>As a member of the platinum group of elements, as well as of the group 10 of the periodic table of elements, platinum is generally non-reactive. It exhibits a remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, and as such is considered a noble metal. As a result, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers, it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early as 16th century, but it was not until Antonio de Ulloa published a report on a new metal of Colombian origin in 1748 that it became investigated by scientists.</p>\n<p>Platinum is used in catalytic converters, laboratory equipment, electrical contacts and electrodes, platinum resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. Because only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, it is a scarce material, and is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity. Being a heavy metal, it leads to health issues upon exposure to its salts, but due to its corrosion resistance, it is not as toxic as some metals. Compounds containing platinum, most notably cisplatin, are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<p>As a pure metal, platinum is silver-white in color, lustrous, ductile, and malleable. Platinum is more ductile than gold, silver and copper, thus being the most ductile of pure metals, but gold is still more malleable than platinum. It does not oxidize at any temperature, although it is corroded by halogens, cyanides, sulfur, and caustic alkalis. Platinum is insoluble in hydrochloric and nitric acid, but dissolves in hot <i>aqua regia</i> to form chloroplatinic acid, HPtCl.</p>\n<p>Platinum's resistance to wear and tarnish is well suited for making fine jewelry. Pure platinum is slightly harder than pure iron. The metal has an excellent resistance to corrosion and high temperature and has stable electrical properties. All of these characteristics have been used for industrial applications.</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<div>See also: Platinum group</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPlatinum dissolves in hot <i>aqua regia</i></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The most common oxidation states of platinum are +2 and +4. The +1 and +3 oxidation states are less common, and are often stabilized by metal bonding in bimetallic (or polymetallic) species. As is expected, tetracoordinate platinum(II) compounds tend to adopt 16-electron square planar geometries. While elemental platinum is generally unreactive, it dissolves in hot <i>aqua regia</i> to give aqueous chloroplatinic acid (HPtCl):</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Pt + 4 HNO + 6 HCl → HPtCl + 4 NO + 4 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>As a soft acid, platinum has a great affinity for sulfur, such as on dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); numerous DMSO complexes have been reported and care should be taken in the choice of reaction solvent.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of platinum</div>\n<p>Platinum has six naturally occurring isotopes: Pt, Pt, Pt, Pt, Pt, and Pt. The most abundant of these is Pt, comprising 33.83% of all platinum. It is the only stable isotope with a non-zero spin; with a spin of /, Pt satellite peaks are often observed in H and P NMR spectroscopy (i.e., Pt-phosphine and Pt-alkyl complexes). Pt is the least abundant at only 0.01%. Of the naturally occurring isotopes, only Pt is unstable, though it decays with a half-life of 6.5×10&nbsp;years. Pt can undergo alpha decay, but its decay had never been observed (the half-life is known to be longer than 3.2×10&nbsp;years), therefore it is considered stable. Platinum also has 31 synthetic isotopes ranging in atomic mass from 166 to 202, making the total number of known isotopes 37. The least stable of these is Pt with a half-life of 300&nbsp;µs, while the most stable is Pt with a half-life of 50&nbsp;years. Most platinum isotopes decay by some combination of beta decay and alpha decay. Pt, Pt, and Pt decay primarily by electron capture. Pt and Pt have double beta decay paths.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA native platinum nugget, Kondyor mine, Khabarovsk Krai</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPlatinum output in 2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Platinum is an extremely rare metal, occurring at a concentration of only 0.005 ppm in the Earth's crust. It is sometimes mistaken for silver (Ag). Platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and alloyed with iridium as platiniridium. Most often the native platinum is found in secondary deposits; platinum is combined with the other platinum group metals in alluvial deposits. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum group metals. Another large alluvial deposit is in the Ural Mountains, Russia, and it is still mined.</p>\n<p>In nickel and copper deposits, platinum group metals occur as sulfides (e.g. (Pt,Pd)S), tellurides (e.g. PtBiTe), antimonides (PdSb), and arsenides (e.g. PtAs), and as end alloys with nickel or copper. Platinum arsenide, sperrylite (PtAs), is a major source of platinum associated with nickel ores in the Sudbury Basin deposit in Ontario, Canada. At Platinum, Alaska, about 17,000&nbsp;kg (550,000&nbsp;ozt) had been mined between 1927 and 1975. The mine ceased operations in 1990. The rare sulfide mineral cooperite, (Pt,Pd,Ni)S, contains platinum along with palladium and nickel. Cooperite occurs in the Merensky Reef within the Bushveld complex, Gauteng, South Africa.</p>\n<p>In 1865, chromites were identified in the Bushveld region of South Africa, followed by the discovery of platinum in 1906. The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld complex in South Africa. The large copper–nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin, Canada, are the two other large deposits. In the Sudbury Basin, the huge quantities of nickel ore processed make up for the fact platinum is present as only 0.5 ppm in the ore. Smaller reserves can be found in the United States, for example in the Absaroka Range in Montana. In 2010, South Africa was the top producer of platinum, with an almost 77% share, followed by Russia at 13%; world production in 2010 was 192,000&nbsp;kg.</p>\n<p>Platinum deposits are present in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. and a MOU has been signed between Geological Survey of India with TAMIN – Tamil Nadu Minerals Ltd.</p>\n<p>Platinum exists in higher abundances on the Moon and in meteorites. Correspondingly, platinum is found in slightly higher abundances at sites of bolide impact on the Earth that are associated with resulting post-impact volcanism, and can be mined economically; the Sudbury Basin is one such example.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<p>Hexachloroplatinic acid mentioned above is probably the most important platinum compound, as it serves as the precursor for many other platinum compounds. By itself, it has various applications in photography, zinc etchings, indelible ink, plating, mirrors, porcelain coloring, and as a catalyst.</p>\n<p>Treatment of hexachloroplatinic acid with an ammonium salt, such as ammonium chloride, gives ammonium hexachloroplatinate, which is relatively insoluble in ammonium solutions. Heating this ammonium salt in the presence of hydrogen reduces it to elemental platinum. Potassium hexachloroplatinate is similarly insoluble, and hexachloroplatinic acid has been used in the determination of potassium ions by gravimetry.</p>\n<p>When hexachloroplatinic acid is heated, it decomposes through platinum(IV) chloride and platinum(II) chloride to elemental platinum, although the reactions do not occur stepwise:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>(HO)PtCl·<i>n</i>HO  PtCl + 2 HCl + (<i>n</i> + 2) HO</dd>\n<dd>PtCl  PtCl + Cl</dd>\n<dd>PtCl  Pt + Cl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>All three reactions are reversible. Platinum(II) and platinum(IV) bromides are known as well. Platinum hexafluoride is a strong oxidizer capable of oxidizing oxygen.</p>\n<h3>Oxides</h3>\n<p>Platinum(IV) oxide, PtO, also known as Adams' catalyst, is a black powder which is soluble in KOH solutions and concentrated acids. PtO and the less common PtO both decompose upon heating. Platinum(II,IV) oxide, PtO, is formed in the following reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Pt + Pt + 4 O → PtO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Platinum also forms a trioxide, where it is present in the +4 oxidation state.</p>\n<h3>Other compounds</h3>\n<p>Unlike palladium acetate, platinum(II) acetate is not commercially available. Where a base is desired, the halides have been used in conjunction with sodium acetate. The use of platinum(II) acetylacetonate has also been reported.</p>\n<p>Several barium platinides have been synthesized in which platinum exhibits negative oxidation states ranging from −1 to −2. These include BaPt, Ba\n3Pt\n2, and Ba\n2Pt. Caesium platinide, Cs\n2Pt, a dark-red transparent crystalline compound has been shown to contain Pt2− anions. Platinum also exhibits negative oxidation states at surfaces reduced electrochemically. The negative oxidation states exhibited by platinum are unusual for metallic elements, and they are attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals.</p>\n<p>Zeise's salt, containing an ethylene ligand, was one of the first organometallic compounds discovered. Dichloro(cycloocta-1,5-diene)platinum(II) is a commercially available olefin complex, which contains easily displaceable cod ligands (\"cod\" being an abbreviation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene). The cod complex and the halides are convenient starting points to platinum chemistry.</p>\n<p>Cisplatin, or <i>cis</i>-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) is the first of a series of square planar platinum(II)-containing chemotherapy drugs, including carboplatin and oxaliplatin. These compounds are capable of crosslinking DNA, and kill cells by similar pathways to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The hexachloroplatinate ion</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The anion of Zeise's salt</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Dichloro(cycloocta-1,5-diene)platinum(II)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Cisplatin</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The metal was used by pre-Columbian Americans near modern-day Esmeraldas, Ecuador to produce artifacts of a white gold-platinum alloy. The first European reference to platinum appears in 1557 in the writings of the Italian humanist Julius Caesar Scaliger as a description of an unknown noble metal found between Darién and Mexico, \"which no fire nor any Spanish artifice has yet been able to liquefy.\"</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThis alchemical symbol for platinum was made by joining the symbols of silver and gold.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAntonio de Ulloa is credited with the discovery of platinum.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 1741, Charles Wood, a British metallurgist, found various samples of Colombian platinum in Jamaica, which he sent to William Brownrigg for further investigation. Antonio de Ulloa, also credited with the discovery of platinum, returned to Spain from the French Geodesic Mission in 1746 after having been there for eight years. His historical account of the expedition included a description of platinum as being neither separable nor calcinable. Ulloa also anticipated the discovery of platinum mines. After publishing the report in 1748, Ulloa did not continue to investigate the new metal. In 1758, he was sent to superintend mercury mining operations in Huancavelica.</p>\n<p>In 1750, after studying the platinum sent to him by Wood, Brownrigg presented a detailed account of the metal to the Royal Society, mentioning that he had seen no mention of it in any previous accounts of known minerals. Brownrigg also made note of platinum's extremely high melting point and refractoriness toward borax. Other chemists across Europe soon began studying platinum, including Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, Torbern Bergman, Jöns Jakob Berzelius, William Lewis, and Pierre Macquer. In 1752, Henrik Scheffer published a detailed scientific description of the metal, which he referred to as \"white gold\", including an account of how he succeeded in fusing platinum ore with the aid of arsenic. Scheffer described platinum as being less pliable than gold, but with similar resistance to corrosion.</p>\n<p>Carl von Sickingen researched platinum extensively in 1772. He succeeded in making malleable platinum by alloying it with gold, dissolving the alloy in hot <i>aqua regia</i>, precipitating the platinum with ammonium chloride, igniting the ammonium chloroplatinate, and hammering the resulting finely divided platinum to make it cohere. Franz Karl Achard made the first platinum crucible in 1784. He worked with the platinum by fusing it with arsenic, then later volatilizing the arsenic.</p>\n<p>Since the other platinum family members were not discovered yet (platinum was the first in the list), Scheffer and Sickingen made the false assumption that due to its hardness – which is slightly more than for pure iron – platinum would be a relatively non pliable material, even brittle at times, when in fact its ductility and malleability are close to that of gold. Their assumptions could not be avoided since the platinum they experimented with was highly contaminated with minute amounts of the platinum family elements such as Osmium and Iridium amongst others, which embrittled the platinum alloy. Alloying this impure platinum residue called \"plyoxen\" with gold was the only solution at the time to obtain a pliable compound, but nowadays, very pure platinum is available and extremely long wire can be drawn from pure platinum, very easily, due to its crystalline structure which is similar to that of many soft metals.</p>\n<p>In 1786, Charles III of Spain provided a library and laboratory to Pierre-François Chabaneau to aid in his research of platinum. Chabaneau succeeded in removing various impurities from the ore, including gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron. This led him to believe he was working with a single metal, but in truth the ore still contained the yet-undiscovered platinum group metals. This led to inconsistent results in his experiments. At times, the platinum seemed malleable, but when it was alloyed with iridium, it would be much more brittle. Sometimes the metal was entirely incombustible, but when alloyed with osmium, it would volatilize. After several months, Chabaneau succeeded in producing 23&nbsp;kilograms of pure, malleable platinum by hammering and compressing the sponge form while white-hot. Chabeneau realized the infusibility of platinum would lend value to objects made of it, and so started a business with Joaquín Cabezas producing platinum ingots and utensils. This started what is known as the \"platinum age\" in Spain.</p>\n<p>In 2007, Gerhard Ertl won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for determining the detailed molecular mechanisms of the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide over platinum (catalytic converter).</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n1,000 cubic centimeters of 99.9% pure platinum, worth about US$970,600 at 14 July 2012 prices</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Platinum, along with the rest of the platinum metals, is obtained commercially as a by-product from nickel and copper mining and processing. During electrorefining of copper, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals as well as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as \"anode mud\", which forms the starting point for the extraction of the platinum group metals.</p>\n<p>If pure platinum is found in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is also nonmagnetic, while nickel and iron are both magnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, while other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in either of the two acids and recovering the remaining platinum.</p>\n<p>One suitable method for purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, and the other platinum group metals, is to process it with <i>aqua regia</i>, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, while osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated by the addition of iron(III) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to the metal by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCutaway view of a metal-core catalytic converter</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Of the 245&nbsp;tonnes of platinum sold in 2010, 113&nbsp;tonnes were used for vehicle emissions control devices (46%), 76&nbsp;tonnes for jewelry (31%). The remaining 35.5&nbsp;tonnes went to various other minor applications, such as investment, electrodes, anticancer drugs, oxygen sensors, spark plugs and turbine engines.</p>\n<h3>Catalysis</h3>\n<p>The most common use of platinum is as a catalyst in chemical reactions, many times as platinum black. It has been employed in this application since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst in a number of separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline which becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum metal also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen gas.</p>\n<h3>Standard</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPrototype International Meter bar</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>From 1889 to 1960, the meter was defined as the length of a platinum-iridium (90:10) alloy bar, known as the International Prototype Meter bar. The previous bar was made of platinum in 1799. The International Prototype Kilogram remains defined by a cylinder of the same platinum-iridium alloy made in 1879.</p>\n<p>The standard hydrogen electrode also uses a platinized platinum electrode due to its corrosion resistance, and other attributes.</p>\n<h3>Precious metal</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPlatinum Eagle</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main articles: Platinum as an investment and Platinum coin</div>\n<p>Platinum is a precious metal commodity; its bullion has the ISO currency code of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewelry, usually as a 90–95% alloy, due to its inertness and shine. Jewelry trade publications advise jewelers to present minute surface scratches (which they term patina) as a desirable feature.</p>\n<p>In watchmaking, Vacheron Constantin, Patek Philippe, Rolex, Breitling, and other companies use platinum for producing their limited edition watch series. Watchmakers appreciate the unique properties of platinum, as it neither tarnishes nor wears out (relative to gold).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAverage price of platinum from 1992 to 2012 in US$ per troy ounce (~$20/g)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The price of platinum, like other industrial commodities, is more volatile than that of gold. In 2008, the price of platinum dropped from $2,252 to $774 per oz, a loss of nearly 2/3 of its value. By contrast, the price of gold dropped from ~$1,000 to ~$700/oz during the same time frame, a loss of only 1/3 of its value.</p>\n<p>During periods of sustained economic stability and growth, the price of platinum tends to be as much as twice the price of gold, whereas during periods of economic uncertainty, the price of platinum tends to decrease due to reduced industrial demand, falling below the price of gold. Gold prices are more stable in slow economic times, as gold is considered a safe haven and gold demand is not driven by industrial uses. In the 18th century, platinum's rarity made King Louis XV of France declare it the only metal fit for a king.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>In the laboratory, platinum wire is used for electrodes; platinum pans and supports are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000&nbsp;°C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent magnets. Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.</p>\n<h3>Symbol of prestige</h3>\n<div>See also: Platinum album&nbsp;and Platinum (color)</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAn assortment of native platinum nuggets</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Platinum's rarity as a metal has caused advertisers to associate it with exclusivity and wealth. \"Platinum\" debit and credit cards have greater privileges than \"gold\" cards. \"Platinum awards\" are the second highest possible, ranking above \"gold\", \"silver\" and \"bronze\", but below diamond. For example, in the United States, a musical album that has sold more than 1&nbsp;million copies, will be credited as \"platinum\", whereas an album that sold more than 10&nbsp;million copies will be certified as \"diamond\". Some products, such as blenders and vehicles, with a silvery-white color are identified as \"platinum\". Platinum is considered a precious metal, although its use is not as common as the use of gold or silver. The frame of the Crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, manufactured for her coronation as Consort of King George VI, is made of platinum. It was the first British crown to be made of this particular metal.</p>\n<h2>Health issues</h2>\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, short-term exposure to platinum salts may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and long-term exposure may cause both respiratory and skin allergies. The current OSHA standard is 2&nbsp;micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an 8-hour work shift.</p>\n<p>Platinum-based antineoplastic agents are used in chemotherapy, and show good activity against some tumors.</p>\n<p>As platinum is a catalyst in the manufacture of the silicone rubber and gel components of several types of medical implants (breast implants, joint replacement prosthetics, artificial lumbar discs, vascular access ports, etc.), the possibility platinum could enter the body and cause adverse effects has merited study. The Food and Drug Administration and other institutions have reviewed the issue and found no evidence to suggest toxicity in vivo.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mixed metal oxide electrode</li>\n<li>Platinum in Africa</li>\n<li>Platinum nanoparticles</li>\n<li>2000s commodities boom</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ \"platinum (Pt).\" Encyclopædia Britannica Online.

  "title": "Gold",
  "html": "<div>\"Element 79\" redirects here. For the short story and anthology by Fred Hoyle, see Element 79 (anthology).</div>\n<div>This article is about the metal.  For the color, see Gold (color).  For other uses, see Gold (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Gold</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Au</b> and atomic number 79. It is a dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal with a bright yellow color and luster that is considered attractive, which is maintained without tarnishing in air or water. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, solid under standard conditions. The metal therefore occurs often in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains in rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, usually with tellurium.</p>\n<p>Gold resists attacks by individual acids, but it can be dissolved by the aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid), so named because it dissolves gold. Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which have been used in mining. It dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys; is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property that has long been used to confirm the presence of gold in items, giving rise to the term <i>acid test.</i></p>\n<p>This metal has been a valuable and highly sought-after precious metal for coinage, jewelry, and other arts since long before the beginning of recorded history. Gold standards have sometimes been monetary policies, but were widely supplanted by fiat currency starting in the 1930s. The last gold certificate and gold coin currencies were issued in the U.S. in 1932. In Europe, most countries left the gold standard with the start of World War I in 1914 and, with huge war debts, did not return to gold as a medium of exchange.</p>\n<p>A total of 171,300 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history, according to GFMS as of 2011. This is roughly equivalent to 5.5 billion troy ounces or, in terms of volume, about 8876 m, or a cube 20.7 m on a side. The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry.</p>\n<p>Besides its widespread monetary and symbolic functions, gold has many practical uses in dentistry, electronics, and other fields. Its high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity has led to many uses, including electric wiring, colored-glass production, and gold leafing.</p>\n<p>Most of the Earth's gold lies at its core, the metal's high density having made it sink there in the planet's youth. Virtually all discovered gold is considered to have been deposited later by meteorites that contained the element, with the asteroid that formed Vredefort crater having been implicated in the formation of the largest gold mining region on earth, Witwatersrand basin.</p>\n\n<h2>Etymology</h2>\n<p>\"Gold\" is cognate with similar words in many Germanic languages, deriving via Proto-Germanic *<i>gulþą</i> from Proto-Indo-European *<i>gʰel-</i> (\"yellow/green\").</p>\n<p>The symbol <b>Au</b> is from the Latin: aurum, according to some sources meaning \"shining dawn\", from Sabine <i>ausum</i> \"glowing dawn\" although according to definitions within Latin dictionaries the meaning of the word <i>aurum</i> extends only to the same as today's reference to the metal. The disagreement between definitions is possibly due to the accumulation of evidence from archaeology of the original anciency of the metal in civilization; in reference to \"the dawn of civilization\", and in this respect has become the adopted modern meaning, disassociated from the original etymological Latin.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Gold is the most malleable of all metals; a single gram can be beaten into a sheet of 1 square meter, or an ounce into 300 square feet. Gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become transparent. The transmitted light appears greenish blue, because gold strongly reflects yellow and red. Such semi-transparent sheets also strongly reflect infrared light, making them useful as infrared (radiant heat) shields in visors of heat-resistant suits, and in sun-visors for spacesuits.</p>\n<p>Gold readily creates alloys with many other metals. These alloys can be produced to modify the hardness and other metallurgical properties, to control melting point or to create exotic colors. Gold is a good conductor of heat and electricity and reflects infrared radiation strongly. Chemically, it is unaffected by air, moisture and most corrosive reagents, and is therefore well suited for use in coins and jewelry and as a protective coating on other, more reactive metals. However, it is not chemically inert. Gold is almost insoluble, but can be dissolved in aqua regia.</p>\n<p>Common oxidation states of gold include +1 (gold(I) or aurous compounds) and +3 (gold(III) or auric compounds). Gold ions in solution are readily reduced and precipitated as metal by adding any other metal as the reducing agent. The added metal is oxidized and dissolves, allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate.</p>\n<p>In addition, gold is very dense, a cubic meter weighing 19,300 kg. By comparison, the density of lead is 11,340&nbsp;kg/m, and that of the densest element, osmium, is 22,610&nbsp;kg/m.</p>\n<h3>Color</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDifferent colors of Ag-Au-Cu alloys</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Whereas most other pure metals are gray or silvery white, gold is yellow. This color is determined by the density of loosely bound (valence) electrons; those electrons oscillate as a collective \"plasma\" medium described in terms of a quasiparticle called plasmon. The frequency of these oscillations lies in the ultraviolet range for most metals, but it falls into the visible range for gold due to subtle relativistic effects that affect the orbitals around gold atoms. Similar effects impart a golden hue to metallic caesium.</p>\n<p>Common colored gold alloys such as rose gold can be created by the addition of various amounts of copper and silver, as indicated in the triangular diagram to the left. Alloys containing palladium or nickel are also important in commercial jewelry as these produce white gold alloys. Less commonly, addition of manganese, aluminium, iron, indium and other elements can produce more unusual colors of gold for various applications.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of gold</div>\n<p>Gold has only one stable isotope, Au, which is also its only naturally occurring isotope. Thirty-six radioisotopes have been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from 169 to 205. The most stable of these is Au with a half-life of 186.1 days. The least stable is Au, which decays by proton emission with a half-life of 30 µs. Most of gold's radioisotopes with atomic masses below 197 decay by some combination of proton emission, α decay, and β+ decay. The exceptions are Au, which decays by electron capture, and Au, which decays most often by electron capture (93%) with a minor β- decay path (7%). All of gold's radioisotopes with atomic masses above 197 decay by β- decay.</p>\n<p>At least 32 nuclear isomers have also been characterized, ranging in atomic mass from 170 to 200. Within that range, only Au, Au, Au, Au, and Au do not have isomers. Gold's most stable isomer is Au with a half-life of 2.27 days. Gold's least stable isomer is Au with a half-life of only 7 ns. Au has three decay paths: β+ decay, isomeric transition, and alpha decay. No other isomer or isotope of gold has three decay paths.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Monetary exchange</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGold is commonly formed into bars for use in monetary exchange.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Gold has been widely used throughout the world as a vehicle for monetary exchange, either by issuance and recognition of gold coins or other bare metal quantities, or through gold-convertible paper instruments by establishing gold standards in which the total value of issued money is represented in a store of gold reserves.</p>\n<p>The first gold coins of the Grecian age were struck in Lydia around 700 BC. The <i>talent</i> coin of gold in use during the periods of Grecian history both before and during the time of the life of Homer weighed between 8.42 and 8.75&nbsp;grams. From an earlier preference in using silver, European economies re-established the minting of gold as coinage during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</p>\n<p>However, production has not grown in relation to the world's economies. Today, gold mining output is declining. With the sharp growth of economies in the 20th century, and increasing foreign exchange, the world's gold reserves and their trading market have become a small fraction of all markets and fixed exchange rates of currencies to gold were no longer sustained.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of World War I the warring nations moved to a fractional gold standard, inflating their currencies to finance the war effort. After World War II gold was replaced by a system of convertible currency following the Bretton Woods system. Gold standards and the direct convertibility of currencies to gold have been abandoned by world governments, being replaced by fiat currency in their stead. Switzerland was the last country to tie its currency to gold; it backed 40% of its value until the Swiss joined the International Monetary Fund in 1999.</p>\n<p>The gold content of alloys is measured in carats (k). Pure gold is designated as 24k. English gold coins intended for circulation from 1526 into the 1930s were typically a standard 22k alloy called crown gold, for hardness (American gold coins for circulation after 1837 contained the slightly lower amount of 0.900 fine gold, or 21.6 kt).</p>\n<p>Although the prices of some platinum group metals can be much higher, gold has long been considered the most desirable of precious metals, and its value has been used as the standard for many currencies. Gold has been used as a symbol for purity, value, royalty, and particularly roles that combine these properties. Gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was ridiculed by Thomas More in his treatise <i>Utopia</i>. On that imaginary island, gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves, tableware, and lavatory seats. When ambassadors from other countries arrive, dressed in ostentatious gold jewels and badges, the Utopians mistake them for menial servants, paying homage instead to the most modestly dressed of their party.</p>\n<h3>Investment</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGold prices (US$ per troy ounce), in nominal US$ and inflation adjusted US$.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Gold as an investment</div>\n<p>Many holders of gold store it in form of bullion coins or bars as a hedge against inflation or other economic disruptions. However, economist Martin Feldstein does not believe gold serves as a hedge against inflation or currency depreciation.</p>\n<p>The ISO 4217 currency code of gold is XAU.</p>\n<p>Modern bullion coins for investment or collector purposes do not require good mechanical wear properties; they are typically fine gold at 24k, although the American Gold Eagle and the British gold sovereign continue to be minted in 22k metal in historical tradition, and the South African Krugerand, first released in 1967, is also 22k. The <i>special issue</i> Canadian Gold Maple Leaf coin contains the highest purity gold of any bullion coin, at 99.999% or 0.99999, while the <i>popular issue</i> Canadian Gold Maple Leaf coin has a purity of 99.99%.</p>\n<p>Several other 99.99% pure gold coins are available. In 2006, the United States Mint began producing the American Buffalo gold bullion coin with a purity of 99.99%. The Australian Gold Kangaroos were first coined in 1986 as the Australian Gold Nugget but changed the reverse design in 1989. Other modern coins include the Austrian Vienna Philharmonic bullion coin and the Chinese Gold Panda.</p>\n<h3>Jewelry</h3>\n<div>Main article: Jewelry</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMoche gold necklace depicting feline heads. Larco Museum Collection. Lima-Peru</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Because of the softness of pure (24k) gold, it is usually alloyed with base metals for use in jewelry, altering its hardness and ductility, melting point, color and other properties. Alloys with lower caratage, typically 22k, 18k, 14k or 10k, contain higher percentages of copper or other base metals or silver or palladium in the alloy. Copper is the most commonly used base metal, yielding a redder color.</p>\n<p>Eighteen-carat gold containing 25% copper is found in antique and Russian jewelry and has a distinct, though not dominant, copper cast, creating rose gold. Fourteen-carat gold-copper alloy is nearly identical in color to certain bronze alloys, and both may be used to produce police and other badges. Blue gold can be made by alloying with iron and purple gold can be made by alloying with aluminium, although rarely done except in specialized jewelry. Blue gold is more brittle and therefore more difficult to work with when making jewelry.</p>\n<p>Fourteen- and eighteen-carat gold alloys with silver alone appear greenish-yellow and are referred to as green gold. White gold alloys can be made with palladium or nickel. White 18-carat gold containing 17.3% nickel, 5.5% zinc and 2.2% copper is silvery in appearance. Nickel is toxic, however, and its release from nickel white gold is controlled by legislation in Europe.</p>\n<p>Alternative white gold alloys are available based on palladium, silver and other white metals, but the palladium alloys are more expensive than those using nickel. High-carat white gold alloys are far more resistant to corrosion than are either pure silver or sterling silver. The Japanese craft of Mokume-gane exploits the color contrasts between laminated colored gold alloys to produce decorative wood-grain effects.</p>\n<h3>Medicine</h3>\n<p>Conceived of as perhaps the most anciently administered medicine (apparently according to one source by shamanic practitioners) and known of by Dioscorides, apparent paradoxes of the actual toxicology of the substance nevertheless suggests the possibility still of serious gaps in understanding of action on physiology.</p>\n<p>In medieval times, gold was often seen as beneficial for the health, in the belief that something so rare and beautiful could not be anything but healthy. Even some modern esotericists and forms of alternative medicine assign metallic gold a healing power. Some gold salts do have anti-inflammatory properties and are used as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of arthritis and other similar conditions. Gold based injections have been explored as a means to help to reduce the pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculosis. However, only salts and radioisotopes of gold are of pharmacological value, as elemental (metallic) gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the body.</p>\n<p>Gold alloys are used in restorative dentistry, especially in tooth restorations, such as crowns and permanent bridges. The gold alloys' slight malleability facilitates the creation of a superior molar mating surface with other teeth and produces results that are generally more satisfactory than those produced by the creation of porcelain crowns. The use of gold crowns in more prominent teeth such as incisors is favored in some cultures and discouraged in others.</p>\n<p>Colloidal gold preparations (suspensions of gold nanoparticles) in water are intensely red-colored, and can be made with tightly controlled particle sizes up to a few tens of nanometers across by reduction of gold chloride with citrate or ascorbate ions. Colloidal gold is used in research applications in medicine, biology and materials science. The technique of immunogold labeling exploits the ability of the gold particles to adsorb protein molecules onto their surfaces. Colloidal gold particles coated with specific antibodies can be used as probes for the presence and position of antigens on the surfaces of cells. In ultrathin sections of tissues viewed by electron microscopy, the immunogold labels appear as extremely dense round spots at the position of the antigen.</p>\n<p>Gold, or alloys of gold and palladium, are applied as conductive coating to biological specimens and other non-conducting materials such as plastics and glass to be viewed in a scanning electron microscope. The coating, which is usually applied by sputtering with an argon plasma, has a triple role in this application. Gold's very high electrical conductivity drains electrical charge to earth, and its very high density provides stopping power for electrons in the electron beam, helping to limit the depth to which the electron beam penetrates the specimen. This improves definition of the position and topography of the specimen surface and increases the spatial resolution of the image. Gold also produces a high output of secondary electrons when irradiated by an electron beam, and these low-energy electrons are the most commonly used signal source used in the scanning electron microscope.</p>\n<p>The isotope gold-198 (half-life 2.7 days) is used, in nuclear medicine, in some cancer treatments and for treating other diseases.</p>\n<h3>Food and drink</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gold can be used in food and has the E number 175.</li>\n<li>Gold leaf, flake or dust is used on and in some gourmet foods, notably sweets and drinks as decorative ingredient. Gold flake was used by the nobility in medieval Europe as a decoration in food and drinks, in the form of leaf, flakes or dust, either to demonstrate the host's wealth or in the belief that something that valuable and rare must be beneficial for one's health.</li>\n<li>Danziger Goldwasser (German: Gold water of Danzig) or Goldwasser (English: Goldwater) is a traditional German herbal liqueur produced in what is today Gdańsk, Poland, and Schwabach, Germany, and contains flakes of gold leaf. There are also some expensive (~$1000) cocktails which contain flakes of gold leaf. However, since metallic gold is inert to all body chemistry, it has no taste, it provides no nutrition, and it leaves the body unaltered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Industry</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe 220kg gold brick displayed in Jinguashi Gold Museum, Taiwan, Republic of China.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe world's largest gold bar has a mass of 250 kg. Toi museum, Japan.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA gold nugget of 5 mm in diameter (bottom) can be expanded through hammering into a gold foil of about 0.5 square meters. Toi museum, Japan.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Gold solder is used for joining the components of gold jewelry by high-temperature hard soldering or brazing. If the work is to be of hallmarking quality, gold solder must match the carat weight of the work, and alloy formulas are manufactured in most industry-standard carat weights to color match yellow and white gold. Gold solder is usually made in at least three melting-point ranges referred to as Easy, Medium and Hard. By using the hard, high-melting point solder first, followed by solders with progressively lower melting points, goldsmiths can assemble complex items with several separate soldered joints.</li>\n<li>Gold can be made into thread and used in embroidery.</li>\n<li>Gold produces a deep, intense red color when used as a coloring agent in cranberry glass.</li>\n<li>In photography, gold toners are used to shift the color of silver bromide black-and-white prints towards brown or blue tones, or to increase their stability. Used on sepia-toned prints, gold toners produce red tones. Kodak published formulas for several types of gold toners, which use gold as the chloride.</li>\n<li>Gold is a good reflector of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared and visible light as well as radio waves. It is used for the protective coatings on many artificial satellites, in infrared protective faceplates in thermal protection suits and astronauts' helmets and in electronic warfare planes like the EA-6B Prowler.</li>\n<li>Gold is used as the reflective layer on some high-end CDs.</li>\n<li>Automobiles may use gold for heat shielding. McLaren uses gold foil in the engine compartment of its F1 model.</li>\n<li>Gold can be manufactured so thin that it appears transparent. It is used in some aircraft cockpit windows for de-icing or anti-icing by passing electricity through it. The heat produced by the resistance of the gold is enough to deter ice from forming.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Electronics</h3>\n<p>The concentration of free electrons in gold metal is 5.90×10 cm. Gold is highly conductive to electricity, and has been used for electrical wiring in some high-energy applications (only silver and copper are more conductive per volume, but gold has the advantage of corrosion resistance). For example, gold electrical wires were used during some of the Manhattan Project's atomic experiments, but large high current silver wires were used in the calutron isotope separator magnets in the project.</p>\n<p>Though gold is attacked by free chlorine, its good conductivity and general resistance to oxidation and corrosion in other environments (including resistance to non-chlorinated acids) has led to its widespread industrial use in the electronic era as a thin layer coating electrical connectors, thereby ensuring good connection. For example, gold is used in the connectors of the more expensive electronics cables, such as audio, video and USB cables. The benefit of using gold over other connector metals such as tin in these applications has been debated; gold connectors are often criticized by audio-visual experts as unnecessary for most consumers and seen as simply a marketing ploy. However, the use of gold in other applications in electronic sliding contacts in highly humid or corrosive atmospheres, and in use for contacts with a very high failure cost (certain computers, communications equipment, spacecraft, jet aircraft engines) remains very common.</p>\n<p>Besides sliding electrical contacts, gold is also used in electrical contacts because of its resistance to corrosion, electrical conductivity, ductility and lack of toxicity. Switch contacts are generally subjected to more intense corrosion stress than are sliding contacts. Fine gold wires are used to connect semiconductor devices to their packages through a process known as wire bonding.</p>\n<h3>Commercial chemistry</h3>\n<p>Gold is attacked by and dissolves in alkaline solutions of potassium or sodium cyanide, to form the salt gold cyanide—a technique that has been used in extracting metallic gold from ores in the cyanide process. Gold cyanide is the electrolyte used in commercial electroplating of gold onto base metals and electroforming.</p>\n<p>Gold chloride (chloroauric acid) solutions are used to make colloidal gold by reduction with citrate or ascorbate ions. Gold chloride and gold oxide are used to make cranberry or red-colored glass, which, like colloidal gold suspensions, contains evenly sized spherical gold nanoparticles.</p>\n<h2>Cultural history</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Turin Papyrus Map</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFunerary mask of Tutankhamun</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nJason returns with the golden fleece on an Apulian red-figure calyx krater, ca. 340–330 BC.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAncient Greek golden decorated crown, funerary or marriage material, 370–360 BC.

Gold artifacts in the Balkans also appear from the 4th millennium BC, such as those found in the Varna Necropolis near Lake Varna in Bulgaria, thought by one source (La Niece 2009) to be the earliest \"well-dated\" find of gold artifacts. Gold artifacts such as the golden hats and the Nebra disk appeared in Central Europe from the 2nd millennium BC Bronze Age.</p>\n<p>Egyptian hieroglyphs from as early as 2600 BC describe gold, which king Tushratta of the Mitanni claimed was \"more plentiful than dirt\" in Egypt. Egypt and especially Nubia had the resources to make them major gold-producing areas for much of history. The earliest known map is known as the Turin Papyrus Map and shows the plan of a gold mine in Nubia together with indications of the local geology. The primitive working methods are described by both Strabo and Diodorus Siculus, and included fire-setting. Large mines were also present across the Red Sea in what is now Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>The legend of the golden fleece may refer to the use of fleeces to trap gold dust from placer deposits in the ancient world. Gold is mentioned frequently in the Old Testament, starting with Genesis 2:11 (at Havilah), the story of The Golden Calf and many parts of the temple including the Menorah and the golden altar. In the New Testament, it is included with the gifts of the magi in the first chapters of Matthew. The Book of Revelation 21:21 describes the city of New Jerusalem as having streets \"made of pure gold, clear as crystal\". Exploitation of gold in the south-east corner of the Black Sea is said to date from the time of Midas, and this gold was important in the establishment of what is probably the world's earliest coinage in Lydia around 610 BC. From the 6th or 5th century BC, the Chu (state) circulated the Ying Yuan, one kind of square gold coin.</p>\n<p>In Roman metallurgy, new methods for extracting gold on a large scale were developed by introducing hydraulic mining methods, especially in Hispania from 25 BC onwards and in Dacia from 106 AD onwards. One of their largest mines was at Las Medulas in León (Spain), where seven long aqueducts enabled them to sluice most of a large alluvial deposit. The mines at Roşia Montană in Transylvania were also very large, and until very recently, still mined by opencast methods. They also exploited smaller deposits in Britain, such as placer and hard-rock deposits at Dolaucothi. The various methods they used are well described by Pliny the Elder in his encyclopedia Naturalis Historia written towards the end of the first century AD.</p>\n<p>During Mansa Musa's (ruler of the Mali Empire from 1312 to 1337) hajj to Mecca in 1324, he passed through Cairo in July 1324, and was reportedly accompanied by a camel train that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels where he gave away so much gold that it depressed the price in Egypt for over a decade. A contemporary Arab historian remarked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Gold was at a high price in Egypt until they came in that year. The mithqal did not go below 25 dirhams and was generally above, but from that time its value fell and it cheapened in price and has remained cheap till now. The mithqal does not exceed 22 dirhams or less. This has been the state of affairs for about twelve years until this day by reason of the large amount of gold which they brought into Egypt and spent there [...]</div>\n<div>—Chihab Al-Umari,&nbsp;<cite></cite></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Portuguese overseas expansion started in 1415 with the taking of Ceuta, to control the gold trade coming across the desert. Although the caravan trade routes were then diverted, the Portuguese continued expansing southwards along the coast and eventually buying the gold directly (or less indirectly) from the Africans in the Gulf of Guinea.</p>\n<p>The European exploration of the Americas was fueled in no small part by reports of the gold ornaments displayed in great profusion by Native American peoples, especially in Central America, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. The Aztecs regarded gold as literally the product of the gods, calling it \"god excrement\" (<i>teocuitlatl</i> in Nahuatl), and after Montezuma was killed, most of this gold was shipped to Spain. However, for the indigenous peoples of North America gold was considered useless and they saw much greater value in other minerals which were directly related to their utility, such as obsidian, flint, and slate.</p>\n<p>Gold played a role in western culture, as a cause for desire and of corruption, as told in children's fables like Rumplestiltskin, where the peasant's daughter turns hay into gold, in return for giving up her child when she becomes a princess, and stealing the hen that lays golden eggs in Jack and the beanstalk.</p>\n<p>The top prize at the Olympic games is the gold medal.</p>\n<p>There is an age-old tradition of biting gold to test its authenticity. Although this is certainly not a professional way of examining gold, the <i>bite test</i> was not to check if the coin was gold (90% gold coins are fairly strong) but to see if the coin was gold plated lead. A lead coin would be very soft and thus teeth marks would result. Fake gold coins were a common problem before 1932 so weighing a coin and also sliding a coin through a \"counterfeit detector\" slot was common (making a lead coin thicker would add weight thus why slide it through a measured slot). Most establishments (especially US Western saloons) would never accept a gold (or silver) coin of high value before weighing such an item.</p>\n<p>75% of all gold ever produced has been extracted since 1910. It has been estimated that all gold ever refined would form a single cube 20&nbsp;m (66&nbsp;ft) on a side (equivalent to 8,000 m).</p>\n<p>One main goal of the alchemists was to produce gold from other substances, such as lead&nbsp;— presumably by the interaction with a mythical substance called the philosopher's stone. Although they never succeeded in this attempt, the alchemists promoted an interest in what can be done with substances, and this laid a foundation for today's chemistry. Their symbol for gold was the circle with a point at its center (☉), which was also the astrological symbol and the ancient Chinese character for the Sun.</p>\n<p>Golden treasures have been rumored to be found at various locations, following tragedies such as the Jewish temple treasures in the Vatican, following the temple's destruction in 70 AD, a gold stash on the Titanic, the Nazi gold train – following World War II.</p>\n<p>The Dome of the Rock on the Jerusalem temple site is covered with an ultra-thin golden glasure. The Sikh Golden temple, the Harmandir Sahib, is a building covered with gold. Similarly the Wat Phra Kaew emerald Budha temple in Thailand has ornamental gold statues walls and roofs. Some European king and queen's crowns were made of gold, and gold was used for the bridal crown since antiquity. An ancient Talmudic text circa 100 AD describes Rachel, Rabbi Akiba's wife asking for a \"Jerusalem of Gold\" (crown). A Greek burial crown made of gold was found in a grave circa 370 BC.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThis 156-troy-ounce (4.9&nbsp;kg) nugget, known as the Mojave Nugget, was found by an individual prospector in the Southern California Desert using a metal detector.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Gold's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher atomic number elements which occur naturally. Like all elements with atomic numbers larger than iron, gold is thought to have been formed from a supernova nucleosynthesis process. Their explosions scattered metal-containing dusts (including heavy elements like gold) into the region of space in which they later condensed into our solar system and the Earth. Because the Earth was molten when it was just formed, almost all of the gold present on Earth sank into the core. Most of the gold that is present today in the Earth's crust and mantle was delivered to Earth by asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment.</p>\n<p>On Earth, gold is found in ores in rock formed from the Precambrian time onward. It most often occurs as a native metal, typically in a metal solid solution with silver (i.e. as a gold silver alloy). Such alloys usually have a silver content of 8–10%. Electrum is elemental gold with more than 20% silver. Electrum's color runs from golden-silvery to silvery, dependent upon the silver content. The more silver, the lower the specific gravity.</p>\n<p>Native gold occurs as very small to microscopic particles embedded in rock, often together with quartz or sulfide minerals such as \"Fool's Gold\", which is a pyrite. These are called lode deposits. The metal in a native state is also found in the form of free flakes, grains or larger nuggets that have been eroded from rocks and end up in alluvial deposits called placer deposits. Such free gold is always richer at the surface of gold-bearing veins owing to the oxidation of accompanying minerals followed by weathering, and washing of the dust into streams and rivers, where it collects and can be welded by water action to form nuggets.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRelative sizes of an 860 kg block of gold ore, and the 30 g of gold that can be extracted from it.

Note cubic shape of cavity.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Gold sometimes occurs combined with tellurium as the minerals calaverite, krennerite, nagyagite, petzite and sylvanite, and as the rare bismuthide maldonite (AuBi) and antimonide aurostibite (AuSb). Gold also occurs in rare alloys with copper, lead, and mercury: the minerals auricupride (CuAu), novodneprite (AuPb) and weishanite ((Au, Ag)Hg).</p>\n<p>Recent research suggests that microbes can sometimes play an important role in forming gold deposits, transporting and precipitating gold to form grains and nuggets that collect in alluvial deposits.</p>\n<p>Another recent study has claimed water in faults vaporizes during an earthquake, depositing gold. When an earthquake strikes, it moves along a fault. Water often lubricates faults, filling in fractures and jogs. About 6 miles (10 kilometers) below the surface, under incredible temperatures and pressures, the water carries high concentrations of carbon dioxide, silica, and gold. During an earthquake, the fault jog suddenly opens wider. The water inside the void instantly vaporizes, flashing to steam and forcing silica, which forms the mineral quartz, and gold out of the fluids and onto nearby surfaces.</p>\n<h3>Seawater</h3>\n<p>The world's oceans contain gold. Measured concentrations of gold in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific are 50–150 fmol/L or 10–30 parts per quadrillion (about 10–30 g/km). In general, gold concentrations for Atlantic and Pacific samples are the same (~50 fmol/L) but less certain. Mediterranean deep waters contain higher concentrations of gold (100–150 fmol/L) attributed to wind-blown dust and/or rivers. At 10 parts per quadrillion the Earth's oceans would hold 15,000 tonnes of gold. These figures are three orders of magnitude less than reported in the literature prior to 1988, indicating contamination problems with the earlier data.</p>\n<p>A number of people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from sea water, but so far they have all been either mistaken or acted in an intentional deception. Prescott Jernegan ran a gold-from-seawater swindle in the United States in the 1890s. A British fraudster ran the same scam in England in the early 1900s. Fritz Haber (the German inventor of the Haber process) did research on the extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay Germany's reparations following World War I. Based on the published values of 2 to 64 ppb of gold in seawater a commercially successful extraction seemed possible. After analysis of 4,000 water samples yielding an average of 0.004 ppb it became clear that the extraction would not be possible and he stopped the project. No commercially viable mechanism for performing gold extraction from sea water has yet been identified. Gold synthesis is not economically viable and is unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<h3>Specimens of crystalline native gold</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Native gold nuggets</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\"Rope gold\" from Lena River, Sakha Republic, Russia.

This can be represented by a cube with an edge length of about 20.28 meters. At $1,600 per ounce, 165,000 metric tonnes of gold would have a value of $8.8 trillion.</p>\n<p>World production for 2011 was at 2,700 tonnes, compared to 2,260 tonnes for 2008.</p>\n<p>Since the 1880s, South Africa has been the source for a large proportion of the world's gold supply, with about 50% of all gold ever produced having come from South Africa. Production in 1970 accounted for 79% of the world supply, producing about 1,480 tonnes. In 2007 China (with 276 tonnes) overtook South Africa as the world's largest gold producer, the first time since 1905 that South Africa has not been the largest.</p>\n<h2>Mining</h2>\n<div>Main article: Gold mining</div>\n<p>The city of Johannesburg located in South Africa was founded as a result of the Witwatersrand Gold Rush which resulted in the discovery of some of the largest gold deposits the world has ever seen. Gold fields located within the basin in the Free State and Gauteng provinces are extensive in strike and dip requiring some of the world's deepest mines, with the Savuka and TauTona mines being currently the world's deepest gold mine at 3,777 m. The Second Boer War of 1899–1901 between the British Empire and the Afrikaner Boers was at least partly over the rights of miners and possession of the gold wealth in South Africa.</p>\n<p>Other major producers are the United States, Australia, Russia and Peru. Mines in South Dakota and Nevada supply two-thirds of gold used in the United States. In South America, the controversial project Pascua Lama aims at exploitation of rich fields in the high mountains of Atacama Desert, at the border between Chile and Argentina. Today about one-quarter of the world gold output is estimated to originate from artisanal or small scale mining.</p>\n<h3>Prospecting</h3>\n<div>Main article: Gold prospecting</div>\n<p>During the 19th century, gold rushes occurred whenever large gold deposits were discovered. The first documented discovery of gold in the United States was at the Reed Gold Mine near Georgeville, North Carolina in 1803. The first major gold strike in the United States occurred in a small north Georgia town called Dahlonega. Further gold rushes occurred in California, Colorado, the Black Hills, Otago in New Zealand, Australia, Witwatersrand in South Africa, and the Klondike in Canada.</p>\n<h2>Extraction</h2>\n<div>Main article: Gold extraction</div>\n<p>Gold extraction is most economical in large, easily mined deposits. Ore grades as little as 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg (0.5 parts per million, ppm) can be economical. Typical ore grades in open-pit mines are 1–5&nbsp;mg/kg (1–5 ppm); ore grades in underground or hard rock mines are usually at least 3&nbsp;mg/kg (3 ppm). Because ore grades of 30&nbsp;mg/kg (30 ppm) are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye, in most gold mines the gold is invisible.</p>\n<p>The average gold mining and extraction costs were about US$317/oz in 2007, but these can vary widely depending on mining type and ore quality; global mine production amounted to 2,471.1 tonnes.</p>\n<h3>Refining</h3>\n<p>After initial production, gold is often subsequently refined industrially by the Wohlwill process which is based on electrolysis or by the Miller process, that is chlorination in the melt. The Wohlwill process results in higher purity, but is more complex and is only applied in small-scale installations. Other methods of assaying and purifying smaller amounts of gold include parting and inquartation as well as cupellation, or refining methods based on the dissolution of gold in aqua regia.</p>\n<h2>Synthesis from other elements</h2>\n<p>Gold was synthesized from mercury by neutron bombardment in 1941, but the isotopes of gold produced were all radioactive. In 1924, a Japanese physicist, Hantaro Nagaoka, accomplished the same feat.</p>\n<p>Gold can currently be manufactured in a nuclear reactor by irradiation either of platinum or mercury.</p>\n<p>Only the mercury isotope Hg, which occurs with a frequency of 0.15% in natural mercury, can be converted to gold by neutron capture, and following electron capture-decay into Au with slow neutrons. Other mercury isotopes are converted when irradiated with slow neutrons into one another, or formed mercury isotopes which beta decay into thallium.</p>\n<p>Using fast neutrons, the mercury isotope Hg, which composes 9.97% of natural mercury, can be converted by splitting off a neutron and becoming Hg, which then disintegrates to stable gold. This reaction, however, possesses a smaller activation cross-section and is feasible only with un-moderated reactors.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to eject several neutrons with very high energy into the other mercury isotopes in order to form Hg. However such high-energy neutrons can be produced only by particle accelerators..</p>\n<h2>Consumption</h2>\n<p>The consumption of gold produced in the world is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry.</p>\n<p>India is the world's largest single consumer of gold, as Indians buy about 25% of the world's gold, purchasing approximately 800 tonnes of gold every year, mostly for jewelry. India is also the largest importer of gold; in 2008, India imported around 400 tonnes of gold. Indian households hold 18,000 tonnes of gold which represents 11% of the global stock and worth more than $950 billion.</p>\n\n<h2>Pollution</h2>\n<p>Gold production is associated with contribution to hazardous pollution. The ore generally containing less than one ppm gold metal, is ground and mixed with sodium cyanide or mercury to react with gold in the ore for gold separation. Cyanide is highly poisonous chemical, which can kill living creatures when exposed in minute quantities. Many cyanide spills from gold mines have taken place worldwide both in developed and poor countries which killed the marine life in long stretches of affected rivers. Environmentalists consider these pollution disasters as major environmental disasters. When mercury is used in gold production, minute quantity of mercury compounds reach water bodies, causing heavy metal contamination of water. Mercury enters into the human food chain in the form of methyl mercury through fish, etc. Mercury poisoning in humans causes incurable brain function damage and severe retardation.</p>\n<p>Thirty tonnes of used ore is dumped as waste for producing one 1 ounce (28&nbsp;g) of gold. Gold ore dumps are the source of many heavy elements such as cadmium, lead, zinc, copper, arsenic, selenium and mercury. When sulfide bearing minerals in these ore dumps are exposed to air and water, the sulfide transforms into sulfuric acid which in turn dissolves these heavy metals facilitating their passage into surface water and ground water. This process is called acid mine drainage. The gold ore dumps are considered as long term man made hazardous waste next only to nuclear waste dumps.</p>\n<p>Gold extraction is also a highly energy intensive industry (25 kW·h of electricity per one gram of gold production) to extract ore from deep mines and to grind the large quantity of ore for further chemical extraction.</p>\n<h2>Chemistry</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGold (III) chloride solution in water</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Although gold is the most noble of the noble metals, it still forms many diverse compounds. The oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from −1 to +5, but Au(I) and Au(III) dominate its chemistry. Au(I), referred to as the aurous ion, is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers, thiolates, and tertiary phosphines. Au(I) compounds are typically linear. A good example is Au(CN), which is the soluble form of gold encountered in mining. Curiously, aurous complexes of water are rare. The binary gold halides, such as AuCl, form zigzag polymeric chains, again featuring linear coordination at Au. Most drugs based on gold are Au(I) derivatives.</p>\n<p>Au(III) (auric) is a common oxidation state, and is illustrated by gold(III) chloride, AuCl. The gold atom centers in Au(III) complexes, like other d compounds, are typically square planar, with chemical bonds that have both covalent and ionic character.</p>\n<p>Aqua regia, a 1:3 mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, dissolves gold. Nitric acid oxidizes the metal to +3 ions, but only in minute amounts, typically undetectable in the pure acid because of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. However, the ions are removed from the equilibrium by hydrochloric acid, forming AuCl ions, or chloroauric acid, thereby enabling further oxidation.</p>\n<p>Some free halogens react with gold. Gold also reacts in alkaline solutions of potassium cyanide. With mercury, it forms an amalgam.</p>\n<h3>Less common oxidation states</h3>\n<p>Less common oxidation states of gold include −1, +2, and +5.</p>\n<p>The −1 oxidation state occurs in compounds containing the Au anion, called aurides. Caesium auride (CsAu), for example, crystallizes in the caesium chloride motif. Other aurides include those of Rb, K, and tetramethylammonium (CH)N. Gold has the highest Pauling electronegativity of any metal, with a value of 2.54, making the auride anion relatively stable.</p>\n<p>Gold(II) compounds are usually diamagnetic with Au–Au bonds such as [Au(CH)P(CH)]Cl. The evaporation of a solution of Au(OH)\n3 in concentrated H\n2SO\n4 produces red crystals of gold(II) sulfate, Au(SO). Originally thought to be a mixed-valence compound, it has been shown to contain Au4+\n2 cations. A noteworthy, legitimate gold(II) complex is the tetraxenonogold(II) cation, which contains xenon as a ligand, found in [AuXe](SbF).</p>\n<p>Gold pentafluoride, along with its derivative anion, AuF−\n6, and its difluorine complex, gold heptafluoride, is the sole example of gold(V), the highest verified oxidation state.</p>\n<p>Some gold compounds exhibit <i>aurophilic bonding</i>, which describes the tendency of gold ions to interact at distances that are too long to be a conventional Au–Au bond but shorter than van der Waals bonding. The interaction is estimated to be comparable in strength to that of a hydrogen bond.</p>\n<h3>Mixed valence compounds</h3>\n<p>Well-defined cluster compounds are numerous. In such cases, gold has a fractional oxidation state. A representative example is the octahedral species {Au(P(CH))}. Gold chalcogenides, such as gold sulfide, feature equal amounts of Au(I) and Au(III).</p>\n<h2>Toxicity</h2>\n<p>Pure metallic (elemental) gold is non-toxic and non-irritating when ingested and is sometimes used as a food decoration in the form of gold leaf. Metallic gold is also a component of the alcoholic drinks Goldschläger, Gold Strike, and Goldwasser. Metallic gold is approved as a food additive in the EU (E175 in the Codex Alimentarius). Although the gold ion is toxic, the acceptance of metallic gold as a food additive is due to its relative chemical inertness, and resistance to being corroded or transformed into soluble salts (gold compounds) by any known chemical process which would be encountered in the human body.</p>\n<p>Soluble compounds (gold salts) such as gold chloride are toxic to the liver and kidneys. Common cyanide salts of gold such as potassium gold cyanide, used in gold electroplating, are toxic by virtue of both their cyanide and gold content. There are rare cases of lethal gold poisoning from potassium gold cyanide. Gold toxicity can be ameliorated with chelation therapy with an agent such as dimercaprol.</p>\n<p>Gold metal was voted Allergen of the Year in 2001 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. Gold contact allergies affect mostly women. Despite this, gold is a relatively non-potent contact allergen, in comparison with metals like nickel.</p>\n<h2>Price</h2>\n<div>Further information: Gold as an investment</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGold price history in 1960–2011</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Like other precious metals, gold is measured by troy weight and by grams. When it is alloyed with other metals the term <i>carat</i> or <i>karat</i> is used to indicate the purity of gold present, with 24 carats being pure gold and lower ratings proportionally less. The purity of a gold bar or coin can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from 0 to 1, known as the millesimal fineness, such as 0.995 being very pure.</p>\n<p>The price of gold is determined through trading in the gold and derivatives markets, but a procedure known as the Gold Fixing in London, originating in September 1919, provides a daily benchmark price to the industry. The afternoon fixing was introduced in 1968 to provide a price when US markets are open.</p>\n<p>Historically gold coinage was widely used as currency; when paper money was introduced, it typically was a receipt redeemable for gold coin or bullion. In a monetary system known as the gold standard, a certain weight of gold was given the name of a unit of currency. For a long period, the United States government set the value of the US dollar so that one troy ounce was equal to $20.67 ($664.56/kg), but in 1934 the dollar was devalued to $35.00 per troy ounce ($1125.27/kg). By 1961, it was becoming hard to maintain this price, and a pool of US and European banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further currency devaluation against increased gold demand.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA Swiss-cast 1 kg gold bar</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>On March 17, 1968, economic circumstances caused the collapse of the gold pool, and a two-tiered pricing scheme was established whereby gold was still used to settle international accounts at the old $35.00 per troy ounce ($1.13/g) but the price of gold on the private market was allowed to fluctuate; this two-tiered pricing system was abandoned in 1975 when the price of gold was left to find its free-market level. Central banks still hold historical gold reserves as a store of value although the level has generally been declining. The largest gold depository in the world is that of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank in New York, which holds about 3% of the gold ever mined, as does the similarly laden U.S. Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. In 2005 the World Gold Council estimated total global gold supply to be 3,859 tonnes and demand to be 3,754 tonnes, giving a surplus of 105 tonnes.</p>\n<p>Sometime around 1970 the price began in trend to greatly increase, and since 1968 the price of gold has ranged widely, from a high of $850/oz ($27,300/kg) on January 21, 1980, to a low of $252.90/oz ($8,131/kg) on June 21, 1999 (London Gold Fixing). The period from 1999 to 2001 marked the \"Brown Bottom\" after a 20-year bear market. Prices increased rapidly from 2001, but the 1980 high was not exceeded until January 3, 2008 when a new maximum of $865.35 per troy ounce was set. Another record price was set on March 17, 2008 at $1023.50/oz ($32,900/kg).</p>\n<p>In late 2009, gold markets experienced renewed momentum upwards due to increased demand and a weakening US dollar. On December 2, 2009, Gold reached a new high closing at $1,217.23. Gold further rallied hitting new highs in May 2010 after the European Union debt crisis prompted further purchase of gold as a safe asset. On March 1, 2011, gold hit a new all-time high of $1432.57, based on investor concerns regarding ongoing unrest in North Africa as well as in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Since April 2001 the gold price has more than quintupled in value against the US dollar, hitting a new all-time high of $1,913.50 on August 23, 2011, prompting speculation that this long secular bear market has ended and a bull market has returned.</p>\n<h2>Symbolism</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGold bars at the Emperor Casino in Macau</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Great human achievements are frequently rewarded with gold, in the form of gold medals, golden trophies and other decorations. Winners of athletic events and other graded competitions are usually awarded a gold medal. Many awards such as the Nobel Prize are made from gold as well. Other award statues and prizes are depicted in gold or are gold plated (such as the Academy Awards, the Golden Globe Awards, the Emmy Awards, the Palme d'Or, and the British Academy Film Awards).</p>\n<p>Aristotle in his ethics used gold symbolism when referring to what is now commonly known as the golden mean. Similarly, gold is associated with perfect or divine principles, such as in the case of the golden ratio and the golden rule.</p>\n<p>Gold is further associated with the wisdom of aging and fruition. The fiftieth wedding anniversary is golden. Our precious latter years are sometimes considered \"golden years\". The height of a civilization is referred to as a \"golden age\".</p>\n<p>In some forms of Christianity and Judaism, gold has been associated both with holiness and evil. In the Book of Exodus, the Golden Calf is a symbol of idolatry, while in the Book of Genesis, Abraham was said to be rich in gold and silver, and Moses was instructed to cover the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant with pure gold. In Byzantine iconography the halos of Christ, Mary and the Christian saints are often golden.</p>\n<p>Medieval kings were inaugurated under the signs of sacred oil and a golden crown, the latter symbolizing the eternal shining light of heaven and thus a Christian king's divinely inspired authority.</p>\n<p>According to Christopher Columbus, Those who had something of gold, were in possession of something of great value on Earth and a substance to even help souls to paradise.</p>\n<p>Wedding rings have long been made of gold. It is long lasting and unaffected by the passage of time and may aid in the ring symbolism of eternal vows before God and/or the sun and moon and the perfection the marriage signifies. In Orthodox Christian wedding ceremonies, the wedded couple is adorned with a golden crown (though some opt for wreaths, instead) during the ceremony, an amalgamation of symbolic rites.</p>\n<p>In popular culture gold holds many connotations but is most generally connected to terms such as good or great, such as in the phrases: \"has a heart of gold\", \"that's golden!\", \"golden moment\", \"then you're golden!\" and \"golden boy\".

  "title": "Thallium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with Thulium&nbsp;or Thorium.</div>\n\n<p><b>Thallium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Tl</b> and atomic number&nbsp;81. This soft gray post-transition metal is not found free in nature. When isolated, it resembles tin, but discolors when exposed to air. Chemists William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy discovered thallium independently in 1861, in residues of sulfuric acid production. Both used the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy, in which thallium produces a notable green spectral line. Thallium, from Greek θαλλός, thallos, meaning \"a green shoot or twig,\" was named by Crookes. It was isolated by electrolysis a year later, by Lamy.</p>\n<p>Thallium tends to oxidize to the +3 and +1 oxidation states as ionic salts. The +3 state resembles that of the other elements in thallium's group (boron, aluminum, gallium, indium). However, the +1 state, which is far more prominent in thallium than the elements above it, recalls the chemistry of alkali metals, and thallium(I) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores, and (when ingested) are handled in many ways like potassium ions (K) by ion pumps in living cells.</p>\n<p>Commercially, however, thallium is produced not from potassium ores, but as a byproduct from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores. Approximately 60–70% of thallium production is used in the electronics industry, and the remainder is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small, nontoxic amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan, during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test.</p>\n<p>Soluble thallium salts (many of which are nearly tasteless) are highly toxic in quantity, and were historically used in rat poisons and insecticides. Use of these compounds has been restricted or banned in many countries, because of their nonselective toxicity. Notably, thallium poisoning results in hair loss. Because of its historic popularity as a murder weapon, thallium has gained notoriety as \"the poisoner's poison\" and \"inheritance powder\" (alongside arsenic).</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Thallium is extremely soft, malleable and sectile enough to be cut with a knife at room temperature. It has a metallic luster that, when exposed to air, quickly tarnishes to a bluish-gray tinge, resembling lead. It may be preserved by immersion in oil. A heavy layer of oxide builds up on thallium if left in air. In the presence of water, thallium hydroxide is formed. Sulfuric and nitric acid dissolve thallium rapidly to make the sulfate and nitrate salts, while hydrochloric acid forms an insoluble thallium(I) chloride layer. Its standard electrode potential is −0.34, slightly higher than the potential for iron (at −0.44).</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of thallium</div>\n<p>Thallium has 25 isotopes which have atomic masses that range from 184 to 210. Tl and Tl are the only stable isotopes, and Tl is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 3.78 years.</p>\n<p>Tl (half-life 12.23 days) can be made in a cyclotron, while Tl is made by the neutron activation of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor.</p>\n<p>Tl (half-life 73 hrs), decays by electron capture, emitting Hg X-rays (~70–80&nbsp;keV), and photons of 135 and 167&nbsp;keV in 10% total abundance; therefore it has good imaging characteristics without excessive patient radiation dose. It is the most popular isotope used for thallium nuclear cardiac stress tests.</p>\n<p>Tl (half-life 3.05 minutes) is generated in the naturally-occurring thorium decay chain. Its prominent 2615 keV gamma ray is the dominant high-energy feature observed in natural background radiation.</p>\n<h3>Chemistry</h3>\n<div>See also category: Thallium compounds</div>\n<p>The two main oxidation states of thallium are +1 and +3. In the oxidation state +1 most compounds closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds (the ionic radius of thallium(I) is 1.47&nbsp;Å while that of potassium is 1.33&nbsp;Å and that of silver is 1.26&nbsp;Å), which was the reason why thallium was sometimes considered to be an alkali metal in Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery. For example, the water-soluble and very basic thallium(I) hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide forming water-soluble thallium carbonate. This carbonate is the only water soluble heavy metal carbonate. The similarity with silver compounds is observed with the halide, oxide, and sulfide compounds. Thallium(I) bromide is a photosensitive yellow compound very similar to the silver bromide, while the black thallium(I) oxide and thallium(I) sulfide are very similar to the silver oxide and silver sulfide.</p>\n<p>The compounds with oxidation state +3 resemble the corresponding aluminium(III) compounds. They are moderately strong oxidizing agents, as illustrated by the reduction potential of +0.72 volts for Tl + 3 e → Tl(<i>s</i>). The thallium(III) oxide is a black solid which decomposes above 800&nbsp;°C, forming the thallium(I) oxide and oxygen.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Thallium (Greek θαλλός, thallos, meaning \"a green shoot or twig\") was discovered by flame spectroscopy in 1861. The name comes from thallium's bright green spectral emission lines.</p>\n<p>After the publication of the improved method of flame spectroscopy by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff and the discovery of caesium and rubidium in the years 1859 to 1860, flame spectroscopy became an approved method to determine the composition of minerals and chemical products. William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy both started to use the new method. William Crookes used it to make spectroscopic determinations for tellurium on selenium compounds deposited in the lead chamber of a sulfuric acid production plant near Tilkerode in the Harz mountains. He had obtained the samples for his research on selenium cyanide from August Hofmann years earlier. By 1862, Crookes was able to isolate small quantities of the new element and determine the properties of a few compounds. Claude-Auguste Lamy used a spectrometer that was similar to Crookes' to determine the composition of a selenium-containing substance which was deposited during the production of sulfuric acid from pyrite. He also noticed the new green line in the spectra and concluded that a new element was present. Lamy had received this material from the sulfuric acid plant of his friend Fréd Kuhlmann and this by-product was available in large quantities. Lamy started to isolate the new element from that source. The fact that Lamy was able to work ample quantities of thallium enabled him to determine the properties of several compounds and in addition he prepared a small ingot of metallic thallium which he prepared by remelting thallium he had obtained by electrolysis of thallium salts.</p>\n<p>As both scientists discovered thallium independently and a large part of the work, especially the isolation of the metallic thallium was done by Lamy, Crookes tried to secure his priority on the work. Lamy was awarded a medal at the International Exhibition in London 1862: <i>For the discovery of a new and abundant source of thallium</i> and after heavy protest Crookes also received a medal: <i>thallium, for the discovery of the new element.</i> The controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863. Most of the discussion ended after Crookes was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863.</p>\n<p>The dominant use of thallium was the use as poison for rodents. After several accidents the use as poison was banned in the United States by the Presidential Executive Order 11643 in February 1972. In the subsequent years several other countries also banned the use.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<p>Although thallium is a modestly abundant element in the Earth's crust, with a concentration estimated to be about 0.7&nbsp;mg/kg, mostly in association with potassium-based minerals in clays, soils, and granites, thallium is not generally economically recoverable from these sources. The major source of thallium for practical purposes is the trace amount that is found in copper, lead, zinc, and other heavy-metal-sulfide ores.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCrystals of hutchinsonite (TlPbAsS)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Thallium is found in the minerals crookesite TlCuSe, hutchinsonite TlPbAsS, and lorandite TlAsS. Thallium also occurs as a trace element in iron pyrite, and thallium is extracted as a by-product of roasting this mineral for the production of sulfuric acid.</p>\n<p>Thallium can also be obtained from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor also contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been and continues to be prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the environment of the oceans. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. However, these minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium was ever actively mined. This deposit still contains a loosely estimated 500&nbsp;tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorandite.</p>\n<p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the annual worldwide production of thallium is about 10&nbsp;metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. Thallium is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected at the end of the smelting process. The raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step. The thallium is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is several times precipitated from the solution and to remove further impurities. At the end it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates. The production of thallium decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15&nbsp;metric tonnes to about 10&nbsp;tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it would be possible to increase the production of it if a new application, such as a hypothetical thallium-containing high-temperature superconductor, becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Historic uses</h3>\n<p>The odorless and tasteless thallium sulfate was once widely used as rat poison and ant killer. Since 1972 this use has been prohibited in the United States due to safety concerns. Many other countries followed this example in the following years. Thallium salts were used in the treatment of ringworm, other skin infections and to reduce the night sweating of tuberculosis patients. However this use has been limited due to their narrow therapeutic index, and the development of more advanced medicines for these conditions.</p>\n<h3>Optics</h3>\n<p>Thallium(I) bromide and thallium(I) iodide crystals have been used as infrared optical materials, because they are harder than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths. The trade name KRS-5 refers to this material. Thallium(I) oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a high index of refraction. Combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic, thallium has been used in the production of high-density glasses that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 °C. These glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices.</p>\n<h3>Electronics</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCorroded thallium rod</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Thallium(I) sulfide's electrical conductivity changes with exposure to infrared light therefore making this compound useful in photoresistors. Thallium selenide has been used in a bolometer for infrared detection. Doping selenium semiconductors with thallium improves their performance, and therefore it is used in trace amounts in selenium rectifiers. Another application of thallium doping is the sodium iodide crystals in gamma radiation detection devices. In these, the sodium iodide crystals are doped with a small amount of thallium to improve their efficiency as scintillation generators. Some of the electrodes in dissolved oxygen analyzers contain thallium.</p>\n<h3>High-temperature superconductivity</h3>\n<p>Research activity with thallium is ongoing to develop high-temperature superconducting materials for such applications as magnetic resonance imaging, storage of magnetic energy, magnetic propulsion, and electric power generation and transmission. The research in applications started after the discovery of the first thallium barium calcium copper oxide superconductor in 1988.</p>\n<h3>Medical</h3>\n<p>Before the widespread application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, was the main substance for nuclear cardiography. The nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator which is similar to the technetium-99m generator. The generator contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours) which decays by electron capture to the thallium-201. The lead-201 can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by the (p,3n) and (d,4n) reactions.</p>\n<h4>Thallium stress test</h4>\n<p>A thallium stress test is a form of scintigraphy, where the amount of thallium in tissues correlates with tissue blood supply. Viable cardiac cells have normal Na/K ion exchange pumps. The Tl cation binds the K pumps and is transported into the cells. Exercise or dipyridamole induces widening (vasodilation) of normal coronary arteries. This produces coronary steal from areas where arteries are maximally dilated. Areas of infarct or ischemic tissue will remain \"cold\". Pre- and post-stress thallium may indicate areas which will benefit from myocardial revascularization. Redistribution indicates the existence of coronary steal and the presence of ischemic coronary artery disease.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>A mercury-thallium alloy, which forms a eutectic at 8.5% thallium, is reported to freeze at&nbsp;−60&nbsp;°C, some 20&nbsp;°C below the freezing point of mercury. This alloy is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones, olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates in magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths to increase the speed of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.</p>\n<p>The saturated solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(CHO)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(CHO)) in water is known as Clerici solution. It is a mobile odorless liquid whose color changes from yellowish to clear upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts. With the density of 4.25&nbsp;g/cm at 20&nbsp;°C, Clerici solution is one of the heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century for measuring density of minerals by the flotation method, but the use is discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.</p>\n<p>Thallium iodide is used as an additive to metal halide lamps, often together with one-two halides of other metals. It allows to optimize the lamp temperature and color rendering, and shift the spectral output to the green region, which is useful for underwater lighting.</p>\n<h2>Toxicity</h2>\n<div>Main article: Thallium poisoning</div>\n<p>Thallium and its compounds are extremely toxic, and should be handled with great care. There are numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium poisoning. Contact with skin is dangerous, and adequate ventilation should be provided when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure to them should not exceed 0.1&nbsp;mg per m of skin in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were easily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxications caused by accident or criminal intent.</p>\n<h2>Treatment and internal decontamination</h2>\n<p>One of the main methods of removing thallium (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use Prussian blue, a material which absorbs thallium. Up to 20&nbsp;g per day of Prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person, and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the stool. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stage of the treatment additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissue.</p>\n<h2>Thallium pollution</h2>\n<p>According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), man-made sources of thallium pollution include gaseous emission of cement factories, coal burning power plants, and metal sewers. The main source of elevated thallium concentrations in water is the leaching of thallium from ore processing operations.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^      \"Chemical fact sheet&nbsp;— Thallium\".

  "html": "<div>This article is about the metal.  For other uses, see Lead (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Lead</b> is a chemical element in the carbon group with symbol&nbsp;<b>Pb</b> (from Latin: plumbum) and atomic number&nbsp;82. Lead is a soft and malleable metal, which is regarded as a heavy metal and poor metal. Metallic lead has a bluish-white color after being freshly cut, but it soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air. Lead has a shiny chrome-silver luster when it is melted into a liquid.</p>\n<p>Lead is used in building construction, lead-acid batteries, bullets and shot, weights, as part of solders, pewters, fusible alloys, and as a radiation shield. Lead has the highest atomic number of all of the stable elements, although the next higher element, bismuth, has a half-life that is so long (much longer than the age of the universe) that it can be considered stable. Its four stable isotopes have 82 protons, a magic number in the nuclear shell model of atomic nuclei.</p>\n<p>Lead, at certain contact degrees, is a poisonous substance to animals, including humans. It damages the nervous system and causes brain disorders. Excessive lead also causes blood disorders in mammals. Like the element mercury, another heavy metal, lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates both in soft tissues and the bones. Lead poisoning has been documented from ancient Rome, ancient Greece, and ancient China.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA sample of freshly solidified lead (from molten state)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Lead is a bright and silvery metal with a very slight shade of blue in a dry atmosphere. Upon contact with air, it begins to tarnish by forming a complex mixture of compounds depending on the conditions. The color of the compounds can vary. The tarnish layer can contain significant amounts of carbonates and hydroxycarbonates. It has a few characteristic properties: high density, softness, ductility and malleability, poor electrical conductivity compared to other metals, high resistance to corrosion, and ability to react with organic chemicals.</p>\n<p>Various traces of other metals change its properties significantly: the addition of small amounts of antimony or copper to lead increases the alloy's hardness and improves corrosion resistance from sulfuric acid. A few other metals also improve only hardness and fight metal fatigue, such as cadmium, tin, or tellurium; metals like sodium or calcium also have this ability, but they weaken the chemical stability. Finally, zinc and bismuth simply impair the corrosion resistance (0.1% bismuth content is the industrial usage threshold). In return, lead impurities mostly worsen the quality of industrial materials, although there are exceptions: for example, small amounts of lead improve the ductility of steel.</p>\n<p>Lead has only one common allotrope, which is face-centered cubic, with the lead–lead distance being 349&nbsp;pm. At 327.5&nbsp;°C (621.5&nbsp;°F), lead melts; the melting point is above that of tin (232&nbsp;°C, 449.5&nbsp;°F), but significantly below that of germanium (938&nbsp;°C, 1721&nbsp;°F). The boiling point of lead is 1749&nbsp;°C (3180&nbsp;°F), which is below those of both tin (2602&nbsp;°C, 4716&nbsp;°F) and germanium (2833&nbsp;°C, 5131&nbsp;°F). Densities increase down the group: the Ge and Sn values (5.23 and 7.29&nbsp;g·cm, respectively) are significantly below that of lead: 11.32&nbsp;g·cm.</p>\n<p>A lead atom has 82 electrons, having an electronic configuration of [Xe]4f5d6s6p. In its compounds, lead (unlike the other group 14 elements) most commonly loses its two and not four outermost electrons, becoming lead(II) ions, Pb. Such unusual behavior is rationalized by considering the inert pair effect, which occurs because of the stabilization of the 6s-orbital due to relativistic effects, which are stronger closer to the bottom of the periodic table. Tin shows a weaker such effect: tin(II) is still a reducer.</p>\n<p>The figures for electrode potential show that lead is only slightly easier to oxidize than hydrogen. Lead thus can dissolve in acids, but this is often impossible due to specific problems (such as the formation of insoluble salts). Powdered lead burns with a bluish-white flame. As with many metals, finely divided powdered lead exhibits pyrophoricity. Toxic fumes are released when lead is burned.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of lead</div>\n<p>Lead occurs naturally on Earth exclusively in the form of four isotopes: lead-204, -206, -207, and -208. All four can be radioactive as the hypothetical alpha decay of any would be exothermic, but the lower half-life limit has been put only for lead-204: over 1.4×10&nbsp;years. This effect is, however, so weak that natural lead poses no radiation hazard. Three isotopes are also found in three of the four major decay chains: lead-206, -207 and -208 are final decay products of uranium-238, uranium-235, and thorium-232, respectively. Since the amounts of them in nature depend also on other elements' presence, the isotopic composition of natural lead varies by sample: in particular, the relative amount of lead-206 varies between 20.84% and 27.78%.</p>\n<p>Aside from the stable ones, thirty-four radioisotopes have been synthesized: they have mass numbers of 178–215. Lead-205 is the most stable radioisotope of lead, with a half-life of over 10&nbsp;years. 47 nuclear isomers (long-lived excited nuclear states), corresponding to 24 lead isotopes, have been characterized. The most long-lived isomer is lead-204m2 (half-life of about 1.1&nbsp;hours).</p>\n<h3>Chemical reactivity</h3>\n<p>Lead is classified as a post-transition metal and is also a member of the carbon group. Lead only forms a protective oxide layer although finely powdered highly purified lead can ignite in air. Melted lead is oxidized in air to lead monoxide. All chalcogens oxidize lead upon heating.</p>\n<p>Fluorine does not oxidize cold lead. Hot lead can be oxidized, but the formation of a protective halide layer lowers the intensity of the reaction above 100&nbsp;°C (210&nbsp;°F). The reaction with chlorine is similar: thanks to the chloride layer, lead persistence against chlorine surpasses those of copper or steel up to 300&nbsp;°C (570&nbsp;°F).</p>\n<p>Water in the presence of oxygen attacks lead to start an accelerating reaction. The presence of carbonates or sulfates results in the formation of insoluble lead salts, which protect the metal from corrosion. So does carbon dioxide, as the insoluble lead carbonate is formed; however, an excess of the gas leads to the formation of the soluble bicarbonate; this makes the use of lead pipes dangerous. Lead dissolves in organic acids (in the presence of oxygen) and concentrated (≥80%) sulfuric acid thanks to complexation; however, it is only weakly affected by hydrochloric acid and is stable against hydrofluoric acid, as the corresponding halides are weakly soluble. Lead also dissolves in quite concentrated alkalis (≥10%) because of the amphoteric character and solubility of plumbites.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>Main article: Compounds of lead</div>\n<p>Lead compounds exist mainly in two main oxidation states, +2 and +4. The former is more common. Inorganic lead(IV) compounds are typically strong oxidants or exist only in highly acidic solutions.</p>\n<h3>Oxides and sulfides</h3>\n<p>Three oxides are known: lead(II) oxide or lead monoxide (PbO), lead tetroxide (PbO) (sometimes called \"minium\"), and lead dioxide (PbO). The monoxide exists as two allotropes: α-PbO and β-PbO, both with layer structure and tetracoordinated lead. The alpha polymorph is red-colored and has the Pb–O distance of 230&nbsp;pm; the beta polymorph is yellow-colored and has the Pb–O distance of 221 and 249&nbsp;pm (due to asymmetry). Both polymorphs can exist under standard conditions (beta with small (10 relative) impurities, such as Si, Ge, Mo, etc.). PbO reacts with acids to form salts, and with alkalis to give plumbites, [Pb(OH)] or [Pb(OH)]. The monoxide oxidizes in air to trilead tetroxide, which at 550&nbsp;°C (1020&nbsp;°F) degrades back into PbO.</p>\n<p>The dioxide may be prepared by, for example, halogenization of lead(II) salts. Regardless the polymorph, it has a black-brown color. The alpha allotrope is rhombohedral, and the beta allotrope is tetragonal. Both allotropes are black-brown in color and always contain some water, which cannot be removed, as heating also causes decomposition (to PbO and PbO). The dioxide is a powerful oxidizer: it can oxidize hydrochloric and sulfuric acids. It does not react with alkaline solution, but reacts with solid alkalis to give hydroxyplumbates, or with basic oxides to give plumbates.</p>\n<p>Reaction of lead salts with hydrogen sulfide yields lead monosulfide. The solid has the rocksalt-like simple cubic structure, which it keeps up to the melting point, 1114&nbsp;°C (2037&nbsp;°F). When heated in air, it oxidizes to the sulfate and then the monoxide. Lead monosulfide is almost insoluble in water, weak acids, and (NH)S/(NH)S solution is the key for separation of lead from analytical groups I to III ions, tin, arsenic, and antimony. However, it dissolves in nitric and hydrochloric acids, to give elemental sulfur and hydrogen sulfide, respectively. Upon heating under high pressures with sulfur, it gives the disulfide. In the compound, the lead atoms are linked octahedrally with the sulfur atoms. It is also a semiconductor. A mixture of the monoxide and the monosulfide when heated forms the metal.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 PbO + PbS → 3 Pb + SO</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Halides and other salts</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA 3&nbsp;kg lead weight used on a scuba diving weight belt.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Heating lead carbonate with hydrogen fluoride yields the hydrofluoride, which decomposes to the difluoride when it melts. This white crystalline powder is more soluble than the diiodide, but less than the dibromide and the dichloride. The tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is unstable.</p>\n<p>Other dihalides are obtained upon heating lead(II) salts with the halides of other metals; lead dihalides precipitate to give white orthorhombic crystals (diiodide forms yellow hexagonal crystals). They can also be obtained by direct reaction of their constituent elements at temperature exceeding melting points of dihalides. Their solubility increases with temperature; adding more halides first decreases the solubility, but then increases due to complexation, with the maximum coordination number being 6. The complexation depends on halide ion numbers, atomic number of the alkali metal, the halide of which is added, temperature and solution ionic strength. The tetrachloride is obtained upon dissolving the dioxide in hydrochloric acid; to prevent the exothermic decomposition, it is kept under concentrated sulfuric acid. The tetrabromide may not, and the tetraiodide definitely does not exist. The diastatide has also been prepared.</p>\n<p>The metal is not attacked by sulfuric or hydrochloric acids. It dissolves in nitric acid with the evolution of nitric oxide gas to form dissolved Pb(NO). It is a well-soluble solid in water; it is thus a key to receive the precipitates of halides, sulfate, chromate, carbonate, and basic carbonate Pb(OH)(CO) salts of lead. |</p>\n<h3>Organolead</h3>\n<div>Main article: Organolead compound</div>\n<p>The best-known compounds are the two simplest plumbane derivatives: tetramethyllead (TML) and tetraethyllead (TEL). The homologs of these, as well as hexaethyldilead (HEDL), are of lesser stability. The tetralkyl derivatives contain lead(IV), where the Pb–C bonds are covalent. They thus resemble typical organic compounds.</p>\n<p>Lead readily forms an equimolar alloy with sodium metal that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds of lead such as tetraethyllead. The Pb–C bond energies in TML and TEL are only 167 and 145&nbsp;kJ/mol; the compounds thus decompose upon heating, with first signs of TEL composition seen at 100&nbsp;°C (210&nbsp;°F). The pyrolysis yields of elemental lead and alkyl radicals; their interreaction causes the synthesis of HEDL. TML and TEL also decompose upon sunlight or UV light. In presence of chlorine, the alkyls begin to be replaced with chlorides; the RPbCl in the presence of HCl (a by-product of the previous reaction) leads to the complete mineralization to give PbCl. Reaction with bromine follows the same principle.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld lead production peaking in the Roman period and the rising Industrial Revolution</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLead ingots from Roman Britain on display at the Wells and Mendip Museum</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLead mining in the upper Mississippi River region of the US in 1865</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Lead has been commonly used for thousands of years because it is widespread, easy to extract and easy to work with. It is highly malleable as well as easy to smelt. Metallic lead beads dating back to 6400 BCE have been found in Çatalhöyük in modern-day Turkey. In the early Bronze Age, lead was used with antimony and arsenic.</p>\n<p>The largest preindustrial producer of lead was the Roman economy, with an estimated annual output of 80,000 tonnes, which was typically won as a by-product of extensive silver smelting. Roman mining activities occurred in Central Europe, Roman Britain, the Balkans, Greece, Asia Minor and Hispania which alone accounted for 40% of world production.</p>\n<p>Roman lead pipes often bore the insignia of Roman emperors (see Roman lead pipe inscriptions). Lead plumbing in the Latin West may have been continued beyond the age of Theoderic the Great into the medieval period. Many Roman \"pigs\" (ingots) of lead figure in Derbyshire lead mining history and in the history of the industry in other English centers. The Romans also used lead in molten form to secure iron pins that held together large limestone blocks in certain monumental buildings. In alchemy, lead was thought to be the oldest metal and was associated with the planet Saturn. Alchemists accordingly used Saturn's symbol (the scythe, ♄) to refer to lead.</p>\n<p>Up to the 17th century, tin was often not distinguished from lead: lead was called <i>plumbum nigrum</i> (literally, \"black lead\"), while tin was called <i>plumbum candidum</i> (literally, \"bright lead\"). Their inherence through history can also be seen in other languages: the word \"olovo\" means lead in Czech, but in Russian it (\"олово\") means tin. Lead's symbol Pb is an abbreviation of its Latin name <i>plumbum</i> for soft metals; the English words \"plumbing\", \"plumber\", \"plumb\", and \"plumb-bob\" also derive from this Latin root.</p>\n<p>Lead production in the US commenced as early as the late 1600s by Indians in the The Southeast Missouri Lead District, commonly called the Lead Belt, is a lead mining district in the southeastern part of Missouri. Significant among Missouri's lead mining concerns in the district was the Desloge Family and Desloge Consolidated Lead Company in Desloge, Missouri and Bonne Terre – having been active in lead trading, mining and lead smelting from 1823 in Potosi to 1929.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLead and zinc bearing carbonate and clastic deposits.

Lead is usually found in ore with zinc, silver and (most abundantly) copper, and is extracted together with these metals. The main lead mineral is galena (PbS), which contains 86.6% lead by weight. Other common varieties are cerussite (PbCO) and anglesite (PbSO).</p>\n<h3>Ore processing</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGalena, lead ore</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Most ores contain less than 10% lead, and ores containing as little as 3% lead can be economically exploited. Ores are crushed and concentrated by froth flotation typically to 70% or more. Sulfide ores are roasted, producing primarily lead oxide and a mixture of sulfates and silicates of lead and other metals contained in the ore. Lead oxide from the roasting process is reduced in a coke-fired blast furnace to the metal. Additional layers separate in the process and float to the top of the metallic lead. These are slag (silicates containing 1.5% lead), matte (sulfides containing 15% lead), and speiss (arsenides of iron and copper). These wastes contain concentrations of copper, zinc, cadmium, and bismuth that can be recovered economically, as can their content of unreduced lead.</p>\n<p>Metallic lead that results from the roasting and blast furnace processes still contains significant contaminants of arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, silver, and gold. The melt is treated in a reverberatory furnace with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the contaminants except silver, gold, and bismuth. The oxidized contaminants are removed by drossing, where they float to the top and are skimmed off. Since lead ores contain significant concentrations of silver, the smelted metal also is commonly contaminated with silver. Metallic silver as well as gold is removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process. Desilvered lead is freed of bismuth according to the Betterton-Kroll process by treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium, which forms a bismuth dross that can be skimmed off. Very pure lead can be obtained by processing smelted lead electrolytically by means of the Betts process. The process uses anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead in an electrolyte of silica fluoride.</p>\n<h3>Production and recycling</h3>\n<p>Production and consumption of lead is increasing worldwide. Total annual production is about 8&nbsp;million tonnes; about half is produced from recycled scrap. The top lead producing countries, as of 2008, are Australia, China, USA, Peru, Canada, Mexico, Sweden, Morocco, South Africa and North Korea. Australia, China and the United States account for more than half of primary production. In 2010, 9.6 million tonnes of lead were produced, of which 4.1 million tonnes came from mining.</p>\n<p>At current use rates, the supply of lead is estimated to run out in 42 years. Environmental analyst Lester Brown has suggested lead could run out within 18 years based on an extrapolation of 2% growth per year. This may need to be reviewed to take account of renewed interest in recycling, and rapid progress in fuel cell technology. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of lead in use in society is 8&nbsp;kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (20–150&nbsp;kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (1–4&nbsp;kg per capita).</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Elemental form</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLead bricks are commonly used as radiation shielding.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, pencil leads in wooden pencils have never been made from lead. The term comes from the Roman stylus, called the <i>penicillus</i>, a small brush used for painting. When the pencil originated as a wrapped graphite writing tool, the particular type of graphite being used was named plumbago (lit. <i>act for lead</i>, or <i>lead mockup</i>).</p>\n<p>Lead is used in applications where its low melting point, ductility and high density are advantageous. The low melting point makes casting of lead easy, and therefore small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment. It is also inexpensive and denser than other common metals.</p>\n<p>Because of its high density and resistance from corrosion, lead is used for the ballast keel of sailboats. Its high density allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails while at the same time occupying a small volume and thus offering the least underwater resistance. For the same reason it is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's natural buoyancy and that of his equipment. It does not have the weight-to-volume ratio of many heavy metals, but its low cost increases its use in these and other applications.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRoman lead water pipes with taps</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLead pipe in Roman baths</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMulticolor lead-glazing in a Tang dynasty Chinese <i>sancai</i> ceramic cup dating from the 8th century CE</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPunched lead cast in a Venice bridge wall fixing the hard-metal connecting bar</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>More than half of the US lead production (at least 1.15 million tonnes in 2000) is used for automobiles, mostly as electrodes in the lead–acid battery, used extensively as a car battery.</p>\n<p>Cathode (reduction)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>PbO + 4 H + SO2−\n4 + 2e → PbSO + 2 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Anode (oxidation)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Pb + SO2−\n4 → PbSO + 2e</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Lead is used as electrodes in the process of electrolysis. It is used in solder for electronics, although this usage is being phased out by some countries to reduce the amount of environmentally hazardous waste, and in high voltage power cables as sheathing material to prevent water diffusion into insulation. Lead is one of three metals used in the Oddy test for museum materials, helping detect organic acids, aldehydes, and acidic gases. It is also used as shielding from radiation (e.g., in X-ray rooms). Molten lead is used as a coolant (e.g., for lead cooled fast reactors).</p>\n<p>Lead is added to brass to reduce machine tool wear. In the form of strips, or tape, lead is used for the customization of tennis rackets. Tennis rackets of the past sometimes had lead added to them by the manufacturer to increase weight. It is also used to form glazing bars for stained glass or other multi-lit windows. The practice has become less common, not for danger but for stylistic reasons. Lead, or <i>sheet-lead</i>, is used as a sound deadening layer in some areas in wall, floor and ceiling design in sound studios where levels of airborne and mechanically produced sound are targeted for reduction or virtual elimination. It is the traditional base metal of organ pipes, mixed with varying amounts of tin to control the tone of the pipe.</p>\n<p>Lead has many uses in the construction industry (e.g., lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, flashing, gutters and gutter joints, and on roof parapets). Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs used to fix lead sheet. Lead is still widely used in statues and sculptures. Lead is often used to balance the wheels of a car; this use is being phased out in favor of other materials for environmental reasons. Owing to its half-life of 22.20 years, the radioactive isotope Pb is used for dating material from marine sediment cores by radiometric methods.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<p>Lead compounds are used as a coloring element in ceramic glazes, notably in the colors red and yellow. Lead is frequently used in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic, which coats electrical cords.</p>\n<p>Lead is used in some candles to treat the wick to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of the dangers, European and North American manufacturers use more expensive alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide. It changes the optical characteristics of the glass and reduces the transmission of radiation.</p>\n<p>Some artists using oil-based paints continue to use lead carbonate white, citing its properties in comparison with the alternatives. Tetra-ethyl lead is used as an anti-knock additive for aviation fuel in piston-driven aircraft. Lead-based semiconductors, such as lead telluride, lead selenide and lead antimonide are finding applications in photovoltaic (solar energy) cells and infrared detectors.</p>\n<p>Lead, in either pure form or alloyed with tin, or antimony is the traditional material for bullets and shot in firearms use.</p>\n<h3>Former applications</h3>\n<p>Lead pigments were used in lead paint for white as well as yellow, orange, and red. Most uses have been discontinued due of the dangers of lead poisoning. Beginning April 22, 2010, US federal law requires that contractors performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb more than six square feet of paint in homes, child care facilities, and schools built before 1978 must be certified and trained to follow specific work practices to prevent lead contamination. Lead chromate is still in industrial use. Lead carbonate (white) is the traditional pigment for the priming medium for oil painting, but it has been largely displaced by the zinc and titanium oxide pigments. It was also quickly replaced in water-based painting mediums. Lead carbonate white was used by the Japanese geisha and in the West for face-whitening make-up, which was detrimental to health.</p>\n<p>Lead was the principal component of the alloy used in hot metal typesetting. It was used for plumbing (hence the name) as well as a preservative for food and drink in Ancient Rome. Until the early 1970s, lead was used for joining cast iron water pipes and used as a material for small diameter water pipes.</p>\n<p>Tetraethyllead was used in leaded fuels to reduce engine knocking, but this practice has been phased out across many countries of the world in efforts to reduce toxic pollution that affected humans and the environment.</p>\n<p>Lead was used to make bullets for slings. Lead was used for shotgun pellets in the US until about 1992 when it was outlawed (for waterfowl hunting only) and replaced by non-toxic shot, primarily steel pellets. In the Netherlands, the use of lead shot for hunting and sport shooting was banned in 1993, which caused a large drop in lead emission, from 230 tonnes in 1990 to 47.5 tonnes in 1995, two years after the ban.</p>\n<p>Lead was a component of the paint used on children's toys – now restricted in the United States and across Europe (ROHS Directive). Lead was used in car body filler, which was used in many custom cars in the 1940s–60s. Hence the term Leadsled. Lead is a superconductor with a transition temperature of 7.2&nbsp;K, and therefore IBM tried to make a Josephson effect computer out of a lead alloy.</p>\n<p>Lead was also used in pesticides before the 1950s, when fruit orchards were treated especially against the codling moth. A lead cylinder attached to a long line was used by sailors for the vital navigational task of determining water depth by <i>heaving the lead</i> at regular intervals. A soft tallow insert at its base allowed the nature of the sea bed to be determined, further aiding position finding.</p>\n<h2>Health effects</h2>\n<div>Main article: Lead poisoning</div>\n<p>Lead is a highly poisonous metal (regardless if inhaled or swallowed), affecting almost every organ and system in the body. The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous system, both in adults and children. Long-term exposure of adults can result in decreased performance in some tests that measure functions of the nervous system. Long-term exposure to lead or its salts (especially soluble salts or the strong oxidant PbO) can cause nephropathy, and colic-like abdominal pains. It may also cause weakness in fingers, wrists, or ankles. Lead exposure also causes small increases in blood pressure, particularly in middle-aged and older people and can cause anemia. Exposure to high lead levels can severely damage the brain and kidneys in adults or children and ultimately cause death. In pregnant women, high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage. Chronic, high-level exposure have shown to reduce fertility in males. Lead also damages nervous connections (especially in young children) and cause blood and brain disorders. Lead poisoning typically results from ingestion of food or water contaminated with lead; but may also occur after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint. It is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and is believed to have adverse effects on the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, kidneys, and the immune system. The component limit of lead (1.0 μg/g) is a test benchmark for pharmaceuticals, representing the maximum daily intake an individual should have. However, even at this low level, a prolonged intake can be hazardous to human beings. The treatment for lead poisoning consists of dimercaprol and succimer.</p>\n\n<p>The concern about lead's role in cognitive deficits in children has brought about widespread reduction in its use (lead exposure has been linked to learning disabilities). Most cases of adult elevated blood lead levels are workplace-related. High blood levels are associated with delayed puberty in girls. Lead has been shown many times to permanently reduce the cognitive capacity of children at extremely low levels of exposure.</p>\n<p>During the 20th century, the use of lead in paint pigments was sharply reduced because of the danger of lead poisoning, especially to children. By the mid-1980s, a significant shift in lead end-use patterns had taken place. Much of this shift was a result of the U.S. lead consumers' compliance with environmental regulations that significantly reduced or eliminated the use of lead in non-battery products, including gasoline, paints, solders, and water systems. Lead use is being further curtailed by the European Union's RoHS directive. Lead may still be found in harmful quantities in stoneware, vinyl (such as that used for tubing and the insulation of electrical cords), and Chinese brass. Older houses may still contain substantial amounts of lead paint. White lead paint has been withdrawn from sale in industrialized countries, but the yellow lead chromate is still in use. Old paint should not be stripped by sanding, as this produces inhalable dust.</p>\n<p>Lead salts used in pottery glazes have on occasion caused poisoning, when acidic drinks, such as fruit juices, have leached lead ions out of the glaze. It has been suggested that what was known as \"Devon colic\" arose from the use of lead-lined presses to extract apple juice in the manufacture of cider. Lead is considered to be particularly harmful for women's ability to reproduce. Lead(II) acetate (also known as <i>sugar of lead</i>) was used in the Roman Empire as a sweetener for wine, and some consider this a plausible explanation for the dementia of many Roman emperors, and, that chronic lead poisoning contributed to the empire's gradual decline. (see Decline of the Roman Empire#Lead poisoning)</p>\n<h3>Biochemistry of poisoning</h3>\n<p>In the human body, lead inhibits porphobilinogen synthase and ferrochelatase, preventing both porphobilinogen formation and the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX, the final step in heme synthesis. This causes ineffective heme synthesis and subsequent microcytic anemia. At lower levels, it acts as a calcium analog, interfering with ion channels during nerve conduction. This is one of the mechanisms by which it interferes with cognition. Acute lead poisoning is treated using disodium calcium edetate: the calcium chelate of the disodium salt of ethylene-diamine-tetracetic acid (EDTA). This chelating agent has a greater affinity for lead than for calcium and so the lead chelate is formed by exchange. This is then excreted in the urine leaving behind harmless calcium. According to the Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry, a small amount of ingested lead (1%) will store itself in bones, and the rest will be excreted by an adult through urine and feces within a few weeks of exposure. However, only about 32% of lead will be excreted by a child.</p>\n<p>Exposure to lead and lead chemicals can occur through inhalation, ingestion and dermal contact. Most exposure occurs through ingestion or inhalation; in the U.S. the skin exposure is unlikely as leaded gasoline additives are no longer used. Lead exposure is a global issue as lead mining and lead smelting are common in many countries. Most countries have stopped using lead-containing gasoline by 2007. Lead exposure mostly occurs through ingestion. Lead paint is the major source of lead exposure for children. As lead paint deteriorates, it peels, is pulverized into dust and then enters the body through hand-to-mouth contact or through contaminated food, water or alcohol. Ingesting certain home remedy medicines may also expose people to lead or lead compounds. Lead can be ingested through fruits and vegetables contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil is contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint and residual emissions from leaded gasoline that was used before the Environment Protection Agency issue the regulation around 1980. The use of lead for water pipes is problematic in areas with soft or (and) acidic water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes while soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes. Inhalation is the second major pathway of exposure, especially for workers in lead-related occupations. Almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body, the rate is 20–70% for ingested lead; children absorb more than adults. Dermal exposure may be significant for a narrow category of people working with organic lead compounds, but is of little concern for general population. The rate of skin absorption is also low for inorganic lead.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance</li>\n<li>Lead-Free Toys Act</li>\n<li>Medical geology</li>\n<li>Plumbosolvency</li>\n<li>RoHS directive</li>\n<li>Banning of leaded petrol</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^       Polyanskiy 1986, p.&nbsp;18.</li>\n<li>^ Thurmer, K.; Williams, E; Reutt-Robey, J.

  "title": "Bismuth",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Bismuth</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Bi</b> and atomic number&nbsp;83. Bismuth, a pentavalent poor metal, chemically resembles arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but is often seen in air with a pink tinge owing to surface oxidation. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.</p>\n<p>Bismuth metal has been known from ancient times, although until the 18th century it was often confused with lead and tin, which share some physical properties. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly comes from Arabic <i>bi ismid</i>, meaning having the properties of antimony or German words <i>weisse masse</i> or <i>wismuth</i> (\"white mass\"), translated in the mid sixteenth century to New Latin <i>bisemutum</i>.</p>\n<p>Bismuth has long been considered as the element with the highest atomic mass that is stable. However, it was recently discovered to be slightly radioactive: its only primordial isotope bismuth-209 decays with a half life more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe.</p>\n<p>Bismuth compounds account for about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably Pepto-Bismol. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently about a third of bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The name <i>bismuth</i> is from ca. 1660s, and is of uncertain etymology. It is one of the first 10 metals to have been discovered. Bismuth appears in the 1660s, from obsolete German <i>Bismuth</i>, <i>Wismut</i>, <i>Wissmuth</i> (early 16th century); perhaps related to Old High German <i>hwiz</i> (\"white\"). The New Latin <i>bisemutum</i> (due to Georgius Agricola, who Latinized many German mining and technical words) is from the German <i>Wismuth</i>, perhaps from <i>weiße Masse</i>, \"white mass.\" The element was confused in early times with tin and lead because of its resemblance to those elements. Bismuth has been known since ancient times, so no one person is credited with its discovery. Agricola, in De Natura Fossilium (ca. 1546) states that bismuth is a distinct metal in a family of metals including tin and lead. This was based on observation of the metals and their physical properties. Miners in the age of alchemy also gave bismuth the name <i>tectum argenti,</i> or \"silver being made,\" in the sense of silver still in the process of being formed within the Earth.</p>\n<p>Beginning with Johann Heinrich Pott in 1738, Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Torbern Olof Bergman the distinctness of lead and bismuth became clear and Claude François Geoffroy demonstrated in 1753 that this metal is distinct from lead and tin. Bismuth was also known to the Incas and used (along with the usual copper and tin) in a special bronze alloy for knives.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBismuth crystal illustrating the many iridescent refraction hues of its oxide surface</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nArtificially grown bismuth crystal illustrating the stair-step crystal structure, with a 1-cm cube of bismuth metal</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Physical characteristics</h3>\n<p>Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often occurring in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals is the result of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.</p>\n<p>No other metal is verified to be more naturally diamagnetic than bismuth. (Superdiamagnetism is a different physical phenomenon.) Of any metal, it has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity (after manganese, and maybe neptunium and plutonium) and the highest Hall coefficient. It has a high electrical resistance. When deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate, bismuth is a semiconductor, rather than a poor metal.</p>\n<p>Elemental bismuth is one of very few substances of which the liquid phase is denser than its solid phase (water being the best-known example). Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, it was long a component of low-melting typesetting alloys, where it compensated for the contraction of the other alloying components, to form almost isostatic bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.</p>\n<p>Though virtually unseen in nature, high-purity bismuth can form distinctive, colorful hopper crystals. It is relatively nontoxic and has a low melting point just above 271&nbsp;°C, so crystals may be grown using a household stove, although the resulting crystals will tend to be lower quality than lab-grown crystals.</p>\n<p>At ambient conditions bismuth crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice (Pearson symbol hR6, space group R3m No. 166), which is often classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems. When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure changes first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the body-centered cubic Bi-IV at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity; they are rather reproducible and abrupt, and are therefore used for calibration of high-pressure equipment.</p>\n<h3>Chemical characteristics</h3>\n<p>Bismuth is stable to both dry and moist air at ordinary temperatures. When red-hot, it reacts with water to make bismuth(III) oxide.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Bi + 3 HO → BiO + 3 H</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It reacts with fluorine to make bismuth(V) fluoride at 500 °C or bismuth(III) fluoride at lower temperatures (typically from Bi melts); with other halogens it yields only bismuth(III) halides. The trihalides are corrosive and easily react with moisture, forming oxyhalides with the formula BiOX.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Bi + 3 X → 2 BiX (X = F, Cl, Br, I)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Bismuth dissolves in concentrated sulfuric acid to make bismuth(III) sulfate and sulfur dioxide.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>6 HSO + 2 Bi → 6 HO + Bi(SO) + 3 SO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It reacts with nitric acid to make bismuth(III) nitrate.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Bi + 6 HNO → 3 HO + 3 NO + Bi(NO)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It also dissolves in hydrochloric acid, but only with oxygen present.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>4 Bi + 3 O + 12 HCl → 4 BiCl + 6 HO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It is used as a transmetalating agent in the synthesis of alkaline-earth metal complexes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>3 Ba + 2 BiPh → 3 BaPh + 2 Bi</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of bismuth</div>\n<p>The only primordial isotope of bismuth, bismuth-209, was traditionally regarded as the heaviest stable isotope, but it had long been suspected to be unstable on theoretical grounds. This was finally demonstrated in 2003, when researchers at the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale in Orsay, France, measured the alpha emission half-life of 209Bi to be 1.9×10&nbsp;years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe. Owing to its extraordinarily long half-life, for all presently known medical and industrial applications, bismuth can be treated as if it is stable and nonradioactive. The radioactivity is of academic interest because bismuth is one of few elements whose radioactivity was suspected and theoretically predicted, before being detected in the laboratory. Bismuth has the longest known alpha decay half-life, although tellurium-128 has a double beta decay half-life of over 2.2×10&nbsp;years.</p>\n<p>Several isotopes of bismuth with short half-lives occur within the radioactive disintegration chains of actinium, radium, and thorium, and more have been synthesized experimentally. Bismuth-213 is also found on the decay chain of uranium-233.</p>\n<p>Commercially, the radioactive isotope bismuth-213 can be produced by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.</p>\n<h2>Chemical compounds</h2>\n<div>See also category: Bismuth compounds</div>\n<p>Bismuth forms trivalent and pentavalent compounds, the trivalent ones being more common. Many of its chemical properties are similar to those of arsenic and antimony, although they are less toxic than derivatives of those lighter elements.</p>\n<h3>Oxides and sulfides</h3>\n<p>At elevated temperatures, the vapors of the metal combine rapidly with oxygen, forming the yellow trioxide, Bi\n2O\n3. When molten, at temperatures above 710 °C, this oxide corrodes any metal oxide, and even platinum. On reaction with base, it forms two series of oxyanions: BiO−\n2, which is polymeric and forms linear chains, and BiO3−\n3. The anion in Li\n3BiO\n3 is actually a cubic octameric anion, Bi\n8O24−\n24, whereas the anion in Na\n3BiO\n3 is tetrameric.</p>\n<p>The dark red bismuth(V) oxide, Bi\n2O\n5, is unstable, liberating O\n2 gas upon heating.</p>\n<p>Bismuth sulfide, Bi\n2S\n3, occurs naturally in bismuth ores. It is also produced by the combination of molten bismuth and sulfur.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) structure (mineral bismoclite). Bismuth atoms shown as grey, oxygen red, chlorine green.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl, see figure at right) and bismuth oxynitate (BiONO) stoichiometrically appear as simple anionic salts of the bismuthyl(III) cation (BiO) which commonly occurs in aqueous bismuth compounds. However, in the case of BiOCl, the salt crystal forms in a structure of alternating plates of Bi, O, and Cl atoms, with each oxygen coordinating with four bismuth atoms in the adjacent plane. This mineral compound is used as a pigment and cosmetic (see below).</p>\n<h3>Bismuthine and bismuthides</h3>\n<p>Unlike earlier members of group 15 elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic, and similar to the previous group 15 element antimony, bismuth does not form a stable hydride. Bismuth hydride, bismuthine (BiH\n3), is an endothermic compound that spontaneously decomposes at room temperature. It is stable only below −60&nbsp;°C. Bismuthides are intermetallic compounds between bismuth and other metals.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<p>The halides of bismuth in low oxidation states have been shown to adopt unusual structures. What was originally thought to be bismuth(I) chloride, BiCl, turns out to be a complex compound consisting of Bi5+\n9 cations and BiCl2−\n5 and Bi\n2Cl2−\n8 anions. The Bi5+\n9 cation has a distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry, and is also found in Bi\n10Hf\n3Cl\n18, which is prepared by reducing a mixture of hafnium(IV) chloride and bismuth chloride with elemental bismuth, having the structure [Bi+] [Bi5+\n9] [HfCl2−\n6]\n3. Other polyatomic bismuth cations are also known, such as Bi2+\n8, found in Bi\n8(AlCl\n4)\n2. Bismuth also forms a low-valence bromide with the same structure as \"BiCl\". There is a <i>true</i> monoiodide, BiI, which contains chains of Bi\n4I\n4 units. BiI decomposes upon heating to the triiodide, BiI\n3, and elemental bismuth. A monobromide of the same structure also exists. In oxidation state +3, bismuth forms trihalides with all of the halogens: BiF\n3, BiCl\n3, BiBr\n3, and BiI\n3. All of these except BiF\n3 are hydrolyzed by water to form the <i>bismuthyl</i> cation, BiO+, the commonly encountered bismuth(III) oxycation noted above.</p>\n<p>Bismuth(III) chloride reacts with hydrogen chloride in ether solution to produce the acid HBiCl\n4.</p>\n<p>The oxidation state +5 is less frequently encountered. One such compound is BiF\n5, a powerful oxidizing and fluorinating agent. It is also a strong fluoride acceptor, reacting with xenon tetrafluoride to form the XeF+\n3 cation:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>BiF\n5 + XeF\n4 → XeF+\n3BiF−\n6</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Aqueous species</h3>\n<p>In aqueous solution, the Bi3+ ion exists in various states of hydration, depending on the pH:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These mononuclear species are in equilibrium. Polynuclear species also exist, the most important of which is BiO+, which exists in hexameric form as the octahedral complex [Bi\n6O\n4(OH)\n4]6+ (or 6&nbsp;[BiO+]·2&nbsp;H\n2O).</p>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBismite mineral</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In the Earth's crust, bismuth is about twice as abundant as gold. The most important ores of bismuth are bismuthinite and bismite. Native bismuth is known from Australia, Bolivia, and China.</p>\n<p>According to the United States Geological Survey, the world mining production of bismuth in 2010 was 8,900 tonnes, with the major contributions from China (6,500 tonnes), Peru (1,100 tonnes) and Mexico (850 tonnes). The refinery production was 16,000 tonnes, of which China produced 13,000, Mexico 850 and Belgium 800 tonnes. The difference reflects bismuth's status as a byproduct of extraction of other metals such as lead, copper, tin, molybdenum and tungsten.</p>\n<p>Bismuth travels in crude lead bullion (which can contain up to 10% bismuth) through several stages of refining, until it is removed by the Kroll-Betterton process which separates the impurities as slag, or the electrolytic Betts process. Bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals, copper. The raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals, foremost lead. By reacting the molten mixture with chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged. Impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high-purity bismuth metal (over 99% Bi). World bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic.</p>\n<h3>Price</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld mine production and annual averages of bismuth price (New York, not adjusted for inflation).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The price for pure bismuth metal has been relatively stable through most of the 20th century, except for a spike in the 1970s. Bismuth has always been produced mainly as a byproduct of lead refining, and thus the price, usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.</p>\n<p>Demand for bismuth was small prior to World War II and was pharmaceutical – bismuth compounds were used to treat such conditions as digestive disorders, sexually transmitted diseases and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) during the war and at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.</p>\n<p>In the early 1970s, the price grew rapidly due to increasing demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium, iron and steel. This was followed by a decline owing to increased world production, stabilized consumption, and the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82. In 1984, the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide, especially in the United States and Japan. In the early 1990s, research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic glazes, fishing sinkers, food-processing equipment, free-machining brasses for plumbing applications, lubricating greases, and shot for waterfowl hunting. Growth in these areas remained slow during the middle 1990s, in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the US Government, but intensified around 2005. This resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price.</p>\n<h3>Recycling</h3>\n<p>Whereas bismuth is most available today as a byproduct, its sustainability is more dependent on recycling. Bismuth is mostly a byproduct of lead smelting, along with silver, zinc, antimony, and other metals, and also of tungsten production, along with molybdenum and tin, and also of copper production. Recycling bismuth is difficult in many of its end uses, primarily because of scattering.</p>\n<p>Probably the easiest to recycle would be bismuth-containing fusible alloys in the form of larger objects, then larger soldered objects. Half of the world's solder consumption is in electronics (i.e., circuit boards). As the soldered objects get smaller or contain little solder or little bismuth, the recovery gets progressively more difficult and less economic, although solder with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering. Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, perhaps as bismuth phosphomolybdate, and then bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.</p>\n<p>Bismuth in uses where it is dispersed most widely include stomach medicines (bismuth subsalicylate), paints (bismuth vanadate) on a dry surface, pearlescent cosmetics (bismuth oxychloride), and bismuth-containing bullets that have been fired. The bismuth scattered in these uses is unrecoverable with present technology.</p>\n<p>The most important sustainability fact about bismuth is its byproduct status, which can either improve sustainability (i.e., vanadium or manganese nodules) or, for bismuth from lead ore, constrain it; bismuth is constrained. The extent that the constraint on bismuth can be ameliorated or not is going to be tested by the future of the lead storage battery, since 90% of the world market for lead is in storage batteries for gasoline or diesel-powered motor vehicles.</p>\n<p>The life-cycle assessment of bismuth will focus on solders, one of the major uses of bismuth, and the one with the most complete information. The average primary energy use for solders is around 200 MJ per kg, with the high-bismuth solder (58% Bi) only 20% of that value, and three low-bismuth solders (2% to 5% Bi) running very close to the average. The global warming potential averaged 10 to 14&nbsp;kg carbon dioxide, with the high-bismuth solder about two-thirds of that and the low-bismuth solders about average. The acidification potential for the solders is around 0.9 to 1.1&nbsp;kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, with the high-bismuth solder and one low-bismuth solder only one-tenth of the average and the other low-bismuth solders about average. There is very little life-cycle information on other bismuth alloys or compounds.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Bismuth has few commercial applications, none of which is particularly large. Taking the US as an example, 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics), 26% into metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing, 7% into bismuth alloys, solders and ammunition, and the balance into research and other uses.</p>\n<p>Some manufacturers use bismuth as a substitute in equipment for potable water systems such as valves to meet \"lead-free\" mandates in the U.S. (starts in 2014). This is a fairly large application since it covers all residential and commercial building construction.</p>\n<p>In the early 1990s, researchers began to evaluate bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in various applications.</p>\n<h3>Medicine</h3>\n<p>Bismuth is an ingredient in some pharmaceuticals, although the use of some of these substances is declining.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bismuth subsalicylate is used as an antidiarrheal; it is the active ingredient in such \"Pink Bismuth\" preparations as Pepto-Bismol, as well as the 2004 reformulation of Kaopectate. It is also used to treat some other gastro-intestinal diseases. The mechanism of action of this substance is still not well documented, although an oligodynamic effect (toxic effect of small doses of heavy metal ions on microbes) may be involved in at least some cases. Salicylic acid from hydrolysis of the compound is antimicrobial for toxogenic <i>E. coli,</i> an important pathogen in traveler's diarrhea.</li>\n<li>a combination of bismuth subsalicylate and bismuth subcitrate are used to treat peptic ulcers.</li>\n<li>Bibrocathol is an organic bismuth-containing compound used to treat eye infections.</li>\n<li>Bismuth subgallate, the active ingredient in Devrom, is used as an internal deodorant to treat malodor from flatulence (\"gas\") and feces.</li>\n<li>Bismuth compounds (including sodium bismuth tartrate) were formerly used to treat syphilis</li>\n<li>\"Milk of bismuth\" (an aqueous solution of bismuth hydroxide and bismuth subcarbonate) was marketed as an ailimentary cureall in the early 20th century</li>\n<li>Bismuth subnitrate (BiO(OH)(NO)) and bismuth subcarbonate (BiO(CO)) are also used in medicine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cosmetics and pigments</h3>\n<p>Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) is sometimes used in cosmetics, as a pigment in paint for eye shadows, hair sprays and nail polishes. This compound is found as the mineral bismoclite and in crystal form contains layers of atoms (see figure above) that refract light chromatically, resulting in an iridescent appearance similar to nacre of pearl. It was used as a cosmetic in ancient Egypt and in many places since. <i>Bismuth white</i> (also \"Spanish white\") can refer to either bismuth oxychloride or bismuth oxynitrate (BiONO), when used as a white pigment.</p>\n<h3>Metal and alloys</h3>\n<h4>Lead replacement</h4>\n<p>The density difference between lead (density 11.32&nbsp;g·cm) and bismuth (density 9.78&nbsp;g·cm) is small enough that for many ballistics and weighting applications, bismuth can substitute for lead. For example, it can replace lead as a dense material in fishing sinkers. It has been used as a replacement for lead in shot, bullets and less-lethal riot gun ammunition. The Netherlands, Denmark, England, Wales, the US, and many other countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds, as many birds are prone to lead poisoning owing to mistaken ingestion of lead (instead of small stones and grit) to aid digestion, or even prohibit the use of lead for all hunting, such as in the Netherlands. Bismuth-tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead. (Another less expensive but also more poorly performing alternative is \"steel\" shot, which is actually soft iron.) Bismuth's lack of malleability does, however, make it unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets.</p>\n<p>Bismuth, as a dense element of high atomic weight, is used in bismuth-impregnated latex shields to shield from X-ray in medical examinations, such as CTs, mostly as it is considered non-toxic.</p>\n<p>The European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) for reduction of lead has broadened bismuth's use in electronics as a component of low-melting point solders, as a replacement for traditional tin-lead solders. Its low toxicity will be especially important for solders to be used in food processing equipment and copper water pipes, although it can also be used in other applications including those in the automobile industry, in the EU for example.</p>\n<p>Bismuth has been evaluated as a replacement for lead in free-machining brasses for plumbing applications, although it does not equal the performance of leaded steels.</p>\n<h4>Other metal uses and specialty alloys</h4>\n<p>Many bismuth alloys have low melting points and are found in specialty applications such as solders. Many automatic sprinklers, electric fuses, and safety devices in fire detection and suppression systems contain the eutectic In19.1-Cd5.3-Pb22.6-Sn8.3-Bi44.7 alloy that melts at 47 °C (117&nbsp;°F) This is a convenient temperature since it unlikely to be exceeded in normal living conditions. Low-melting alloys, such as Bi-Cd-Pb-Sn alloy which melts at 70 °C, are also used in automotive and aviation industries. Before deforming a thin-walled metal part, it is filled with a melt or covered with a thin layer of the alloy to reduce the chance of breaking. Then the alloy is removed by submerging the part in boiling water.</p>\n<p>Bismuth is used to make free-machining steels and free-machining aluminium alloys for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead and the expansion of bismuth compensates each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.</p>\n<p>Bismuth also is used in Aluminum-Silicon cast alloy in order to refining Si morphology. However, it indicated a poisoning effect on modification of strontium (Sr). Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of Cs cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300 °C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100&nbsp;kHz range and in magnetic memory devices.</p>\n<h3>Other uses as compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBismuth vanadate, a yellow pigment</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Bismuth is included in BSCCO (bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide) which is a group of similar superconducting compounds discovered in 1988 that exhibit the highest superconducting transition temperatures.</li>\n<li>Bismuth subnitrate is a component of glazes that produces an iridescence and is used as a pigment in paint.</li>\n<li>Bismuth telluride is a semiconductor and an excellent thermoelectric material. BiTe diodes are used in mobile refrigerators, CPU coolers, and as detectors in infrared spectrophotometers.</li>\n<li>Bismuth oxide, in its delta form, is a solid electrolyte for oxygen. This form normally only exists above and breaks down below a high-temperature threshold, but can be electrodeposited well below this temperature in a highly alkaline solution.</li>\n<li>Bismuth vanadate is an opaque yellow pigment in artists' oil and acrylic paint. This compound is a non-toxic lightfast substitute for lemon yellow pigments such as the cadmium sulfides and the lead/strontium/barium chromates. Unlike lead chromate+lead sulfate lemon, bismuth vanadate does not readily blacken with UV exposure.</li>\n<li>A catalyst for making acrylic fibers.</li>\n<li>Ingredient in lubricating greases.</li>\n<li>In crackling microstars (dragon's eggs) in pyrotechnics, as the oxide, subcarbonate or subnitrate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Toxicology and ecotoxicology</h2>\n<p>Scientific literature concurs that bismuth and most of its compounds are less toxic compared to other heavy metals (lead, antimony, etc.) and that it is not bioaccumulative. They have low solubilities in the blood, are easily removed with urine, and showed no carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic effects in long-term tests on animals (up to 2 years). Its biological half-life for whole-body retention is 5 days but it can remain in the kidney for years in patients treated with bismuth compounds.</p>\n<p>Bismuth poisoning exists and mostly affects the kidney, liver, and bladder. Skin and respiratory irritation can also follow exposure to respective organs. As with lead, overexposure to bismuth can result in the formation of a black deposit on the gingiva, known as a bismuth line.</p>\n<p>Bismuth's environmental impacts are not very well known. It is considered that its environmental impact is small, due in part to the low solubility of its compounds. Limited information however means that a close eye should be kept on its impact.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lead-bismuth eutectic</li>\n<li>Bismuth minerals</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   Cucka, P.; Barrett, C.

  "title": "Polonium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Polonium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Po</b> and atomic number 84, discovered in 1898 by Maria Skłodowska-Curie and Pierre Curie. A rare and highly radioactive element with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to bismuth and tellurium, and it occurs in uranium ores. Applications of polonium are few, and include heaters in space probes, antistatic devices, and sources of neutrons and alpha particles. Because of its position in the periodic table, polonium is sometimes classified as a metalloid. However, other sources say that on the basis of its properties and behavior, it is \"unambiguously a metal\".</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of polonium</div>\n<p>Polonium has 33 known isotopes, all of which are radioactive. They have atomic masses that range from 188 to 220 u. Po (half-life 138.376 days) is the most widely available. Po (half-life 103 years) and Po (half-life 2.9 years) can be made through the alpha, proton, or deuteron bombardment of lead or bismuth in a cyclotron.</p>\n<p>Po is an alpha emitter that has a half-life of 138.4 days; it decays directly to its stable daughter isotope, Pb. A milligram of Po emits about as many alpha particles per second as 5&nbsp;grams of Ra. A few curies (1 curie equals 37 gigabecquerels, 1 Ci = 37 GBq) of Po emit a blue glow which is caused by excitation of surrounding air.</p>\n<p>About one in 100,000 alpha emissions causes an excitation in the nucleus which then results in the emission of a gamma ray with a maximum energy of 803 keV. However, it is the alpha particles, not the side effect of an occasional gamma ray, that results in Po decay. The gamma radiation level from polonium is below the normal background.</p>\n<h3>Solid state form</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe alpha form of solid polonium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Polonium is a radioactive element that exists in two metallic allotropes. The alpha form is the only known example of a simple cubic crystal structure in a single atom basis, with an edge length of 335.2 picometers; the beta form is rhombohedral. The structure of polonium has been characterized by X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction.</p>\n<p>Po (in common with Pu) has the ability to become airborne with ease: if a sample is heated in air to 55 °C (131 °F), 50% of it is vaporized in 45 hours, even though the melting point of polonium is 254 °C (489 °F) and its boiling point is 962 °C (1763 °F). More than one hypothesis exists for how polonium does this; one suggestion is that small clusters of polonium atoms are spalled off by the alpha decay.</p>\n<h3>Chemistry</h3>\n<p>The chemistry of polonium is similar to that of tellurium and bismuth. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids, but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po into Po. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed.</p>\n<h4>Compounds</h4>\n<p>Polonium has no common compounds, and almost all of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of those are known. The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. NaPo has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the wurtzite and MgPo the nickel arsenide structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600 °C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300 °C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000 °C. For example PrPo melts at 1250 °C and TmPo at 2200 °C. PbPo is one of the very few naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium alpha decays to form lead.</p>\n<p>Polonium hydride (PoH\n2) is a volatile liquid at room temperature prone to dissociation. The two oxides PoO and PoO are the products of oxidation of polonium.</p>\n<p>Halides of the structure PoX, PoX and PoX are known. They are soluble in the corresponding hydrogen halides, i.e., PoCl in HCl, PoBr in HBr and PoI in HI. Polonium dihalides are formed by direct reaction of the elements or by reduction of PoCl with SO and with PoBr with HS at room temperature. Tetrahalides can be obtained by reacting polonium dioxide with HCl, HBr or HI.</p>\n<p>Other polonium compounds include acetate, bromate, carbonate, citrate, chromate, cyanide, formate, hydroxide, nitrate, selenate, monosulfide, sulfate and disulfate.</p>\n\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Also tentatively called \"Radium F\", polonium was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898 and was named after Marie Curie's native land of Poland (Latin: Polonia) Poland at the time was under Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian partition, and did not exist as an independent country. It was Curie's hope that naming the element after her native land would publicize its lack of independence. Polonium may be the first element named to highlight a political controversy.</p>\n<p>This element was the first one discovered by the Curies while they were investigating the cause of pitchblende radioactivity. The pitchblende, after removal of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium, was more radioactive than both the uranium and thorium put together. This spurred the Curies on to find additional radioactive elements. The Curies first separated out polonium from the pitchblende in July 1898, and five months later, also isolated radium.</p>\n<p>In the United States, polonium was produced as part of the Manhattan Project during World War II. It was a critical part of the implosion-type nuclear weapon design used in the Fat Man bomb on Nagasaki in 1945. Polonium and beryllium were the key ingredients of the 'urchin' detonator at the center of the bomb's spherical plutonium pit. The urchin ignited the nuclear chain reaction at the moment of prompt-criticality to ensure the bomb did not fizzle.</p>\n<p>Much of the basic physics of polonium was classified until after the war. The fact that it was used as an initiator was classifed until the 1960s.</p>\n<p>The Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project funded human experiments using polonium on 5 people at the University of Rochester between 1943 and 1947. The people were administered between 9 and 22 microcuries of polonium to study its excretion.</p>\n<h2>Detection</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEmission intensity vs. photon energy for three polonium isotopes.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Gamma counting</h3>\n<p>By means of radiometric methods such as gamma spectroscopy (or a method using a chemical separation followed by an activity measurement with a non-energy-dispersive counter), it is possible to measure the concentrations of radioisotopes and to distinguish one from another. In practice, background noise would be present and depending on the detector, the line width would be larger which would make it harder to identify and measure the isotope. In biological/medical work it is common to use the natural K present in all tissues/body fluids as a check of the equipment and as an internal standard.</p>\n<h3>Alpha counting</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEmission intensity vs. alpha energy for four isotopes, note that the line width is narrow and the fine details can be seen.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The best way to test for (and measure) many alpha emitters is to use alpha-particle spectroscopy as it is common to place a drop of the test solution on a metal disk which is then dried out to give a uniform coating on the disk. This is then used as the test sample. If the thickness of the layer formed on the disk is too thick then the lines of the spectrum are broadened, this is because some of the energy of the alpha particles is lost during their movement through the layer of active material. An alternative method is to use internal liquid scintillation where the sample is mixed with a scintillation cocktail. When the light emitted is then counted, some machines will record the amount of light energy per radioactive decay event. Due to the imperfections of the liquid scintillation method (such as a failure of all the photons to be detected, cloudy or coloured samples can be difficult to count) and the fact that random quenching can reduce the number of photons generated per radioactive decay it is possible to get a broadening of the alpha spectra obtained through liquid scintillation. It is likely that these liquid scintillation spectra will be subject to a Gaussian broadening rather than the distortion exhibited when the layer of active material on a disk is too thick.</p>\n<p>A third energy dispersive method for counting alpha particles is to use a semiconductor detector.</p>\n<p>From left to right the peaks are due to Po, Po, Pu and Am. The fact that isotopes such as Pu and Am have more than one alpha line indicates that the nucleus has the ability to be in different discrete energy levels (like a molecule can).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEmission intensity vs. alpha energy for four isotopes, note that the line width is wide and some of the fine details can not be seen. This is for liquid scintillation counting where random effects cause a variation in the number of visible photons generated per alpha decay.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Occurrence and production</h2>\n<p>Polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short half-life of all its isotopes. It is found in uranium ores at about 0.1&nbsp;mg per metric ton (1 part in 10), which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium. The amounts in the Earth's crust are not harmful. Polonium has been found in tobacco smoke from tobacco leaves grown with phosphate fertilizers.</p>\n<p>Because of the small abundance, isolation of polonium from natural sources is a very tedious process. The largest batch was extracted in the first half of the 20th century by processing 37 tonnes of residues from radium production. It contained only 40 Ci (9&nbsp;mg) of polonium-210. Nowadays, polonium is obtained by irradiating bismuth with high-energy neutrons or protons.</p>\n<h3>Neutron capture</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Synthesis by (n,γ) reaction</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1934 an experiment showed that when natural Bi is bombarded with neutrons, Bi is created, which then decays to Po via beta-minus decay. The final purification is done pyrochemically followed by liquid-liquid extraction techniques. Polonium may now be made in milligram amounts in this procedure which uses high neutron fluxes found in nuclear reactors. Only about 100&nbsp;grams are produced each year, practically all of it in Russia, making polonium exceedingly rare.</p>\n<p>This process can cause problems in lead-bismuth based liquid metal cooled nuclear reactors such as those used in the Soviet Navy's K-27. Measures must be taken in these reactors to deal with the unwanted possibility of Po being released from the coolant.</p>\n<h3>Proton capture</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Synthesis by (p,n) and (p,2n) reactions</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>It has been found that the longer-lived isotopes of polonium can be formed by proton bombardment of bismuth using a cyclotron. Other more neutron-rich isotopes can be formed by the irradiation of platinum with carbon nuclei.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Polonium-based sources of alpha particles were produced in the former Soviet Union. Such sources were applied for measuring the thickness of industrial coatings via attenuation of alpha radiation. Because of intense alpha radiation, a one-gram sample of Po will spontaneously heat up to above 500 °C (932&nbsp;°F) generating about 140 watts of power. Therefore, Po is used as an atomic heat source to power radioisotope thermoelectric generators via thermoelectric materials. For instance, Po heat sources were used in the Lunokhod 1 (1970) and Lunokhod 2 (1973) Moon rovers to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights, as well as the Kosmos 84 and 90 satellites (1965).</p>\n<p>The alpha particles emitted by polonium can be converted to neutrons using beryllium oxide, at a rate of 93 neutrons per million alpha particles. Thus Po-BeO mixtures or alloys are used as a neutron source, for example in a neutron trigger or initiator for nuclear weapons and for inspections of oil wells. About 1500 of such sources with an individual activity of 1850 Ci have been used annually in the Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>Polonium was also part of brushes or more complex tools that eliminate static charges in photographic plates, textile mills, paper rolls, sheet plastics, and on substrates prior to the application of coatings (such as automotive). Alpha particles emitted by polonium ionize air molecules that neutralize charges on the nearby surfaces. However, polonium needs to be replaced in these devices nearly every year because of its short half-life; it is also highly radioactive and therefore has been mostly replaced by less dangerous beta particle sources.</p>\n<h2>Biological role and toxicity</h2>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Polonium is highly dangerous and has no biological role. By mass, polonium-210 is around 250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide (the actual LD for Po is less than 1 microgram for an average adult (see below) compared with about 250 milligrams for hydrogen cyanide). The main hazard is its intense radioactivity (as an alpha emitter), which makes it very difficult to handle safely. Even in microgram amounts, handling Po is extremely dangerous, requiring specialized equipment (a negative pressure alpha glove box equipped with high performance filters), adequate monitoring, and strict handling procedures to avoid any contamination. Alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested, inhaled, or absorbed, although they do not penetrate the epidermis and hence are not hazardous as long as the alpha particles remain outside of the body. Meanwhile, wearing chemically resistant and \"intact\" gloves is a mandatory precaution to avoid transcutaneous diffusion of polonium directly through the skin. Polonium delivered in concentrated nitric acid can easily diffuse through inadequate gloves (e.g., latex gloves) or the acid may damage the gloves.</p>\n<p>It has been reported that some microbes can methylate polonium by the action of methylcobalamin. This is similar to the way in which mercury, selenium and tellurium are methylated in living things to create organometallic compounds. As a result when considering the biochemistry of polonium one should consider the possibility that polonium will follow the same biochemical pathways as selenium and tellurium. Studies investigating the metabolism of polonium-210 in rats have shown that only 0.002 to 0.009% of polonium-210 ingested is excreted as volatile polonium-210.</p>\n<h3>Acute effects</h3>\n<p>The median lethal dose (LD) for acute radiation exposure is generally about 4.5 Sv. The committed effective dose equivalent Po is 0.51 µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5 µSv/Bq if inhaled. Since Po has an activity of 166 TBq per gram (4,500 Ci/g) (1&nbsp;gram produces 166×10 decays per second), a fatal 4.5 Sv (J/kg) dose can be caused by ingesting 8.8&nbsp;MBq (238 microcuries, µCi), about 50 nanograms (ng), or inhaling 1.8&nbsp;MBq (48&nbsp;µCi), about 10&nbsp;ng. One gram of Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of Po is lower than these estimates, because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a median lethal dose of Po is 0.015 GBq (0.4 mCi), or 0.089 micrograms, still an extremely small amount.</p>\n<h3>Long term (chronic) effects</h3>\n<p>In addition to the acute effects, radiation exposure (both internal and external) carries a long-term risk of death from cancer of 5–10% per Sv. The general population is exposed to small amounts of polonium as a radon daughter in indoor air; the isotopes Po and Po are thought to cause the majority of the estimated 15,000–22,000 lung cancer deaths in the US every year that have been attributed to indoor radon. Tobacco smoking causes additional exposure to polonium.</p>\n<h3>Regulatory exposure limits and handling</h3>\n<p>The maximum allowable body burden for ingested Po is only 1.1&nbsp;kBq (30&nbsp;nCi), which is equivalent to a particle massing only 6.8 picograms. The maximum permissible workplace concentration of airborne Po is about 10 Bq/m (3 × 10 µCi/cm). The target organs for polonium in humans are the spleen and liver. As the spleen (150 g) and the liver (1.3 to 3&nbsp;kg) are much smaller than the rest of the body, if the polonium is concentrated in these vital organs, it is a greater threat to life than the dose which would be suffered (on average) by the whole body if it were spread evenly throughout the body, in the same way as caesium or tritium (as TO).</p>\n<p>Po is widely used in industry, and readily available with little regulation or restriction. In the US, a tracking system run by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will be implemented in 2007 to register purchases of more than 16 curies (590&nbsp;GBq) of polonium-210 (enough to make up 5,000 lethal doses). The IAEA \"is said to be considering tighter regulations&nbsp;... There is talk that it might tighten the polonium reporting requirement by a factor of 10, to 1.6 curies (59&nbsp;GBq).\" However, as of 2013, this is still the only alpha emitting byproduct material available, as a NRC Exempt Quantity, which may be held without a radioactive material license (www.laurussystems.com).</p>\n<p>Polonium and its compounds must be handled in a glove box, which is further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly lower pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.</p>\n<h3>Well-known poisoning cases</h3>\n<p>Notably, the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian dissident, in 2006 was announced as due to Po poisoning (see Alexander Litvinenko poisoning). According to Prof. Nick Priest of Middlesex University, an environmental toxicologist and radiation expert, speaking on Sky News on December 2, Litvinenko was probably the first person ever to die of the acute α-radiation effects of Po. However, according to William Dunkerley, a senior fellow at the American University in Moscow, the London coroner has yet to rule that polonium was actually the cause of Litvinenko's death, or that he was even a victim of homicide.</p>\n<p>It has also been suggested that Irène Joliot-Curie was the first person to die from the radiation effects of polonium. She was accidentally exposed to polonium in 1946 when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench. In 1956 she died from leukemia.</p>\n<p>According to the book <i>The Bomb in the Basement</i>, several deaths in Israel during 1957–1969 were caused by Po. A leak was discovered at a Weizmann Institute laboratory in 1957. Traces of Po were found on the hands of professor Dror Sadeh, a physicist who researched radioactive materials. Medical tests indicated no harm, but the tests did not include bone marrow. Sadeh died from cancer. One of his students died of leukemia, and two colleagues died after a few years, both from cancer. The issue was investigated secretly, and there was never any formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed.</p>\n<p>Abnormally high concentrations of Po have been detected in July 2012 in clothes and personal belongings of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who died in 2004 of uncertain causes. However, the spokesman for the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, where those items were analyzed, stressed that the \"clinical symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn as to whether the Palestinian leader was poisoned or not\", and that \"the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210.\" On 27 November 2012 Arafat's body was exhumed and samples were taken for separate analysis by experts from France, Switzerland and Russia, although results have not yet been released.</p>\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\n<p>It has been suggested that chelation agents such as British Anti-Lewisite (dimercaprol) can be used to decontaminate humans. In one experiment, rats were given a fatal dose of 1.45 MBq/kg (8.7&nbsp;ng/kg) of Po; all untreated rats were dead after 44 days, but 90% of the rats treated with the chelation agent HOEtTTC remained alive after 5 months.</p>\n<h3>Detection in biological specimens</h3>\n<p>Polonium-210 may be quantitated in biological specimens by alpha particle spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. The baseline urinary excretion of polonium-210 in healthy persons due to routine exposure to environmental sources is normally in a range of 5–15 mBq/day. Levels in excess of 30 mBq/day are suggestive of excessive exposure to the radionuclide.</p>\n<h2>Commercial products containing polonium</h2>\n<p>Some anti-static brushes contain up to 500 microcuries (20&nbsp;MBq) of Po as a source of charged particles for neutralizing static electricity. In USA, the devices with no more than 500 µCi of (sealed) Po per unit can be bought in any amount under a \"general license\", which means that a buyer need not be registered by any authorities.</p>\n<p>Tiny amounts of such radioisotopes are sometimes used in the laboratory and for teaching purposes—typically of the order of 4–40 kBq (0.1–1.0 µCi), in the form of sealed sources, with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix—are often exempt from licensing by the NRC and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous. Small amounts of Po are manufactured for sale to the public in the United States as 'needle sources' for laboratory experimentation, and are retailed by scientific supply companies. The actual polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold. This allows the alpha radiation (used in experiments such as cloud chambers) while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard. According to United Nuclear, they typically sell between four and eight sources per year.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence in humans and the biosphere</h3>\n<p>Polonium-210 is widespread in the biosphere, including in human tissues, because of its position in the uranium-238 decay chain. Natural uranium-238 in the Earth's crust decays through a series of solid radioactive intermediates including radium-226 to the radioactive gas radon-222, some of which, during its 3.6-day half-life, diffuses into the atmosphere. There it decays through several more steps to polonium-210, much of which, during its 138-day half-life, is washed back down to the Earth's surface, thus entering the biosphere, before finally decaying to stable lead-206.</p>\n<p>As early as the 1920s Lacassagne, using polonium provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a very specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations particularly in liver, kidney and testes. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for sulfur in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.</p>\n<h3>Tobacco</h3>\n<p>The presence of polonium in tobacco smoke has been known since the early 1960s. Some of the world's biggest tobacco firms researched ways to remove the substance—to no avail—over a 40-year period but never published the results.</p>\n<p>Radioactive polonium-210 contained in phosphate fertilizers is absorbed by the roots of plants (such as tobacco) and stored in its tissues. Tobacco plants fertilized by rock phosphates contain polonium-210, which emits alpha radiation estimated to cause about 11,700 lung cancer deaths annually worldwide.</p>\n<h3>Food</h3>\n<p>Polonium is also found in the food chain, especially in seafood.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Decay chain</li>\n<li>Polonium halo</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ \"Characterizing the Elements\".

  "title": "Astatine",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Astatine</b> is a radioactive chemical element with the chemical symbol <b>At</b> and atomic number 85. It occurs on Earth only as the result of the radioactive decay of certain heavier elements. All of its isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. Accordingly, much less is known about astatine than most other elements. The observed properties are consistent with it being a heavier analog of iodine; many other properties have been estimated based on this resemblance.</p>\n<p>Elemental astatine has never been viewed, because a mass large enough to be seen (by the naked human eye) would be immediately vaporized by the heat generated by its own radioactivity. Astatine may be dark, or it may have a metallic appearance and be a semiconductor, or it may even be a metal. It is likely to have a much higher melting point than does iodine, on par with those of bismuth and polonium. Chemically, astatine behaves more or less as a halogen (the group including chlorine and fluorine), being expected to form ionic astatides with alkali or alkaline earth metals; it is known to form covalent compounds with nonmetals, including other halogens. It does, however, also have a notable cationic chemistry that distinguishes it from the lighter halogens. The second longest-lived isotope of astatine, astatine-211, is the only one currently having any commercial application, being employed in medicine to diagnose and treat some diseases via its emission of alpha particles (helium-4 nuclei). Only extremely small quantities are used, however, due to its intense radioactivity.</p>\n<p>The element was first produced by Dale R. Corson, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, and Emilio Segrè at the University of California, Berkeley in 1940. They named the element \"astatine\", a name coming from the great instability of the synthesized matter (the source Greek word αστατος (<i>astatos</i>) means \"unstable\"). Three years later it was found in nature, although it is the least abundant element in the Earth's crust among the non-transuranic elements, with a total existing amount of much less than one gram at any given time. Six astatine isotopes, with mass numbers of 214 to 219, are present in nature as the products of various decay routes of heavier elements, but neither the most stable isotope of astatine (with mass number 210) nor astatine-211 (which is used in medicine) is produced naturally.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Astatine is an extremely radioactive element; all its isotopes have half-lives of less than 12 hours, decaying into bismuth, polonium, radon, or other astatine isotopes. Among the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only francium is less stable.</p>\n<p>The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any great degree of certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine would be immediately and completely vaporized due to the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid. However, metal formation for condensed-phase astatine has also been suggested.</p>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<p>Most of the physical properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using various theoretically-grounded or empirically-derived methods. As an example, heavier halogens are darker than are halogens of lesser atomic weight&nbsp;– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is bright green, bromine is brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as being a black solid (assuming that it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis, the melting and boiling points are estimated to be 575 K (302&nbsp;°C; 575&nbsp;°F) and 610 K (337&nbsp;°C; 638&nbsp;°F), respectively. However, some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend. Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower vapor pressure. Even so, half of a given amount of astatine will vaporize in an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature.</p>\n<p>The crystalline structure of solid astatine is unknown. Evidence for (or against) the existence of diatomic astatine (At) is sparse and inconclusive. Some sources state that At does not exist, or at least has never been observed, while other sources assert or imply its existence. Despite this controversy, many properties of diatomic astatine have been predicted; for example, its density would be 6.2–6.5 g/cm.</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<p>Many chemical properties of astatine have been determined using tracer studies on extremely dilute astatine solutions. Most known properties&nbsp;– such as anion formation&nbsp;– are in line with other halogens. However, astatine has a few metallic characteristics as well, such as plating out on a cathode, coprecipitating with metal sulfides in hydrochloric acid, and forming a cation in strong acidic solutions.</p>\n<p>Astatine has an electronegativity of 2.2 on the revised Pauling scale. This is lower than that of iodine (2.66) and the same as that of hydrogen. However, in hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride because the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred-Rochow scale (1.9) is less than that of hydrogen (2.2).</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<p>Astatine is the least reactive of the halogens, being less reactive than iodine; however, multiple compounds of astatine have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their inevitable radioactive disintegration. The reactions involved are normally tested with dilute solutions of astatine mixed with larger amounts of iodine. The iodine acts as a carrier, ensuring that there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques (such as filtration and precipitation) to work.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nHydrogen astatide space-filling model</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The formation of an astatine compound with hydrogen&nbsp;– usually referred to as hydrogen astatide&nbsp;– was noted by the pioneers of astatine chemistry. As mentioned earlier, there are grounds for referring to this compound as astatine hydride instead&nbsp;– astatine is easily oxidized, acidification by (dilute) nitric acid gives the At or At forms, and the addition of silver(I) then precipitates astatine, only partially as silver(I) astatide (AgAt) (or not at all). Iodine, in contrast, is not oxidized, and precipitates readily as silver(I) iodide.</p>\n<p>Only a few metal astatides have been reported, including those of sodium, palladium, silver, and lead. Some characteristic properties of silver astatide, and the known and hypothetical alkali and alkaline earth astatides, have been estimated by extrapolation from other silver or alkali or alkaline earth halides.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nStructure of astatine monoiodide, one of the astatine interhalogens and the heaviest known diatomic interhalogen.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Astatine is known to react with its lighter homologues iodine, bromine, and chlorine in the vapor state; these reactions produce diatomic interhalogen compounds with formulas AtI, AtBr, and AtCl. The first two compounds may also be produced in water&nbsp;– astatine reacts with iodine/iodide solution to form AtI, whereas AtBr requires (aside from astatine) an iodine/iodine monobromide/bromide solution. The excess of iodides or bromides may lead to AtBr−\n2 and AtI−\n2 ions, or in a chloride solution, they may produce species like AtCl−\n2 or AtBrCl− via equilibrium-balanced reactions with the chlorides. Oxidation of the element with dichromate (in nitric acid solution) showed that adding chloride turned the astatine into a molecule likely to be either AtCl or AtOCl. Similarly, AtOCl−\n2 or AtCl−\n2 may be produced. In a plasma ion source mass spectrometer, the similar ions [AtI], [AtBr], and [AtCl] have been formed by introducing lighter halogen vapors into a helium-filled cell containing astatine, supporting the existence of stable neutral molecules in the plasma ion state. No astatine fluorides have been discovered as yet. Their absence has been speculatively attributed to the extreme reactivity of such compounds, including the reaction of an initially-formed fluoride with the walls of the glass container to form a non-volatile product. Thus, although the synthesis of an astatine fluoride is thought to be possible, it may require a liquid halogen fluoride solvent, as has already been used for the characterization of radon fluorides.</p>\n<p>With oxygen, there is evidence for the existence of the species AtO, AtO−\n2 and AtO in aqueous solution, formed by the reaction of astatine with an oxidant such as elemental bromine or (in the last case) by sodium persulfate in a solution of perchloric acid. The well characterized AtO−\n3 anion can be obtained by, for example, the oxidation of astatine with potassium hypochlorite in a solution of potassium hydroxide. Further oxidation, such as by xenon difluoride (in a hot alkaline solution) or periodate (in a neutral or alkaline solution), yields the perastatate ion AtO−\n4; however, this is only stable in neutral or alkaline solutions. Astatine is also thought to be capable of forming cationic salts with oxyanions such as iodate or dichromate; this is based on the observation that, in acidic solutions, monovalent or intermediate positive states of astatine coprecipitate with the insoluble salts of metal cations such as silver(I) iodate or thallium(I) dichromate.</p>\n<p>Astatine may form bonds to the other chalcogens; these include SAt and At(CSN)−\n2 with sulfur, a coordination selenourea compound with selenium, and an astatine–tellurium colloid with tellurium. Additionally, astatine is known to bind to nitrogen, lead, and boron under the proper conditions.</p>\n<p>Carbon tetraastatide (CAt) is known. Astatine can replace a hydrogen atom in benzene to form CHAt; this may be oxidized to CHAtCl by chlorine. By treating this compound with an alkaline solution of hypochlorite, CHAtO can be produced.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMendeleev's table of 1871, with an empty space at the eka-iodine position</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 1869, when Dmitri Mendeleev published his periodic table, the space under iodine was empty; after Niels Bohr established the physical basis of the classification of chemical elements, it was suggested that the fifth halogen belonged there. Before its officially recognized discovery, it was called \"eka-iodine\" (from Sanskrit <i>eka</i>&nbsp;– \"one\") to imply it was one space under iodine (in the same manner as eka-silicon, eka-boron, and others). Scientists tried to find it in nature; given its rarity, these attempts resulted in a number of false discoveries.</p>\n<p>The first claimed discovery of eka-iodine was made by Fred Allison and his associates at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University) in 1931. The discoverers named element 85 \"alabamine\", and assigned it the symbol Ab, designations that were used for a few years afterward. In 1934, however, H. G. MacPherson of University of California, Berkeley disproved Allison's method and the validity of his discovery. This erroneous discovery was followed by another claim in 1937, by the chemist Rajendralal De. Working in Dacca in British India (now Dhaka in Bangladesh), he chose the name \"dakin\" for element 85, which he claimed to have isolated as the thorium series equivalent of Radium F (polonium-210) in the radium series. The properties he reported for dakin do not correspond to those of astatine, and the true identity of dakin is not known.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEmilio Segrè, one of the discoverers of astatine</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 1940, the Swiss chemist Walter Minder announced the discovery of element 85 as the beta decay product of Radium A (polonium-218), choosing the name \"helvetium\" (from Helvetia, \"Switzerland\"). However, Berta Karlik and Traude Bernert were unsuccessful in reproducing his experiments, and subsequently attributed Minder's results to contamination of his radon stream (radon-222 is the parent isotope of polonium-218). In 1942, Minder, in collaboration with the English scientist Alice Leigh-Smith, announced the discovery of another isotope of element 85, presumed to be the product of Thorium A (polonium-216) beta decay. They named this substance \"anglo-helvetium\", but Karlik and Bernert were again unable to reproduce these results.</p>\n<p>In 1940, Dale R. Corson, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, and Emilio Segrè finally isolated the element at the University of California, Berkeley. Instead of searching for the element in nature, the scientists created it by bombarding bismuth-209 with alpha particles. The name \"astatine\" comes from the Greek word αστατος (<i>astatos</i>, meaning \"unstable\"), due to its propensity for radioactive decay (later, all isotopes of the element were shown to be unstable), together with the ending \"-ine\", found in the names of the four previously discovered halogens. Three years later, astatine was found as a product of naturally occurring decay chains by Karlik and Bernert. Since then, astatine has been determined to be in three out of the four natural decay chains.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of astatine</div>\n<p>There are 32 known isotopes of astatine, with atomic masses (mass numbers) of 191 and 193–223. No stable or even long-lived astatine isotope is known, and no such isotope is expected to exist.</p>\n<div>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>Astatine has 23 nuclear isomers, which are nuclei with one or more nucleons (protons or neutrons) in an excited state. A nuclear isomer may also be called a \"meta-state\", meaning the system has more internal energy than the \"ground state\" (the state with the lowest possible internal energy), making the former likely to decay into the latter. There may be more than one isomer for each isotope. The most stable of these nuclear isomers is astatine-202m1, which has a half-life of about 3 minutes, longer than those of all the ground states except for those of isotopes 203–211 and 220. The least stable one is astatine-214m1; its half-life of 265 nanoseconds is shorter than those of all ground states except that of astatine-213.</p>\n<p>Astatine's alpha decay energies follow the same trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter astatine isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211, however, has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, because it has a nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1&nbsp;hours for astatine-210 and 7.2&nbsp;hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the highest amount of energy of all astatine isotopes. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, due to the increasing role of beta decay (electron emission). This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that the element has no beta-stable isotopes (i.e., ones that do not beta decay at all). Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, astatine-214, astatine-215, and astatine-216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay (positron emission), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes electron capture instead.</p>\n<p>The most stable isotope is astatine-210, which has a half-life of 8.1&nbsp;hours. This isotope's primary decay mode is beta plus decay to the relatively long-lived (in comparison to astatine isotopes) alpha emitter polonium-210. In total, only five isotopes have half-lives exceeding one hour (those with mass numbers between 207 and 211). The least stable ground state isotope is astatine-213, with a half-life of 125 nanoseconds. It alpha decays to the extremely long-lived (in practice, stable) bismuth-209.</p>\n<h2>Natural occurrence</h2>\n<p>Astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element that is not a transuranic element, with the total amount in Earth's crust estimated to be less than 28 grams (1&nbsp;oz) at any given time. Any astatine that was present at the Earth's formation has long since decayed, and the minute amounts of astatine existing currently have formed through the decay of heavier elements. While it was previously thought to be the rarest element occurring on the Earth, astatine has lost this status to berkelium, atoms of which can be produced by neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly concentrated uranium-bearing deposits.</p>\n<p>Six astatine isotopes occur naturally (astatine-214 to astatine-219). Because of their short half-lives, they are found only in trace amounts. There is no data indicating that astatine occurs in stars.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNeptunium series, showing the decay products, including astatine-217, formed from neptunium-237</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Four out of these isotopes (astatine-215, astatine-217, astatine-218, and astatine-219) are found due to their production in major natural decay chains. Francium-223, the father isotope of astatine-219, alpha decays with a probability of only 0.006%, making this astatine isotope extremely rare even compared to the other astatine isotopes; this is in spite of its half-life being the longest of the natural astatine isotopes (56 seconds). Astatine-219 decays to polonium-215, which itself beta decays to astatine-215 with an even smaller probability of 0.00023%. The entirety of North and South America combined, considered to a depth of 16 kilometers (10 miles), contain only about one trillion astatine-215 atoms at any given time. Astatine-218 is found in nature as a result of polonium-218 beta decay; as with francium-223 and polonium-215, decay to an astatine isotope is not the primary decay mode. However, the astatine-217 isotope has a straight chain leading directly to astatine; its father isotope (francium-221) decays exclusively to this nuclide. Given that its fathers, grandfathers, and so on each decay exclusively to only one nuclide, this gives only one possible way for the starting nuclide in the neptunium series (neptunium-237) to decay&nbsp;– via eventual production of astatine-217.</p>\n<p>The isotopes with mass numbers 214 through 216 are found as the result of triple alpha decay of the naturally present protactinium isotopes protactinium-226, protactinium-227, and protactinium-228. However, these isotopes are extremely rare, so much so that they are often not cited as natural astatine isotopes.</p>\n<h2>Synthesis</h2>\n<h3>Formation</h3>\n<div>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>Astatine was first produced by bombarding bismuth-209 with energetic alpha particles, and this is still the major route used to create the relatively long-lived isotopes astatine-209 through astatine-211. Astatine is only produced in microscopic quantities, with modern techniques allowing production runs of 2&nbsp;terabecquerels (about 25&nbsp;micrograms).</p>\n<p>The most important isotope is astatine-211, the only one to currently have a commercial use. To produce the bismuth target, the metal is sputtered onto a gold, copper, or aluminum surface at 50 to 100 milligrams per square centimeter. The bismuth layer, or alternatively bismuth oxide, is forcibly fused with a copper plate. The target is kept under a chemically neutral nitrogen atmosphere, and is cooled with water to prevent premature astatine vaporization. In a particle accelerator, such as a cyclotron, alpha particles (helium-4 nuclei) are collided with the bismuth. Even though there is only one bismuth isotope used (bismuth-209), the reaction may occur in three possible ways, producing astatine-209, astatine-210, or astatine-211. In order to eliminate undesired nuclides, the maximum energy of the particle accelerator is set to any value (such as 30&nbsp;MeV) above that for the reaction producing astatine-211 (to produce the desired isotope) and below the one producing astatine-210 (to avoid producing other astatine isotopes).</p>\n<h3>Separation</h3>\n<p>Since the element is the main product of the synthesis, after its formation it must only be separated from the target and traces of other radioisotopes. The astatine-containing target is heated to 270&nbsp;°C (520&nbsp;°F) to vaporize away volatile traces of radioisotopes, after which the temperature is raised to 800&nbsp;°C (1450&nbsp;°F). Although 80% of astatine may vaporize at this temperature, bismuth begins to vaporize as well. Astatine's vaporization does not occur at an adequate rate at temperatures below 600&nbsp;°C (1100&nbsp;°F), but at temperatures above 800&nbsp;°C (1450&nbsp;°F), astatine's volatility from a bismuth surface increases significantly. The condensed vapor (distillate) is collected on a water-cooled platinum surface, which is later moved into a U-like quartz vessel. The quartz container vessel is heated to 130&nbsp;°C (270&nbsp;°F) to remove further traces of impurities (typically polonium) and then to 500&nbsp;°C (930&nbsp;°F) to remove astatine, which is collected on a cold finger. The purified element is then washed off the cold finger with a weak nitric acid solution. Using this technique, yields of astatine of up to 30% may be achieved.</p>\n<h2>Uses and precautions</h2>\n<div>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>The newly formed astatine-211 is important in nuclear medicine. Once produced, astatine must be used quickly, as it decays with a half-life of 7.2&nbsp;hours; this is, however, long enough to permit multi-step labeling strategies. Astatine-211 can be used for targeted alpha particle radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide of polonium-211, which itself undergoes further alpha decay).</p>\n<p>In a manner similar to iodine, astatine is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland, although to a lesser extent. However, it tends to concentrate in the liver in the form of a radiocolloid if it is released into the systemic circulation. The principal medicinal difference between astatine-211 and iodine-131 (a radioactive iodine isotope also used in medicine) is that astatine does not emit high energy beta particles (electrons), as does iodine-131. Beta particles have considerably greater penetrating power through tissues than do the much heavier alpha particles. While an average energy alpha particle released by decay of astatine-211 can travel up to 70&nbsp;µm through the surrounding tissues, an average energy beta particle emitted by iodine-131 can travel nearly 30 times as far, to about 2&nbsp;mm. Thus, using astatine-211 instead of iodine-131 enables the thyroid to be dosed appropriately, while the neighboring parathyroid gland is spared. The short half-life and limited penetrating power of its radiation through tissues renders astatine generally preferable to iodine-131 when used in diagnosis as well.</p>\n<p>Experiments in rats and monkeys, however, suggest that astatine causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. These experiments also suggest that astatine could cause damage to the thyroid of any organism. Early research suggested that injection of lethal quantities of astatine caused morphological changes in breast tissue (although not other tissues); however, this conclusion currently remains controversial.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ However, this half-vaporization period grows dramatically, to 16 hours, if it is instead put on a gold or a platinum surface; this may be caused by poorly understood interactions between astatine and these noble metals.</li>\n<li>^ It is also possible that this is, instead, actually sorption on a cathode.</li>\n<li>^ The algorithm used to generate the Allred-Rochow scale fails in the case of hydrogen, providing a value that is close to that of oxygen (3.5). Hydrogen is instead assigned a value of 2.2. Despite this shortcoming, the Allred-Rochow scale has achieved a relatively high degree of acceptance.</li>\n<li>^ Iodine can act as a carrier despite it reacting with astatine in water because these reactions require iodide (I), not (only) I.</li>\n<li>^ An initial attempt to fluoridate astatine using chlorine trifluoride resulted in formation of a product which got stuck to the glass. Notably, chlorine molofluoride, chlorine, and tetrafluorosilane were formed. The authors called the effect \"puzzling\", admitting they had expected formation of a volatile fluoride. Ten years later, the compound was predicted to have a non-volatile appearance, out of line with the other halogens but similarly to radon fluoride; by the time, the latter had been shown to be ionic.</li>\n<li>^ In other words, some other substance was undergoing beta decay (to a different end element), not polonium-218.</li>\n<li>^ In the table, under the words \"mass excess\", the energy equivalents are given rather than the real mass excesses; \"mass excess daughter\" stands for the energy equivalent of the mass excess sum of the daughter of the isotope and the alpha particle; \"alpha half-life\" refers to the half-life if decay modes other than alpha are omitted.</li>\n<li>^ Since astatine-221 has not been shown to undergo alpha decay, the alpha decay energy is theoretical. Also note that the nuclide's mass excess was not measured, but calculated from theory instead.</li>\n<li>^ \"m1\" means that this state of the isotope is the next possible one above&nbsp;– with an energy greater than&nbsp;– the ground state. \"m2\" and similar designations refer to further higher energy states. The number may be dropped if there is only one well-established meta state, such as astatine-216m. Note that other designation techniques are sometimes used.</li>\n<li>^ This means that, if decay modes other than alpha are omitted, then astatine-210 has an alpha half-life of 4,628.6&nbsp;hours (128.9&nbsp;days) and astatine-211 has one of only 17.2 hours (0.7&nbsp;days). Therefore, astatine-211 is very much less stable toward alpha decay than the previous isotope.</li>\n<li>^ Astatine is thought to react with bismuth at lower temperatures to form non-volatile compounds, which prevent the astatine from vaporizing, but these compounds are believed to decompose at 700–800&nbsp;°C (1275–1450&nbsp;°F).</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   Bonchev, Danail; Kamenska, Verginia (1981). \"Predicting the properties of the 113–120 transactinide elements\".

  "title": "Radon",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Radon (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Radon</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Rn</b> and atomic number&nbsp;86. It is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, occurring naturally as an indirect decay product of uranium or thorium. Its most stable isotope, Rn, has a half-life of 3.8 days. Radon is one of the densest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions. It is also the only gas under normal conditions that only has radioactive isotopes, and is considered a health hazard due to its radioactivity. Intense radioactivity has also hindered chemical studies of radon and only a few compounds are known.</p>\n<p>Radon is formed as one intermediate step in the normal radioactive decay chains, through which thorium and uranium slowly decay into lead. Thorium and uranium are the two most common radioactive elements on earth; they have been around since the earth was formed. Their naturally occurring isotopes have very long half-lives, on the order of billions of years. Thorium and uranium, their decay product radium, and its decay product radon, will therefore continue to occur for tens of millions of years at almost the same concentrations as they do now. As radon itself decays, it produces new radioactive elements called radon daughters or decay products. Unlike the gaseous radon itself, radon daughters are solids and stick to surfaces, such as dust particles in the air. If such contaminated dust is inhaled, these particles can stick to the airways of the lung and increase the risk of developing lung cancer.</p>\n<p>Unlike all the other intermediate elements in the aforementioned decay chains, radon is gaseous and so easily inhaled. Thus, even in this age of nuclear reactors, naturally-occurring radon is responsible for the majority of the public exposure to ionizing radiation. It is often the single largest contributor to an individual's background radiation dose, and is the most variable from location to location. Despite its short lifetime, some radon gas from natural sources can accumulate to far higher than normal concentrations in buildings, especially in confined areas such as attics and basements. It can also be found in some spring waters and hot springs.</p>\n<p>Epidemiological studies have shown a clear link between breathing high concentrations of radon and incidence of lung cancer. Thus, radon is considered a significant contaminant that affects indoor air quality worldwide. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking, causing 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. About 2,900 of these deaths occur among people who have never smoked. While radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, it is the number one cause among non-smokers, according to EPA estimates.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEmission spectrum of radon, photographed by Ernest Rutherford in 1908. Numbers at the side of the spectrum are wavelengths. The middle spectrum is of radon, while the outer two are of helium (added to calibrate the wavelengths).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Radon is a colorless and odorless gas, and therefore not detectable by human senses alone. At standard temperature and pressure, radon forms a monatomic gas with a density of 9.73&nbsp;kg/m, about 8 times the density of the Earth's atmosphere at sea level, 1.217&nbsp;kg/m. Radon is one of the densest gases at room temperature and is the densest of the noble gases. Although colorless at standard temperature and pressure, when cooled below its freezing point of 202 K (−71&nbsp;°C; −96&nbsp;°F), radon emits a brilliant radioluminescence that turns from yellow to orange-red as the temperature lowers. Upon condensation, radon glows because of the intense radiation it produces.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Being a noble gas, radon is chemically not very reactive. However, the 3.8 day half-life of radon-222 makes it useful in physical sciences as a natural tracer.</p>\n<p>Radon is a member of the zero-valence elements that are called noble gases. It is inert to most common chemical reactions, such as combustion, because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. 1037&nbsp;kJ/mol is required to extract one electron from its shells (also known as the first ionization energy). However, in accordance with periodic trends, radon has a lower electronegativity than the element one period before it, xenon, and is therefore more reactive. Radon is sparingly soluble in water, but more soluble than lighter noble gases. Radon is appreciably more soluble in organic liquids than in water. Early studies concluded that the stability of radon hydrate should be of the same order as that of the hydrates of chlorine (Cl\n2) or sulfur dioxide (SO\n2), and significantly higher than the stability of the hydrate of hydrogen sulfide (H\n2S).</p>\n<p>Because of its cost and radioactivity, experimental chemical research is seldom performed with radon, and as a result there are very few reported compounds of radon, all either fluorides or oxides. Radon can be oxidized by a few powerful oxidizing agents such as fluorine, thus forming radon difluoride. It decomposes back to elements at a temperature of above 250&nbsp;°C. It has a low volatility and was thought to be RnF\n2. But because of the short half-life of radon and the radioactivity of its compounds, it has not been possible to study the compound in any detail. Theoretical studies on this molecule predict that it should have a Rn-F bond distance of 2.08&nbsp;Å, and that the compound is thermodynamically more stable and less volatile than its lighter counterpart XeF\n2. The octahedral molecule RnF\n6 was predicted to have an even lower enthalpy of formation than the difluoride. The higher fluorides RnF and RnF have been claimed to exist, but it is doubtful whether they have actually been synthesized. The [RnF] ion is believed to form by the reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Rn (g) + 2 [O\n2]+[SbF\n6]− (s) → [RnF]+[Sb\n2F\n11]− (s) + 2 O\n2 (g)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Radon oxides are among the few other reported compounds of radon; only the trioxide has been confirmed. Radon carbonyl RnCO has been predicted to be stable and to have a linear molecular geometry. The molecules Rn\n2 and RnXe were found to be significantly stabilized by spin-orbit coupling. Radon caged inside a fullerene has been proposed as a drug for tumors.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of radon</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe radium or uranium series.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Radon has no stable isotopes. However, 36 radioactive isotopes have been characterized, with their atomic masses ranging from 193 to 228. The most stable isotope is Rn, which is a decay product of Ra, a decay product of U. Among the daughters of Rn is also the highly unstable isotope Rn.</p>\n<p>There are three other radon isotopes that have a half-life of over an hour: Rn, Rn and Rn. The Rn isotope is a natural decay product of the most stable thorium isotope (Th), and is commonly referred to as thoron. It has a half-life of 55.6 seconds and also emits alpha radiation. Similarly, Rn is derived from the most stable isotope of actinium (Ac)—named \"actinon\"—and is an alpha emitter with a half-life of 3.96 seconds. No radon isotopes occur significantly in the neptunium (Np) decay series.</p>\n<h4>Progenies</h4>\n<div>Main article: Decay chain#Radium series (also known as uranium series)</div>\n<p>Rn belongs to the radium and uranium-238 decay chain, and has a half-life of 3.8235 days. Its four first products (excluding marginal decay schemes) are very short-lived, meaning that the corresponding disintegrations are indicative of the initial radon distribution. Its decay goes through the following sequence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rn, 3.8 days, alpha decaying to...</li>\n<li>Po, 3.10 minutes, alpha decaying to...</li>\n<li>Pb, 26.8 minutes, beta decaying to...</li>\n<li>Bi, 19.9 minutes, beta decaying to...</li>\n<li>Po, 0.1643&nbsp;ms, alpha decaying to...</li>\n<li>Pb, which has a much longer half-life of 22.3 years, beta decaying to...</li>\n<li>Bi, 5.013 days, beta decaying to...</li>\n<li>Po, 138.376 days, alpha decaying to...</li>\n<li>Pb, stable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The radon equilibrium factor is the ratio between the activity of all short-period radon progenies (which are responsible for most of radon's biological effects), and the activity that would be at equilibrium with the radon parent.</p>\n<p>If a closed volume is constantly supplied with radon, the concentration of short-lived isotopes will increase until an equilibrium is reached where the rate of decay of each decay product will equal that of the radon itself. The equilibrium factor is 1 when both activities are equal, meaning that the decay products have stayed close to the radon parent long enough for the equilibrium to be reached, within a couple of hours. Under these conditions each additional pCi/L of radon will increase exposure, by 0.01&nbsp;WL (see explanation of WL below). These conditions are not always met: in many homes, the equilibrium fraction is typically 40%; that is, there will be 0.004&nbsp;WL of progeny for each pCi/L of radon in air. Pb takes much longer (decades) to come in equilibrium with radon, but, if the environment permits accumulation of dust over extended periods of time, Pb and its decay products may contribute to overall radiation levels as well.</p>\n<p>Because of their electrostatic charge, radon progenies adhere to surfaces or dust particles, whereas gaseous radon does not. Attachment removes them from the air, usually causing the equilibrium factor in the atmosphere to be less than one. The equilibrium factor is also lowered by air circulation or air filtration devices, and is increased by airborne dust particles, including cigarette smoke. In high concentrations, airborne radon isotopes contribute significantly to human health risk. The equilibrium factor found in epidemiological studies is 0.4.</p>\n<h2>History and etymology</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nApparatus used by Ramsay and Whytlaw-Gray to isolate radon. <b>M</b> is a capillary tube where approximately 0.1&nbsp;mm were isolated. Rn mixed with H\n2 entered the evacuated system through siphon <b>A</b>; mercury is shown in black.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Radon was the fifth radioactive element to be discovered, in 1900 by Friedrich Ernst Dorn, after uranium, thorium, radium and polonium. In 1900 Dorn reported some experiments in which he noticed that radium compounds emanate a radioactive gas he named <i>Radium Emanation</i> (<i>Ra Em</i>). Before that, in 1899, Pierre and Marie Curie observed that the \"gas\" emitted by radium remained radioactive for a month. Later that year, Robert B. Owens and Ernest Rutherford, at McGill University in Montreal, noticed variations when trying to measure radiation from thorium oxide. Rutherford noticed that the compounds of thorium continuously emit a radioactive gas that retains the radioactive powers for several minutes, and called this gas <i>emanation</i> (from Latin \"emanare\"—to elapse and \"emanatio\"—expiration), and later <i>Thorium Emanation</i> (<i>Th Em</i>). In 1901, he demonstrated that the emanations are radioactive, but credited the Curies for the discovery of the element. In 1903, similar emanations were observed from actinium by André-Louis Debierne and were called <i>Actinium Emanation</i> (<i>Ac Em</i>).</p>\n<p>Several names were suggested for these three gases: <i>exradio</i>, <i>exthorio</i>, and <i>exactinio</i> in 1904; <i>radon</i>, <i>thoron</i>, and <i>akton</i> in 1918; <i>radeon</i>, <i>thoreon</i>, and <i>actineon</i> in 1919, and eventually <i>radon</i>, <i>thoron</i>, and <i>actinon</i> in 1920. The likeness of the spectra of these three gases with those of argon, krypton, and xenon, and their observed chemical inertia led Sir William Ramsay to suggest in 1904 that the \"emanations\" might contain a new element of the noble gas family.</p>\n<p>In 1910, Sir William Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray isolated radon, determined its density, and determined that it was the heaviest known gas. They wrote that \"L'expression de l'émanation du radium est fort incommodé\", (the expression of radium emanation is very awkward) and suggested the new name niton (Nt) (from the Latin \"nitens\" meaning \"shining\") to emphasize the radioluminescence property, and in 1912 it was accepted by the International Commission for Atomic Weights. In 1923, the International Committee for Chemical Elements and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) chose among the names radon (Rn), thoron (Tn), and actinon (An). Later, when isotopes were numbered instead of named, the element took the name of the most stable isotope, <i>radon</i>, while Tn was renamed Rn and An was renamed Rn. As late as the 1960s, the element was also referred to simply as <i>emanation</i>. The first synthesized compound of radon, radon fluoride, was obtained in 1962.</p>\n<p>The danger of high exposure to radon in mines, where exposures reaching 1,000,000&nbsp;Bq/m can be found, has long been known. In 1530, Paracelsus described a wasting disease of miners, the <i>mala metallorum</i>, and Georg Agricola recommended ventilation in mines to avoid this mountain sickness (<i>Bergsucht</i>). In 1879, this condition was identified as lung cancer by Herting and Hesse in their investigation of miners from Schneeberg, Germany. The first major studies with radon and health occurred in the context of uranium mining in the Joachimsthal region of Bohemia. In the US, studies and mitigation only followed decades of health effects on uranium miners of the Southwestern United States employed during the early Cold War; standards were not implemented until 1971.</p>\n<p>The presence of radon in indoor air was documented as early as 1950. Beginning in the 1970s research was initiated to address sources of indoor radon, determinants of concentration, health effects, and approaches to mitigation. In the United States, the problem of indoor radon received widespread publicity and intensified investigation after a widely publicized incident in 1984. During routine monitoring at a Pennsylvania nuclear power plant, a worker was found to be contaminated with radioactivity. A high contamination of radon in his home was subsequently identified as responsible for the contamination.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>See also: Radium and radon in the environment</div>\n<h3>Concentration units</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPb is formed from the decay of Rn. Here is a typical deposition rate of Pb as observed in Japan as a function of time, due to variations in radon concentration.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>All discussions of radon concentrations in the environment refer to Rn. While the average rate of production of Rn (from the thorium decay series) is about the same as Rn, the amount of Rn in the environment is much less than that of Rn because of the short half-life of Rn (55 seconds, versus 3.8 days respectively).</p>\n<p>Radon concentration is usually measured in the atmosphere, in becquerel per cubic meter (Bq/m), the SI derived unit. Typical domestic exposures are about 100&nbsp;Bq/m indoors, and 10–20&nbsp;Bq/m outdoors.</p>\n<p>It is often measured in picocuries per liter (pCi/L) in the USA, with 1&nbsp;pCi/L=37&nbsp;Bq/m.</p>\n<p>In the mining industry, the exposition is traditionally measured in <i>working level</i> (WL), and the cumulative exposition in <i>working level month</i> (WLM): 1&nbsp;WL equals any combination of short-lived Rn progeny (Po, Pb, Bi, and Po) in 1 liter of air that releases 1.3&nbsp;×&nbsp;10&nbsp;MeV of potential alpha energy; one WL is equivalent to 2.08&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 joules per cubic meter of air (J/m). The SI unit of cumulative exposure is expressed in joule-hours per cubic meter (J·h/m). One WLM is equivalent to 3.6&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 J·h/m. An exposure to 1&nbsp;WL for 1 working month (170 hours) equals 1&nbsp;WLM cumulative exposure.</p>\n<p>A cumulative exposition of 1&nbsp;WLM is roughly equivalent to living one year in an atmosphere with a radon concentration of 230&nbsp;Bq/m.</p>\n<p>Radon (Rn), when released into the air, decays to Pb and other radioisotopes, the levels of Pb can be measured. The rate of deposition of this radioisotope is weather dependent.</p>\n<p>Radon concentrations found in natural environments are much too low to be detected by chemical means. A 1000&nbsp;Bq/m (relatively high) concentration corresponds to 0.17&nbsp;picogram per cubic meter. The average concentration of radon in the atmosphere is about 6×10 atoms of radon for each molecule in the air, or about 150 atoms in each ml of air. The radon activity of the Earth atmosphere originates from some tens of grams of radon, consistently replaced by decay of larger amounts of radium and uranium.</p>\n<h3>Natural</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRadon concentration next to a uranium mine.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Radon is produced by the radioactive decay of radium-226, which is found in uranium ores; phosphate rock; shales; igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, gneiss, and schist; and, to a lesser degree, in common rocks such as limestone. Every square mile of surface soil, to a depth of 6&nbsp;inches (2.6&nbsp;km to a depth of 15&nbsp;cm), contains approximately 1&nbsp;gram of radium, which releases radon in small amounts to the atmosphere On a global scale, it is estimated that 2,400 million curies (90 TBq) of radon are released from soil annually.</p>\n<p>Radon concentration varies widely from place to place. In the open air, it ranges from 1 to 100&nbsp;Bq/m, even less (0.1&nbsp;Bq/m) above the ocean. In caves or aerated mines, or ill-aerated houses, its concentration climbs to 20–2,000&nbsp;Bq/m. Radon concentration can be much higher in mining contexts. Ventilation regulations instruct to maintain radon concentration in uranium mines under the \"working level\", with 95th percentile levels ranging up to nearly 3&nbsp;WL (546&nbsp;pCi Rn per liter of air; 20.2&nbsp;kBq/m, measured from 1976 to 1985). The concentration in the air at the (unventilated) Gastein Healing Gallery averages 43&nbsp;kBq/m (1.2&nbsp;nCi/L) with maximal value of 160&nbsp;kBq/m (4.3 nCi/L).</p>\n<p>Radon mostly appears with the decay chain of the radium and uranium series (Rn), and marginally with the thorium series (Rn). The element emanates naturally from the ground, and some building materials, all over the world, wherever traces of uranium or thorium can be found, and particularly in regions with soils containing granite or shale, which have a higher concentration of uranium. However, not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon. Being a rare gas, it usually migrates freely through faults and fragmented soils, and may accumulate in caves or water. Owing to its very short half-life (four days for Rn), radon concentration decreases very quickly when the distance from the production area increases. Radon concentration varies greatly with season and atmospheric conditions. For instance, it has been shown to accumulate in the air if there is a meteorological inversion and little wind.</p>\n<p>High concentrations of radon can be found in some spring waters and hot springs. The towns of Boulder, Montana; Misasa; Bad Kreuznach, Germany; and the country of Japan have radium-rich springs that emit radon. To be classified as a radon mineral water, radon concentration must be above a minimum of 2&nbsp;nCi/L (74&nbsp;kBq/m). The activity of radon mineral water reaches 2,000&nbsp;kBq/m in Merano and 4,000&nbsp;kBq/m in Lurisia (Italy).</p>\n<p>Natural radon concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere are so low that radon-rich water in contact with the atmosphere will continually lose radon by volatilization. Hence, ground water has a higher concentration of Rn than surface water, because radon is continuously produced by radioactive decay of Ra present in rocks. Likewise, the saturated zone of a soil frequently has a higher radon content than the unsaturated zone because of diffusional losses to the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>In 1971, Apollo 15 passed 110&nbsp;km (68&nbsp;mi) above the Aristarchus plateau on the Moon, and detected a significant rise in alpha particles thought to be caused by the decay of Rn. The presence of Rn has been inferred later from data obtained from the Lunar Prospector alpha particle spectrometer.</p>\n<p>Radon is found in some petroleum. Because radon has a similar pressure and temperature curve to propane, and oil refineries separate petrochemicals based on their boiling points, the piping carrying freshly separated propane in oil refineries can become radioactive because of decaying radon and its products.</p>\n<p>Residues from the petroleum and natural gas industry often contain radium and its daughters. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be radium rich, while the water, oil, and gas from a well often contains radon. Radon decays to form solid radioisotopes that form coatings on the inside of pipework.</p>\n<h3>Accumulation in houses</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTypical log-normal radon distribution in dwellings.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The phenomenon of heightened radon contamination in homes was discovered by chance in 1985 after the stringent radiation testing conducted at a nuclear power plant entrance revealed that Stanley Watras, an engineer entering the plant, was contaminated by radioactive substances. Typical domestic exposures are of approximately 100&nbsp;Bq/m indoors. Depending on how houses are built and ventilated, radon may accumulate in basements and dwellings. Radon can also seep into an indoor environment through cracks in solid floors, construction joints, cracks in walls, gaps in suspended floors, gaps around service pipes, cavities inside walls, and the water supply. Radon concentrations in the same location may differ by a factor of two over a period of 1 hour. Also, the concentration in one room of a building may be significantly different than the concentration in an adjoining room.</p>\n<p>The distribution of radon concentrations tends to be asymmetrical around the average: the larger concentrations have a disproportionately greater weight. Indoor radon concentration is usually assumed to follow a lognormal distribution on a given territory. Thus, the geometric mean is generally used for estimating the \"average\" radon concentration in an area. The mean concentration ranges from less than 10&nbsp;Bq/m to over 100&nbsp;Bq/m in some European countries. Typical geometric standard deviations found in studies range between 2 and 3, meaning (given the 68-95-99.7 rule) that the radon concentration is expected to be more than a hundred times the mean concentration for 2 to 3% of the cases.</p>\n<p>The highest average radon concentrations in the United States are found in Iowa and in the Appalachian Mountain areas in southeastern Pennsylvania. Some of the highest readings ever have been recorded in the Irish town of Mallow, County Cork, prompting local fears regarding lung cancer. Iowa has the highest average radon concentrations in the United States due to significant glaciation that ground the granitic rocks from the Canadian Shield and deposited it as soils making up the rich Iowa farmland. Many cities within the state, such as Iowa City, have passed requirements for radon-resistant construction in new homes. In a few locations, uranium tailings have been used for landfills and were subsequently built on, resulting in possible increased exposure to radon.</p>\n<h3>Industrial production</h3>\n<p>Radon is obtained as a by-product of uraniferous ores processing after transferring into 1% solutions of hydrochloric or hydrobromic acids. The gas mixture extracted from the solutions contains H\n2, O\n2, He, Rn, CO\n2, H\n2O and hydrocarbons. The mixture is purified by passing it over copper at 720&nbsp;°C to remove the H\n2 and the O\n2, and then KOH and P\n2O\n5 are used to remove the acids and moisture by sorption. Radon is condensed by liquid nitrogen and purified from residue gases by sublimation.</p>\n<p>Radon commercialization is regulated, but it is available in small quantities for the calibration of Rn measurement systems, at a price of almost $6,000 per milliliter of radium solution (which only contains about 15 picograms of actual radon at a given moment). Radon is produced by a solution of radium-226 (half-life of 1600 years). Radium-226 decays by alpha-particle emission, producing radon that collects over samples of radium-226 at a rate of about 1&nbsp;mm/day per gram of radium; equilibrium is quickly achieved and radon is produced in a steady flow, with an activity equal to that of the radium (50 Bq). Gaseous Rn (half-life of about four days) escapes from the capsule through diffusion.</p>\n<h3>Concentration scale</h3>\n\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Medical</h3>\n<div>Main article: Radioactive quackery</div>\n<p>An early-20th-century form of quackery was the treatment of maladies in a radiotorium. It was a small, sealed room for patients to be exposed to radon for its \"medicinal effects\". The carcinogenic nature of radon due to its ionizing radiation became apparent later on. Radon's molecule-damaging radioactivity has been used to kill cancerous cells. It does not, however, increase the health of healthy cells. In fact, the ionizing radiation causes the formation of free radicals, which results in genetic and other cell damage, resulting in increased rates of illness, including cancer.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAn apparatus for (allegedly) dissolving radon into drinking water, in a restaurant in Japan</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Exposure to radon, a process known as radiation hormesis, has been suggested to mitigate auto-immune diseases such as arthritis. As a result, in the late 20th century and early 21st century, \"health mines\" established in Basin, Montana attracted people seeking relief from health problems such as arthritis through limited exposure to radioactive mine water and radon. However, the practice is discouraged because of the well-documented ill effects of high-doses of radiation on the body.</p>\n<p>Radioactive water baths have been applied since 1906 in Jáchymov, Czech Republic, but even before radon discovery they were used in Bad Gastein, Austria. Radium-rich springs are also used in traditional Japanese onsen in Misasa, Tottori Prefecture. Drinking therapy is applied in Bad Brambach, Germany. Inhalation therapy is carried out in Gasteiner-Heilstollen, Austria, in Świeradów-Zdrój, Czerniawa-Zdrój, Kowary, Lądek Zdrój, Poland, in Harghita Băi, Romania, and in Boulder, United States. In the United States and Europe there are several \"radon spas,\" where people sit for minutes or hours in a high-radon atmosphere in the belief that low doses of radiation will invigorate or energize them.</p>\n<p>Radon has been produced commercially for use in radiation therapy, but for the most part has been replaced by radionuclides made in accelerators and nuclear reactors. Radon has been used in implantable seeds, made of gold or glass, primarily used to treat cancers. The gold seeds were produced by filling a long tube with radon pumped from a radium source, the tube being then divided into short sections by crimping and cutting. The gold layer keeps the radon within, and filters out the alpha and beta radiations, while allowing the gamma rays to escape (which kill the diseased tissue). The activities might range from 0.05 to 5 millicuries per seed (2 to 200&nbsp;MBq). The gamma rays are produced by radon and the first short-lived elements of its decay chain (Po, Pb, Bi, Po).</p>\n<p>Radon and its first decay products being very short-lived, the seed is left in place. After 12 half-lives (43 days), radon radioactivity is at 1/2000 of its original level. At this stage, the predominant residual activity originates from the radon decay product Pb, whose half-life (22.3 years) is 2000 times that of radon (and whose activity is thus 1/2000 of radon's), and its descendants Bi and Po, totalizing 0.03% of the initial seed activity.</p>\n<p>In the early part of the 20th century in the USA, gold contaminated with Pb entered the jewelry industry. This was from gold seeds that had held Rn that had been melted down after the radon had decayed.</p>\n<h3>Scientific</h3>\n<p>Radon emanation from the soil varies with soil type and with surface uranium content, so outdoor radon concentrations can be used to track air masses to a limited degree. This fact has been put to use by some atmospheric scientists. Because of radon's rapid loss to air and comparatively rapid decay, radon is used in hydrologic research that studies the interaction between ground water and streams. Any significant concentration of radon in a stream is a good indicator that there are local inputs of ground water. Radon is also used in the dating of oil-containing soils because radon has a high affinity for oil-like substances.</p>\n<p>Radon soil-concentration has been used in an experimental way to map buried close-subsurface geological faults because concentrations are generally higher over the faults. Similarly, it has found some limited use in prospecting for geothermal gradients.</p>\n<p>Some researchers have investigated changes in groundwater radon concentrations for earthquake prediction. Radon has a half-life of approximately 3.8 days, which means that it can be found only shortly after it has been produced in the radioactive decay chain. For this reason, it has been hypothesized that increases in radon concentration is due to the generation of new cracks underground, which would allow increased ground water circulation, flushing out radon. The generation of new cracks might not unreasonably be assumed to precede major earthquakes. In the 1970s and 1980s, scientific measurements of radon emissions near faults found that earthquakes often occurred with no radon signal, and radon was often detected with no earthquake to follow. It was then dismissed by many as an unreliable indicator. However, as of 2009, it is under investigation as a possible precursor by NASA.</p>\n<p>Radon is a known pollutant emitted from geothermal power stations, though it disperses rapidly, and no radiological hazard has been demonstrated in various investigations. The trend in geothermal plants is to reinject all emissions by pumping deep underground, and this seems likely to ultimately decrease such radon hazards further.</p>\n<p>In the 1950s, radon has been used in industrial radiography.</p>\n<h2>Health risks&nbsp;— radon in air</h2>\n<div>Main article: Health effects of radon</div>\n<h3>Radon in mines</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRelative risk of lung cancer mortality by cumulative exposure to radon decay products (in WLM) from the combined data from 11 cohorts of underground hard rock miners. Though high exposures (&gt;50&nbsp;WLM) cause statistically significant excess cancers, the case of small exposures (10&nbsp;WLM) is inconclusive and appears slightly beneficial in this study.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Radon-222 (actually radon progeny) has been classified by International Agency for Research on Cancer as being carcinogenic to humans, and as a gas that can be inhaled, lung cancer is a particular concern for people exposed to high levels of radon for sustained periods of time. During the 1940s and 50s, when safety standards requiring expensive ventilation in mines were not widely implemented, radon exposure was linked to lung cancer among non-smoking miners of uranium and other hard rock materials in what is now the Czech Republic, and later among miners from the Southwestern United States.</p>\n<p>Since that time, ventilation and other measures have been used to reduce radon levels in most affected mines that continue to operate. In recent years, the average annual exposure of uranium miners has fallen to levels similar to the concentrations inhaled in some homes. This has reduced the risk of occupationally induced cancer from radon, although health issues may persist for those who are currently employed in affected mines and for those who have been employed in them in the past. As the relative risk for miners has decreased, so has the ability to detect excess risks among that population.</p>\n<p>Many researchers have highlighted a theoretical possible increased risk of leukemia of radon, but empirical support for this has not emerged.</p>\n<h3>Domestic-level exposure</h3>\n<p>Radon exposure (actually radon progeny) has been linked to lung cancer in numerous case-control studies performed in the United States, Europe and China. There are approximately 21,000 deaths per year in the USA due to radon-induced lung cancers.</p>\n<p>One of the most comprehensive radon studies performed in the United States by Dr. R. William Field and colleagues found a 50% increased lung cancer risk even at the protracted exposures at the EPA's action level of 4 pCi/L. North American and European Pooled analyses further support these findings.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA controversial epidemiological study showing decreased cancer risk vs. radon domestic exposure (5&nbsp;pCi/L ≈ 200&nbsp;Bq/m). This study lacks individual level controls for smoking and radon exposure, and therefore lacks statistical power to draw definitive conclusions. Because of this the error bars (which simply reflect the raw data variability) are probably too small. Among other expert panels, the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that these analyses \"can be rejected.\"</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Most models of residential radon exposure are based on studies of miners, and direct estimates of the risks posed to homeowners would be more desirable. Nonetheless, because of the difficulties of measuring the risk of radon relative to other contributors—namely smoking—models of their effect have often made use of them.</p>\n<p>Radon has been considered the second leading cause of lung cancer and leading environmental cause of cancer mortality by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Others have reached similar conclusions for the United Kingdom and France. Radon exposure in homes and offices may arise from certain subsurface rock formations, and also from certain building materials (e.g., some granites). The greatest risk of radon exposure arises in buildings that are airtight, insufficiently ventilated, and have foundation leaks that allow air from the soil into basements and dwelling rooms.</p>\n<h3>Action and reference level</h3>\n<p>WHO presented in 2009 a recommended reference level (the national reference level), 100 Bq/m, for radon in dwellings. The recommendation also says that where this is not possible, 300 Bq/m should be selected as the highest level. A national reference level should not be a limit, but should represent the maximum acceptable annual average radon concentration in a dwelling.</p>\n<p>The actionable concentration of radon in a home varies depending on the organization doing the recommendation, for example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency encourages that action be taken at concentrations as low as 74&nbsp;Bq/m (2&nbsp;pCi/L), and the European Union recommends action be taken when concentrations reach 400&nbsp;Bq/m (11&nbsp;pCi/L) for old houses and 200&nbsp;Bq/m (5&nbsp;pCi/L) for new ones.</p>\n<p>On 8 July 2010 the UK's Health Protection Agency issued new advice setting a \"Target Level\" of 100&nbsp;Bq/m whilst retaining an \"Action Level\" of 200&nbsp;Bq/m.</p>\n<h3>Radon and smoking</h3>\n<p>Results from epidemiological studies indicate that the risk of lung cancer increases with exposure to residential radon. However, there are always major uncertainties in these studies. A classical and well-known example of source of error is smoking. In addition, smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. In the West, tobacco smoke is estimated to cause about 90% of all lung cancers. There is a tendency for other hypothetical lung cancer risks to drown in the risk of smoking. Results from epidemiological studies must always be interpreted with caution.</p>\n<p>According to the EPA, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is significant due to synergistic effects of radon and smoking. For this population about 62 people in a total of 1,000 will die of lung cancer compared to 7 people in a total of 1,000 for people who have never smoked. It can however not be excluded that the risk of non-smokers should be primarily explained by a combination effect of radon and passive smoking (see below).</p>\n<p>Radon, like other known or suspected external risk factors for lung cancer, is a threat for smokers and former smokers. This was clearly demonstrated by the European pooling study. A commentary to the pooling study stated: \"it is not appropriate to talk simply of a risk from radon in homes. The risk is from smoking, compounded by a synergistic effect of radon for smokers. Without smoking, the effect seems to be so small as to be insignificant.\"</p>\n<p>A study of radiation from postmastectomy radiotherapy shows that the simple models previously used to assess the combined and separate risks from radiation and smoking need to be developed. This is also supported by new discussion about the calculation method, LNT, which routinely has been used.</p>\n<h3>Radon and passive smoking</h3>\n<p>An important question is if also passive smoking can cause a similar synergy effect with residential radon. This has been insufficiently studied. The basic data for the European pooling study makes it impossible to exclude that such synergy effect is an explanation for the (very limited) increase in the risk from radon that was stated for non-smokers.</p>\n<p>A study from 2001, which included 436 cases (never smokers who had lung cancer), and a control group (1649 never smokers) showed that exposure to radon increased the risk of lung cancer in never smokers. But the group that had been exposed to passive smoking at home appeared to bear the entire risk increase, while those who were not exposed to passive smoking did not show any increased risk with increasing radon level.</p>\n<p>This result needs confirmation by additional studies. Despite the startling results from 2001, new studies seem not to have been implemented.</p>\n<h2>Health risks&nbsp;— radon in potable water</h2>\n<p>The effects of radon if ingested are similarly unknown, although studies have found that its biological half-life ranges from 30–70 minutes, with 90 percent removal at 100 minutes. In 1999 National Research Council investigated the issue of radon in drinking water. The risks associated with ingestion was considered almost negligible.</p>\n<p>As well as being ingested through drinking water, radon is also released from water when temperature is increased, pressure is decreased and when water is aerated. Optimum conditions for radon release and exposure occur during showering. Water with a radon concentration of 10&nbsp;pCi/L can increase the indoor airborne radon concentration by 1 pCi/L under normal conditions of water use.</p>\n<p>Radon concentrations in air may be high in plants with large pools of groundwater, such as treatment plants for drinking water.</p>\n<h2>Testing and mitigation</h2>\n<div>Main article: Radon mitigation</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA radon test kit.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>There are relatively simple tests for radon gas. In some countries these tests are methodically done in areas of known systematic hazards. Radon detection devices are commercially available. The short-term radon test devices used for screening purposes are inexpensive, in some cases free. There are very important protocols for taking short-term radon tests and it is imperative that they be strictly followed. The kit includes a collector that the user hangs in the lowest livable floor of the house for 2 to 7 days. The user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis. Long term kits, taking collections for up to one year, are also available. An open-land test kit can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins.</p>\n<p>Radon levels fluctuate naturally, due to factors like transient weather conditions, so an initial test might not be an accurate assessment of a home's average radon level. Radon levels are at a maximum during the coolest part of the day when pressure differentials are greatest. Therefore, a high result (over 4&nbsp;pCi/L) justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement projects. Measurements between 4 and 10&nbsp;pCi/L warrant a long term radon test. Measurements over 10&nbsp;pCi/L warrant only another short term test so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed. Purchasers of real estate are advised to delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to 4&nbsp;pCi/L or less.</p>\n<p>Because the half-life of radon is only 3.8 days, removing or isolating the source will greatly reduce the hazard within a few weeks. Another method of reducing radon levels is to modify the building's ventilation. Generally, the indoor radon concentrations increase as ventilation rates decrease. In a well ventilated place, the radon concentration tends to align with outdoor values (typically 10&nbsp;Bq/m, ranging from 1 to 100&nbsp;Bq/m).</p>\n<p>Radon levels in indoor air can be lowered in a number of ways, from sub-slab depressurization to increasing the ventilation rate of the building. The four principal ways of reducing the amount of radon accumulating in a house are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sub-slab depressurization (soil suction) by increasing under-floor ventilation;</li>\n<li>Improving the ventilation of the house and avoiding the transport of radon from the basement into living rooms;</li>\n<li>Installing a radon sump system in the basement;</li>\n<li>Installing a positive pressurization or positive supply ventilation system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the EPA's \"A Citizen's Guide to Radon\", the method to reduce radon \"...primarily used is a vent pipe system and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside,\" which is also called sub-slab depressurization, active soil depressurization, or soil suction. Generally indoor radon can be mitigated by sub-slab depressurization and exhausting such radon-laden air to the outdoors, away from windows and other building openings. \"EPA generally recommends methods which prevent the entry of radon. Soil suction, for example, prevents radon from entering your home by drawing the radon from below the home and venting it through a pipe, or pipes, to the air above the home where it is quickly diluted\" and \"EPA does not recommend the use of sealing alone to reduce radon because, by itself, sealing has not been shown to lower radon levels significantly or consistently\" according to the EPA's \"Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction: How to fix your home\".</p>\n<p>Positive-pressure ventilation systems can be combined with a heat exchanger to recover energy in the process of exchanging air with the outside, and simply exhausting basement air to the outside is not necessarily a viable solution as this can actually draw radon gas <i>into</i> a dwelling. Homes built on a crawl space may benefit from a radon collector installed under a \"radon barrier\" (a sheet of plastic that covers the crawl space). For crawlspaces, the EPA states \"An effective method to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes involves covering the earth floor with a high-density plastic sheet. A vent pipe and fan are used to draw the radon from under the sheet and vent it to the outdoors. This form of soil suction is called submembrane suction, and when properly applied is the most effective way to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes.\"</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>International Radon Project</li>\n<li>Lucas cell</li>\n<li>Radiation Exposure Compensation Act</li>\n<li>Radiohalo</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   \"A Citizen's Guide to Radon | Radon | US EPA\".

  "title": "Francium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Francium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Fr</b> and atomic number&nbsp;87. It was formerly known as <b>eka-caesium</b> and <b>actinium K</b>. It is one of the two least electronegative elements, the other being caesium. Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron.</p>\n<p>Bulk francium has never been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reflective metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. However preparing such a sample is impossible, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.</p>\n<p>Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis. Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores, where the isotope francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20–30&nbsp;g (one ounce) exists at any given time throughout the Earth's crust; the other isotopes (except for francium-221) are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Francium is the most unstable of the naturally occurring elements: its most stable isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of only 22&nbsp;minutes. In contrast, astatine, the second-least stable naturally occurring element, has a half-life of 8.5&nbsp;hours. All isotopes of francium decay into either astatine, radium, or radon. Francium is also less stable than all synthetic elements up to element 105.</p>\n<p>Francium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties mostly resemble those of caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if such a substance were to be created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092&nbsp;N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was claimed to have been calculated to be around 27&nbsp;°C (80&nbsp;°F, 300&nbsp;K). However, the melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677&nbsp;°C (1250&nbsp;°F, 950&nbsp;K) is also uncertain.</p>\n<p>Linus Pauling estimated the electronegativity of francium at 0.7 on the Pauling scale, the same as caesium; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, although there are no experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium. Francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than caesium, 392.811(4)&nbsp;kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2)&nbsp;kJ/mol for caesium, as would be expected from relativistic effects, and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two.</p>\n<p>Francium coprecipitates with several caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Glendenin and Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which provides other methods of separation. Nearly all francium salts are water-soluble.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Due to its instability and rarity, there are no commercial applications for francium. It has been used for research purposes in the fields of biology and of atomic structure. Its use as a potential diagnostic aid for various cancers has also been explored, but this application has been deemed impractical.</p>\n<p>Francium's ability to be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its relatively simple atomic structure have made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>As early as 1870, chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87. It was then referred to by the provisional name <i>eka-caesium</i>. Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made.</p>\n<h3>Erroneous and incomplete discoveries</h3>\n<p>Soviet chemist D. K. Dobroserdov was the first scientist to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was actually the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40). He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element <i>russium</i> after his home country. Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odessa, and he did not pursue the element further.</p>\n<p>The following year, English chemists Gerald J. F. Druce and Frederick H. Loring analyzed X-ray photographs of manganese(II) sulfate. They observed spectral lines which they presumed to be of eka-caesium. They announced their discovery of element 87 and proposed the name <i>alkalinium</i>, as it would be the heaviest alkali metal.</p>\n<p>In 1930, Fred Allison of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute claimed to have discovered element 87 when analyzing pollucite and lepidolite using his magneto-optical machine. Allison requested that it be named <i>virginium</i> after his home state of Virginia, along with the symbols Vi and Vm. In 1934, however, H.G. MacPherson of UC Berkeley disproved the effectiveness of Allison's device and the validity of this false discovery.</p>\n<p>In 1936, Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and his French colleague Yvette Cauchois also analyzed pollucite, this time using their high-resolution X-ray apparatus. They observed several weak emission lines, which they presumed to be those of element 87. Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name <i>moldavium</i>, along with the symbol Ml, after Moldavia, the Romanian province where Hulubei was born. In 1937, Hulubei's work was criticized by American physicist F. H. Hirsh Jr., who rejected Hulubei's research methods. Hirsh was certain that eka-caesium would not be found in nature, and that Hulubei had instead observed mercury or bismuth X-ray lines. Hulubei, however, insisted that his X-ray apparatus and methods were too accurate to make such a mistake. Because of this, Jean Baptiste Perrin, Nobel Prize winner and Hulubei's mentor, endorsed moldavium as the true eka-caesium over Marguerite Perey's recently discovered francium. Perey, however, continuously criticized Hulubei's work until she was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87.</p>\n<h3>Perey's analysis</h3>\n<p>Eka-caesium was discovered in 1939 by Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, France when she purified a sample of actinium-227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220&nbsp;keV. However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80&nbsp;keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the alpha decay of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.</p>\n<p>Perey named the new isotope <i>actinium-K</i> (now referred to as francium-223) and in 1946, she proposed the name <i>catium</i> for her newly discovered element, as she believed it to be the most electropositive cation of the elements. Irène Joliot-Curie, one of Perey's supervisors, opposed the name due to its connotation of <i>cat</i> rather than <i>cation</i>. Perey then suggested <i>francium</i>, after France. This name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry in 1949, becoming the second element after gallium to be named after France. It was assigned the symbol Fa, but this abbreviation was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter. Francium was the last element discovered in nature, rather than synthesized, following rhenium in 1925. Further research into francium's structure was carried out by, among others, Sylvain Lieberman and his team at CERN in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThis sample of uraninite contains about 100,000 atoms (3.3×10&nbsp;g) of francium-223 at any given time.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Natural</h3>\n<p>Francium-223 is the result of the alpha decay of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals. In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1 × 10 uranium atoms. It is also calculated that there is at most 30&nbsp;g of francium in the Earth's crust at any time.</p>\n<h3>Synthesis</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNeutral francium atoms can be trapped in the MOT using a magnetic field and laser beams.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Francium can be synthesized in the nuclear reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Au + O → Fr + 5 n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This process, developed by Stony Brook Physics, yields francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211, which are then isolated by the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The production rate of a particular isotope depends on the energy of the oxygen beam. An O beam from the Stony Brook LINAC creates Fr in the gold target with the nuclear reaction Au + O → Fr + 5n. The production required some time to develop and understand. It was critical to operate the gold target very close to its melting point and to make sure that its surface was very clean. The nuclear reaction imbeds the francium atoms deep in the gold target, and they must be removed efficiently. The atoms diffuse fast to the surface of the gold target and are released as ions; however, this does not happen every time. The francium ions are guided by electrostatic lenses until they land into a surface of hot yttrium and become neutral again. The francium is then injected into a glass bulb. A magnetic field and laser beams cool and confine the atoms. Although the atoms remain in the trap for only about 20 seconds before escaping (or decaying), a steady stream of fresh atoms replaces those lost, keeping the number of trapped atoms roughly constant for minutes or longer. Initially, about 1000 francium atoms were trapped in the experiment. This was gradually improved and the setup is capable of trapping over 300,000 neutral atoms of francium a time. Although these are neutral \"metallic\" atoms (\"francium metal\"), they are in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Enough francium is trapped that a video camera can capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. The atoms appear as a glowing sphere about 1 millimeter in diameter. This was the very first time that anyone had ever seen francium. The researchers can now make extremely sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms, providing the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions. Francium has not, as of 2012, been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of francium</div>\n<p>There are 34 known isotopes of francium ranging in atomic mass from 199 to 232. Francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers. Francium-223 and francium-221 are the only isotopes that occur in nature, though the former is far more common.</p>\n<p>Francium-223 is the most stable isotope with a half-life of 21.8&nbsp;minutes, and it is highly unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149&nbsp;keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4&nbsp;MeV decay energy).</p>\n<p>Francium-221 has a half-life of 4.8&nbsp;minutes. It is the ninth product of the neptunium decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium-225. Francium-221 then decays into astatine-217 by alpha decay (6.457&nbsp;MeV decay energy).</p>\n<p>The least stable ground state isotope is francium-215, with a half-life of 0.12&nbsp;μs. (9.54&nbsp;MeV alpha decay to astatine-211): Its metastable isomer, francium-215m, is less stable still, with a half-life of only 3.5&nbsp;ns.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Actually the least unstable isotope, francium-223</li>\n<li>^ Some synthetic elements, like technetium and plutonium, have later been found in nature.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   Luis A.

  "title": "Radium",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Radium (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Radium</b> is a chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Ra</b> and atomic number&nbsp;88. Radium is an almost pure-white alkaline earth metal, but it readily oxidizes on exposure to air, becoming black in color. All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive, with the most stable isotope being radium-226, which has a half-life of 1601 years and decays into radon gas. Because of such instability, radium is luminescent, glowing a faint blue.</p>\n<p>Radium, in the form of radium chloride, was discovered by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie in 1898. They extracted the radium compound from uraninite and published the discovery at the French Academy of Sciences five days later. Radium was isolated in its metallic state by Marie Curie and André-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of radium chloride in 1910. Since its discovery, it has given names like radium A and radium C to several isotopes of other elements that are decay products of radium-226.</p>\n<p>In nature, radium is found in uranium ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite. Radium is not necessary for living organisms, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical characteristics</h3>\n<p>Although radium is not as well studied as its stable lighter homologue barium, the two elements have very similar properties. Their first two ionization energies are very similar: 509.3 and 979.0 kJ·mol for radium and 502.9 and 965.2 kJ·mol for barium. Such low figures yield both elements' high reactivity and the formation of the very stable Ra ion and similar Ba.</p>\n<p>Pure radium is a white, silvery, solid metal, melting at 700 °C (1292 °F) and boiling at 1737 °C (3159 °F), similar to barium. Radium has a density of 5.5 g/cm; the radium-barium density ratio is comparable to the radium-barium atomic mass ratio, as these elements have very similar body-centered cubic structures.</p>\n<h3>Chemical characteristics and compounds</h3>\n<div>See also category: Radium compounds</div>\n<p>Radium is the heaviest known alkaline earth metal; its chemical properties mostly resemble those of barium. When exposed to air, radium reacts violently with it, forming radium nitride, which causes blackening of this white metal. It exhibits only the +2 oxidation state in solution. Radium ions do not form complexes easily, due to highly basic character of the ions. Most radium compounds coprecipitate with all barium, most strontium, and most lead compounds, and are ionic salts. The radium ion is colorless, making radium salts white when freshly prepared, turning yellow and ultimately dark with age owing to self-decomposition from the alpha radiation. Compounds of radium flame red-purple and give a characteristic spectrum. Like other alkaline earth metals, radium reacts violently with water to form radium hydroxide and is slightly more volatile than barium. Because of its geologically short half-life and intense radioactivity, radium compounds are quite rare, occurring almost exclusively in uranium ores.</p>\n<p>Radium chloride, radium bromide, radium hydroxide and radium nitrate are soluble in water, with solubilities slightly lower than those of barium analogs for bromide and chloride, and higher for nitrate. Radium hydroxide is more soluble than hydroxides of other alkaline earth metals, actinium, and thorium, and more basic than barium hydroxide. It can be separated from these elements by their precipitation with ammonia. Insoluble radium compounds include radium sulfate, radium chromate, radium iodate, radium carbonate and radium tetrafluoroberyllate; the radium sulfate is the most insoluble known sulfate. Radium oxide remains uncharacterized, despite the fact that oxides are common compounds for other alkaline-earth metals.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of radium</div>\n<p>Radium has 25 different known isotopes, four of which are found in nature, with Ra being the most common. Ra, Ra, Ra and Ra are all generated naturally in the decay of either uranium (U) or thorium (Th). Ra is a product of U decay, and is the longest-lived isotope of radium with a half-life of 1601 years; next longest is Ra, a product of Th breakdown, with a half-life of 5.75 years.</p>\n<p>Radium has no stable isotopes; however, four isotopes of radium are present in decay chains,all of which are present in trace amounts. The most abundant and the longest-living one is radium-226, with a half-life of 1601 years. To date, 34 isotopes of radium have been synthesized, ranging in mass number from 202 to 234.</p>\n<p>At least 12 nuclear isomers have been reported; the most stable of them is radium-205m, with a half-life of between 130 and 230 milliseconds. All ground states of isotopes from radium-205 to radium-214, and from radium-221 to radium-234, have longer ones.</p>\n<p>Three other natural radioisotopes had received historical names in the early 20th century: radium-223 was known as <i>actinium X</i>, radium-224 as <i>thorium X</i> and radium-228 as <i>mesothorium I</i>. Radium-226 has given historical names to its decay products after the whole element, such as <i>radium A</i> for polonium-218.</p>\n<h3>Radioactivity</h3>\n<p>Radium is three million times as radioactive as the same mass of uranium. Its decay occurs in at least seven stages; the successive main products have been studied and were called radium emanation or exradio (now identified as radon), radium A (polonium), radium B (lead), radium C (bismuth), etc. Radon is a heavy gas, and the later products are solids. These products are themselves radioactive elements, each with an atomic weight a little lower than its predecessor.</p>\n<p>Radium loses about 1% of its activity in 25 years, being transformed into elements of lower atomic weight, with lead being the final product of disintegration.</p>\n<p>The SI unit of radioactivity is the becquerel (Bq), equal to one disintegration per second. The curie is a non-SI unit defined as that amount of radioactive material that has the same disintegration rate as 1&nbsp;gram of radium-226 (3.7×10 disintegrations per second, or 37 GBq).</p>\n<p>Radium metal maintains itself at a higher temperature than its surroundings because of the radiation it emits&nbsp;– alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. More specifically, the alpha particles are produced by the radium decay, whereas the beta particles and gamma rays are produced by relatively short-half-life elements further down the decay chain.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<p>All radium occurring today is produced by the decay of heavier elements, being present in decay chains. Owing to such short half-lives of its isotopes, radium is not primordial but trace. It cannot occur in large quantities due both to the fact that isotopes of radium have short half-lives and that parent nuclides have very long ones. Radium is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore uraninite and various other uranium minerals, and in even tinier quantities in thorium minerals.</p>\n<p>Radium-226 is a decay product of uranium and is therefore found in all uranium-bearing ores. (One ton of pitchblende typically yields about one seventh of a gram of radium).</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Uranium had no large scale application in the late 18th century and therefore no large uranium mines existed. In the beginning the only larger source for uranium ore was the silver mines at Joachimsthal (now Jáchymov) in the Austrian Empire. The uranium ore was only a by-product of the mining activities. After the isolation of radium by Marie and Pierre Curie from uranium ore from Joachimsthal several scientists started to isolate radium in small quantities. Later small companies purchased mine tailings from Joachimsthal mines and started isolating radium. In 1904 the Austrian government took over the ownership of the mines and stopped exporting raw ore. For some time the radium availability was low.</p>\n<p>The formation of an Austrian monopoly and the strong urge of other countries to have access to radium led to a world wide search for uranium ores. The United States took over as leading producer in the early 1910s. The Carnotite sands in Colorado provide some of the element, but richer ores are found in the Congo and the area of the Great Bear Lake and the Great Slave Lake of northwestern Canada. Radium can also be extracted from the waste from nuclear reactors. Large radium-containing uranium deposits are located in Russia, Canada (the Northwest Territories), the United States (New Mexico, Utah and Colorado, for example) and Australia. Neither of the deposits is mined for radium but the uranium content makes mining profitable.</p>\n<p>The amounts produced were always relatively small; for example, in 1918 13.6 g of radium were produced in the United States. As of 1954, the total worldwide supply of purified radium amounted to about 5 pounds (2.3&nbsp;kg).</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>For more details on this topic, see Marie Curie#New elements.</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMarie and Pierre Curie experimenting with radium, a drawing by André Castaigne</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Radium (Latin <i>radius</i>, ray) was discovered by Marie Skłodowska-Curie and her husband Pierre on December 21, 1898 in a uraninite sample. While studying the mineral, the Curies removed uranium from it and found that the remaining material was still radioactive. They then separated out a radioactive mixture consisting mostly of compounds of barium which gave a brilliant green flame color and crimson carmine spectral lines that had never been documented before. The Curies announced their discovery to the French Academy of Sciences on 26 December 1898. The naming of radium dates to about 1899, from the French word <i>radium</i>, formed in Modern Latin from <i>radius</i> (<i>ray</i>), called for its power of emitting energy in the form of rays.</p>\n<p>In 1910, radium was isolated as a pure metal by Curie and André-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of a pure radium chloride solution by using a mercury cathode and distilling in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas. The same year, E. Eoler produced radium by heating its azide, Ra(N). The Curies' new element was first industrially produced in the beginning of the 20th century by Biraco, a subsidiary company of Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) in its Olen plant in Belgium. UMHK offered to Marie Curie her first gram of radium. It gave historical names to the decay products of radium, such as radium A, B, C, etc., now known to be isotopes of other elements.</p>\n<p>On 4 February 1936, radium E (bismuth-210) became the first radioactive element to be made synthetically in the United States. Dr. John Jacob Livingood, at the radiation lab at University of California, Berkeley, was bombarding several elements with 5-MeV deuterons. He noted that irradiated bismuth emits fast electrons with a 5-day half-life, which matched the behavior of radium E.</p>\n<p>The common historical unit for radioactivity, the curie, is based on the radioactivity of Ra.</p>\n<h2>Historical applications</h2>\n<p>Some of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties. More recently discovered radioisotopes, such as 60Co and 137Cs, are replacing radium in even these limited uses because several of these isotopes are more powerful emitters, safer to handle, and available in more concentrated form.</p>\n<h3>Luminescent paint</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSelf-luminous white paint which contains radium on the face and hand of an old clock.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nRadium hands under ultraviolet light</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Radium was formerly used in self-luminous paints for watches, nuclear panels, aircraft switches, clocks, and instrument dials. A typical self-luminous watch that uses radium paint contains around 1 microgram of radium. In the mid-1920s, a lawsuit was filed against the United States Radium Corporation by five dying \"Radium Girl\" dial painters who had painted radium-based luminous paint on the dials of watches and clocks. The dial painters routinely licked their brushes to give them a fine point, thereby ingesting radium. Their exposure to radium caused serious health effects which included sores, anemia, and bone cancer. This is because radium is treated as calcium by the body, and deposited in the bones, where radioactivity degrades marrow and can mutate bone cells.</p>\n<p>During the litigation, it was determined that the company's scientists and management had taken considerable precautions to protect themselves from the effects of radiation, yet had not seen fit to protect their employees. Worse, for several years the companies had attempted to cover up the effects and avoid liability by insisting that the Radium Girls were instead suffering from syphilis. This complete disregard for employee welfare had a significant impact on the formulation of occupational disease labor law.</p>\n<p>As a result of the lawsuit, the adverse effects of radioactivity became widely known, and radium-dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear. In particular, dial painters no longer licked paint brushes to shape them (which caused some ingestion of radium salts). Radium was still used in dials as late as the 1960s, but there were no further injuries to dial painters. This highlighted that the harm to the Radium Girls could easily have been avoided.</p>\n<p>From the 1960s the use of radium paint was discontinued. In many cases luminous dials were implemented with non-radioactive fluorescent materials excited by light; such devices glow in the dark after exposure to light, but the glow fades. Where indefinite self-luminosity in darkness was required, safer radioactive promethium paint was initially used, later replaced by tritium which continues to be used today. Tritium emits beta radiation which cannot penetrate the skin, rather than the penetrating gamma radiation of radium and is regarded as safer. It has a half-life of 12 years.</p>\n<p>Clocks, watches, and instruments dating from the first half of the 20th century, often in military applications, may have been painted with radioactive luminous paint. They are usually no longer luminous; however, this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium (which has a half-life of 1600 years) but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium. The appearance of an often thick layer of green or yellowish brown paint in devices from this period suggests a radioactive hazard. The radiation dose from an intact device is relatively low and usually not an acute risk; but the paint is dangerous if released and inhaled or ingested.</p>\n<h4>Recreational use</h4>\n<div>Main article: Radioactive quackery</div>\n<p>Radium was once an additive in products such as toothpaste, hair creams, and even food items due to its supposed curative powers. Such products soon fell out of vogue and were prohibited by authorities in many countries after it was discovered they could have serious adverse health effects. (See, for instance, <i>Radithor</i> or <i>Revigator</i> types of \"Radium water\" or \"Standard Radium Solution for Drinking\".) Spas featuring radium-rich water are still occasionally touted as beneficial, such as those in Misasa, Tottori, Japan. In the U.S., nasal radium irradiation was also administered to children to prevent middle-ear problems or enlarged tonsils from the late 1940s through the early 1970s.</p>\n<h4>Medical use</h4>\n<p>Radium (usually in the form of radium chloride) was used in medicine to produce radon gas which in turn was used as a cancer treatment; for example, several of these radon sources were used in Canada in the 1920s and 1930s. The isotope 223Ra (under the trade name Alpharadin) is currently under investigation for use in medicine as a cancer treatment of bone metastasis.</p>\n<p>Howard Atwood Kelly, one of the founding physicians of Johns Hopkins Hospital, was a major pioneer in the medical use of radium to treat cancer. His first patient was his own aunt in 1904, who died shortly after surgery. Kelly was known to use excessive amounts of radium to treat various cancers and tumors. As a result, some of his patients died from high amounts of radium exposure. His method of radium application was inserting a radium capsule near the affected area then sewing the radium \"points\" directly to the tumor. This was the same method used to treat Henrietta Lacks, the host of the original HeLa cells, for cervical cancer.</p>\n<h4>Research</h4>\n<p>In 1909, the famous Rutherford experiment used radium as an alpha source to probe the atomic structure of gold. This experiment led to the Rutherford model of the atom and revolutionized the field of nuclear physics. When mixed with beryllium, it is a neutron source. This type of neutron source were for a long time the main source for neutrons in research.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Radium is highly radioactive and its decay product, radon gas, is also radioactive. Since radium is chemically similar to calcium, it has the potential to cause great harm by replacing calcium in bones. Exposure to radium can cause cancer and other disorders, because radium and its decay product radon emit alpha particles upon their decay, which kill and mutate cells. At the time of the Manhattan Project in 1944, the \"tolerance dose\" for workers was set at 0.1 microgram of ingested radium.</p>\n<p>Some of the biological effects of radium were apparent from the start. The first case of so-called \"radium-dermatitis\" was reported in 1900, only 2 years after the element's discovery. The French physicist Antoine Becquerel carried a small ampoule of radium in his waistcoat pocket for 6 hours and reported that his skin became ulcerated. Marie Curie experimented with a tiny sample that she kept in contact with her skin for 10 hours, and noted that an ulcer appeared several days later. Handling of radium has been blamed for Curie's death (at the age of 66) due to aplastic anemia. Stored radium should be ventilated to prevent accumulation of radon. Emitted energy from the decay of radium also ionizes gases, fogs photographic emulsions, and produces many other detrimental effects.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Decay chains</li>\n<li>Radium Girls</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Young, David A.

  "title": "Actinium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Actinium</b> is a radioactive chemical element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Ac</b> (not to be confused with the abbreviation for an acetyl group) and atomic number&nbsp;89, which was discovered in 1899. It was the first non-primordial radioactive element to be isolated. Polonium, radium and radon were observed before actinium, but they were not isolated until 1902. Actinium gave the name to the actinide series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table.</p>\n<p>A soft, silvery-white radioactive metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in uranium ores as the isotope Ac, which decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting beta particles. One tonne of uranium ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium. The close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of Ra in a nuclear reactor. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>André-Louis Debierne, a French chemist, announced the discovery of a new element in 1899. He separated it from pitchblende residues left by Marie and Pierre Curie after they had extracted radium. In 1899, Debierne described the substance as similar to titanium and (in 1900) as similar to thorium. Friedrich Oskar Giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902 as a substance being similar to lanthanum and called it \"emanium\" in 1904. After a comparison of the substances half-lives determined by Debierne, Hariett Brooks in 1904, and Otto Hahn and Otto Sackur in 1905, Debierne's chosen name for the new element was retained because it had seniority.</p>\n<p>Articles published in the 1970s and later suggest that Debierne's results published in 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900. This has led some authors to advocate that Giesel alone should be credited with the discovery. A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the nascent state of radiochemistry, highlights the prudence of Debierne's claims in the original papers, and notes that nobody can contend that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium. Debierne, who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89.</p>\n<p>The name actinium originates from the Ancient Greek <i>aktis, aktinos</i> (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. Its symbol Ac is also used in abbreviations of other compounds that have nothing to do with actinium, such as acetyl, acetate and sometimes acetaldehyde.</p>\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<p>Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, metallic element. Its estimated shear modulus is similar to that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties as lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.</p>\n<p>The first element of the actinides, actinium gave the group its name, much as lanthanum had done for the lanthanides. The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore it was not until 1945 that Glenn T. Seaborg proposed the most significant change to Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table, by introducing the actinides.</p>\n<p>Actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium exists in the oxidation state +3, and the Ac ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d7s electronic configuration of actinium, that is it easily donates 3 electrons assuming a stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH).</p>\n<h2>Chemical compounds</h2>\n<p>Only a limited number of actinium compounds are known including AcF, AcCl, AcBr, AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr, AcS, AcO and AcPO. Except for AcPO, they are all similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds and contain actinium in the oxidation state +3. In particular, the lattice constants of the analogous lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent.</p>\n\n<p>Here <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are lattice constants, No is space group number and <i>Z</i> is the number of formula units per unit cell. Density was not measured directly but calculated from the lattice parameters.</p>\n<h3>Oxides</h3>\n<p>Actinium oxide (AcO) can be obtained by heating the hydroxide at 500 °C or the oxalate at 1100 °C, in vacuum. It crystal lattice is isotypic with the oxides of most trivalent rare-earth metals.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<p>Actinium trifluoride can be produced either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700 °C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000 °C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800 °C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>AcF + 2 NH + HO → AcOF + 2 NHF</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Actinium trichloride is obtained by reacting actinium hydroxide or oxalate with carbon tetrachloride vapors at temperatures above 960 °C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium oxychloride can be prepared by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with ammonium hydroxide at 1000 °C. However, in contrast to the oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in hydrochloric acid with ammonia.</p>\n<p>Reaction of aluminium bromide and actinium oxide yields actinium tribromide:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>AcO + 2 AlBr → 2 AcBr + AlO</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>and treating it with ammonium hydroxide at 500 °C results in the oxybromide AcOBr.</p>\n<h3>Other compounds</h3>\n<p>Actinium hydride was obtained by reduction of actinium trichloride with potassium at 300 °C, and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding LaH hydride. The source of hydrogen in the reaction was uncertain.</p>\n<p>Mixing monosodium phosphate (NaHPO) with a solution of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO·0.5HO), and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400 °C for a few minutes results in a black actinium sulfide AcS. It may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000 °C.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of actinium</div>\n<p>Naturally occurring actinium is composed of one radioactive isotope; 227Ac. Thirty-six radioisotopes have been identified, the most stable being 227Ac with a half-life of 21.772 years, 225Ac with a half-life of 10.0 days and 226Ac with a half-life of 29.37 hours. All remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 10 hours and the majority of them have half-lives shorter than one minute. The shortest-lived known isotope of actinium is 217Ac (half-life of 69 nanoseconds) which decays through alpha decay and electron capture. Actinium also has two meta states.</p>\n<p>Purified 227Ac comes into equilibrium with its decay products at the end of 185 days. It decays according to its 21.773-year half-life emitting mostly beta (98.8%) and some alpha particles (1.2%); the successive decay products are part of the actinium series. Owing to the low available amounts, low energy of its beta particles (46 keV) and low intensity of alpha radiation, 227Ac is difficult to detect directly by its emission and it is therefore traced via its decay products. The isotopes of actinium range in atomic weight from 206&nbsp;u (206Ac) to 236&nbsp;u (236Ac).</p>\n\n<h2>Occurrence and synthesis</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUraninite ores have elevated concentrations of actinium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Actinium is found only in traces in uranium ores as Ac – one tonne of ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium. The actinium isotope Ac is a transient member of the actinium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope U (or Pu) and ends with the stable lead isotope Pb. Another actinium isotope (Ac) is transiently present in the neptunium series decay chain, beginning with Np (or U) and ending with thallium (Tl) and near-stable bismuth (Bi).</p>\n<p>The low natural concentration, and the close similarity of physical and chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved. Instead, actinium is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of Ra in a nuclear reactor.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The reaction yield is about 2% of the radium weight. Ac can further capture neutrons resulting in small amounts of Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for actinium). An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid, which can result in a separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as eluant.</p>\n<p>Ac was first produced artificially at the Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) in Germany using a cyclotron and at St George Hospital in Sydney using a linac in 2000. This rare isotope has potential applications in radiation therapy and is most efficiently produced by bombarding a radium-226 target with 20–30 MeV deuterium ions. This reaction also yields Ac which however decays with a half-life of 29 hours and thus does not contaminate Ac.</p>\n<p>Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300 °C. Higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation. Lithium was chosen among other alkali metals because its fluoride is most volatile.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium currently has no significant industrial use.</p>\n<p>Ac is highly radioactive and was therefore studied for use as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, for example in spacecraft. The oxide of Ac pressed with beryllium is also an efficient neutron source with the activity exceeding that of the standard americium-beryllium and radium-beryllium pairs. In all those applications, Ac (a beta source) is merely a progenitor which generates alpha-emitting isotopes upon its decay. Beryllium captures alpha particles and emits neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The AcBe neutron sources can be applied in a neutron probe – a standard device for measuring the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. Such probes are also used in well logging applications, in neutron radiography, tomography and other radiochemical investigations.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChemical structure of the DOTA carrier for Ac in radiation therapy.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Ac is applied in medicine to produce Bi in a reusable generator or can be used alone as an agent for radiation therapy, in particular targeted alpha therapy (TAT). This isotope has a half-life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than Bi (half-life 46 minutes). Not only Ac itself, but also its decay products emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body. The major difficulty with application of Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver for a period of tens of years. As a result, after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from Ac, the radiation from the actinium and its decay products might induce new mutations. To solve this problem, Ac was bound to a chelating agent, such as citrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones, but the excretion from the body remained slow. Much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as HEHA or DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) coupled to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor. The latter delivery combination was tested on mice and proved to be effective against leukemia, lymphoma, breast, ovarian, neuroblastoma and prostate cancers.</p>\n<p>The medium half-life of Ac (21.77 years) makes it very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters. The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed U. Its decay product, Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant. Pa decays to Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the Pa depth profile, but instead increases toward the sea bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both Pa and Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Ac is highly radioactive and experiments with it are carried out in a specially designed laboratory equipped with a glove box. When actinium trichloride is administered intravenously to rats, about 33% of actinium is deposited into the bones and 50% into the liver. Its toxicity is comparable to, but slightly lower than that of americium and plutonium.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Actinium series</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Debierne, André-Louis (1899). \"Sur un nouvelle matière radio-active\".

  "title": "Thorium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with Thallium&nbsp;or Thulium.</div>\n\n<p><b>Thorium</b> is a naturally occurring radioactive chemical element with the symbol&nbsp;<b>Th</b> and atomic number&nbsp;90. It was discovered in 1828 by the Norwegian mineralogist Morten Thrane Esmark and identified by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius and named after Thor, the Norse god of thunder.</p>\n<p>Thorium produces a radioactive gas, radon-220, as one of its decay products. Secondary decay products of thorium include radium and actinium. In nature, virtually all thorium is found as thorium-232, which undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of about 14.05 billion years. Other isotopes of thorium are short-lived intermediates in the decay chains of higher elements, and only found in trace amounts. Thorium is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in the Earth's crust, and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare earth metals.</p>\n<p>Thorium was once commonly used as the light source in gas mantles and as an alloying material, but these applications have declined due to concerns about its radioactivity. Thorium is also used as an alloying element in nonconsumable TIG welding electrodes.</p>\n<p>Canada, China, Germany, India, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States have experimented with using thorium as a substitute nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors. When compared to uranium, there is a growing interest in developing a thorium fuel cycle due to its greater safety benefits, absence of non-fertile isotopes and its higher occurrence and availability. India's three stage nuclear power programme is possibly the most well known and well funded of such efforts.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA close view of a thorium crystal</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Pure thorium is a silvery-white metal which is air-stable and retains its luster for several months. When contaminated with the oxide, thorium slowly tarnishes in air, becoming gray and finally black. The physical properties of thorium are greatly influenced by the degree of contamination with the oxide.</p>\n<p>The purest specimens often contain several tenths of a percent of the oxide. Pure thorium is soft, very ductile, and can be cold-rolled, swaged, and drawn. Thorium is dimorphic, changing at 1360&nbsp;°C from a face-centered cubic to a body-centered cubic structure; a body-centered tetragonal lattice form exists at high pressure with impurities driving the exact transition temperatures and pressures.</p>\n<p>Powdered thorium metal is often pyrophoric and requires careful handling. When heated in air, thorium metal turnings ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light. Thorium has one of the largest liquid temperature ranges of any element, with 2946&nbsp;°C between the melting point and boiling point. Thorium metal is paramagnetic with a ground state of 6d7s.</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties</h3>\n<p>Thorium is slowly attacked by water, but does not dissolve readily in most common acids, except hydrochloric acid. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride ion.</p>\n<p>Thorium's oxide is ThO. Thorium's most common oxidation state is +4, as in ThF, but thorium also has an oxidation state of +3, as in ThI. Thorium has been shown to activate carbon-hydrogen bonds, forming unusual compounds. Thorium atoms can also bond to more atoms than any other element. For instance, in the compound thorium tetrakisaminodiborane thorium bonds to fifteen hydrogen atoms.</p>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<p>Thorium compounds are stable in the +4 oxidation state.</p>\n<p>Thorium dioxide has the highest melting point (3300&nbsp;°C) of all oxides.</p>\n<p>Thorium(IV) nitrate and thorium(IV) fluoride are known in their hydrated forms: Th(NO\n3)\n4·4H\n2O and ThF\n4·4H\n2O, respectively. Thorium(IV) carbonate, Th(CO\n3)\n2, is also known.</p>\n<p>When treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid, Th forms the complex anion ThF2−\n6, which precipitates as an insoluble salt, K\n2ThF\n6.</p>\n<p>Thorium(IV) hydroxide, Th(OH)\n4, is highly insoluble in water, and is not amphoteric. The peroxide of thorium, ThO or Th(O), is rare in being an insoluble solid. This property can be used to separate thorium from other ions in solution.</p>\n<p>In the presence of phosphate anions, Th forms precipitates of various compositions, which are insoluble in water and acid solutions.</p>\n<p>Thorium monoxide has recently been produced through laser ablation of thorium in the presence of oxygen. This highly polar molecule has the largest known internal electric field.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of thorium</div>\n<p>Twenty-seven radioisotopes have been characterized, with a range in atomic weight from 210 u (Th) to 236 u (Th). The most stable isotopes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Th with a half-life of 14.05 billion years, it represents all but a trace of naturally occurring thorium.</li>\n<li>Th with a half-life of 75,380 years. Occurs as the daughter product of U decay.</li>\n<li>Th with a half-life of 7340 years. It has a nuclear isomer (or metastable state) with a remarkably low excitation energy of 7.6 eV.</li>\n<li>Th with a half-life of 1.92 years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than ten minutes.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Thorium is a component of the magnesium alloy series, called Mag-Thor, used in aircraft engines and rockets and imparting high strength and creep resistance at elevated temperatures. Thoriated magnesium was used to build the CIM-10 Bomarc missile, although concerns about radioactivity have resulted in several missiles being removed from public display.</p>\n<p>Thorium is also used in its oxide form (thoria) in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. The electrodes labeled EWTH-1 contain 1% thoria, while the EWTH-2 contain 2%. In electronic equipment, thorium coating of tungsten wire improves the electron emission of heated cathodes.</p>\n<p>Thorium is a very effective radiation shield, although it has not been used for this purpose as much as lead or depleted uranium. Uranium-thorium age dating has been used to date hominid fossils, seabeds, and mountain ranges.</p>\n<p>Environmental concerns related to radioactivity led to a sharp decrease in demand for nonnuclear uses of thorium in the 2000s.</p>\n<h3>Thorium compounds</h3>\n<p>Thorium dioxide (ThO) and thorium nitrate (Th(NO\n3)\n4) were used in mantles of portable gas lights, including natural gas lamps, oil lamps and camping lights. These mantles glow with an intense white light (unrelated to radioactivity) when heated in a gas flame, and its color could be shifted to yellow by addition of cerium.</p>\n<p>Thorium dioxide is a material for heat-resistant ceramics, e.g., for high-temperature laboratory crucibles. When added to glass, it helps increase refractive index and decrease dispersion. Such glass finds application in high-quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments. The radiation from these lenses can self-darken (yellow) them over a period of years and degrade film, but the health risks are minimal. Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colorless state with lengthy exposure to intense UV light.</p>\n<p>Thorium dioxide was used to control the grain size of tungsten metal used for spirals of electric lamps. Thoriated tungsten elements are found in the filaments of magnetron tubes. Thorium is added because of its ability to emit electrons at relatively low temperatures when heated in vacuum. Those tubes generate microwave frequencies and are applied in microwave ovens and radars.</p>\n<p>Thorium dioxide has been used as a catalyst in the conversion of ammonia to nitric acid, in petroleum cracking and in producing sulfuric acid. It is the active ingredient of Thorotrast, which was used as radiocontrast agent for X-ray diagnostics. This use has been abandoned due to its carcinogenic nature.</p>\n<p>Despite its radioactivity, thorium fluoride (ThF) is used as an antireflection material in multilayered optical coatings. It has excellent optical transparency in the range 0.35–12&nbsp;µm, and its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles, which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material. Thorium fluoride was also used in manufacturing carbon arc lamps, which provided high-intensity illumination for movie projectors and search lights.</p>\n<h3>Thorium as a nuclear fuel</h3>\n<div>See also: Thorium-based nuclear power</div>\n<h4>Benefits and challenges</h4>\n<p>The naturally occurring isotope thorium-232 is a fertile material, and with a suitable neutron source can be used as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors, including breeder reactors. In 1997, the U.S. Energy Department underwrote research into thorium fuel, and research also was begun in 1996 by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to study the use of thorium reactors. Nuclear scientist Alvin Radkowsky of Tel Aviv University in Israel founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors, which included other companies: Raytheon Nuclear Inc., Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow.</p>\n<p>Radkowsky was chief scientist in the U.S. nuclear submarine program directed by Admiral Hyman Rickover and later headed the design team which built the USA's first civilian nuclear power plant at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, which was a scaled-up version of the first naval reactor. The third Shippingport core, initiated in 1977, bred thorium. Even earlier examples of reactors using fuel with thorium exist, including the first core at the Indian Point Energy Center in 1962.</p>\n<p>Some countries, including India, are now investing in research to build thorium-based nuclear reactors. A 2005 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency discusses potential benefits along with the challenges of thorium reactors. India has also made thorium-based nuclear reactors a priority with its focus on developing fast breeder technology.</p>\n<p>Some benefits of thorium fuel when compared with uranium were summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Weapons-grade fissionable material (U) is harder to retrieve safely and clandestinely from a thorium reactor;</li>\n<li>Thorium produces 10 to 10,000 times less long-lived radioactive waste;</li>\n<li>Thorium mining produces a single pure isotope, whereas the mixture of natural uranium isotopes must be enriched to function in most common reactor designs. The same cycle could also use the fissionable U-238 component of the natural uranium, and also contained in the depleted reactor fuel;</li>\n<li>Thorium cannot sustain a nuclear chain reaction without priming, so fission stops by default in an accelerator driven reactor.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When used in a breeder-like reactor, however, unlike uranium-based light water reactors, thorium requires irradiation and reprocessing before the above-noted advantages of thorium-232 can be realized, which initially makes solid thorium fuels more expensive than uranium fuels. But experts note that \"the second thorium reactor may activate a third thorium reactor. This could continue in a chain of reactors for a millennium if we so choose.\" They add that because of thorium's abundance, it will not be exhausted in 1,000 years.</p>\n<p>The Thorium Energy Alliance (TEA), an educational advocacy organization, emphasizes that \"there is enough thorium in the United States alone to power the country at its current energy level for over 10,000 years.\"</p>\n<h4>Thorium energy fuel cycle</h4>\n<div>Main article: Thorium fuel cycle</div>\n<p>Like U, Th is not fissile itself, but it is fertile: it will absorb slow neutrons to produce, after two beta decays, U, which is fissile. The preparation of thorium fuel does not require isotopic separation, unlike the preparation of uranium fuels.</p>\n<p>The thorium fuel cycle creates U, which, if separated from the reactor's fuel, could with some difficulty be used for making nuclear weapons. This is one reason why a liquid-fuel cycle (e.g. Molten Salt Reactor or MSR) is preferred — only a limited amount of U ever exists in the reactor and its heat-transfer systems, preventing any access to weapons material; however the neutrons produced by the reactor can be absorbed by a thorium or uranium blanket and fissile U or Pu produced. Also, the U could be continuously extracted from the molten fuel as the reactor is running. Neutrons from the decay of uranium-233 can be fed back into the fuel cycle to start the cycle again.</p>\n<p>The neutron flux from spontaneous fission of U is negligible. U can thus be used easily in a simple gun-type nuclear bomb design. In 1977, a light-water reactor at the Shippingport Atomic Power Station was used to establish a Th-U fuel cycle. The reactor worked until its decommissioning in 1982. Thorium can be and has been used to power nuclear energy plants using both the modified traditional Generation III reactor design and prototype Generation IV reactor designs. The use of thorium as an alternative fuel is one innovation being explored by the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO), conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>\n<p>Unlike its use in Molten salt reactors, when using solid thorium in modified light water reactor (LWR) problems include: the undeveloped technology for fuel fabrication; in traditional, once-through LWR designs potential problems in recycling thorium due to highly radioactive Th; some weapons proliferation risk due to production of U; and the technical problems (not yet satisfactorily solved) in reprocessing. Much development work is still required before the thorium fuel cycle can be commercialized for use in LWR. The effort required has not seemed worth it while abundant uranium is available.</p>\n<h4>Commercial nuclear power station</h4>\n<p>India's Kakrapar-1 reactor is the world's first reactor which uses thorium rather than depleted uranium to achieve power flattening across the reactor core. India, which has about 25% of the world's thorium reserves, is developing a 300 MW prototype of a thorium-based Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR). The prototype is expected to be fully operational by 2013, after which five more reactors will be constructed. The reactor is a fast breeder reactor and uses a plutonium core rather than an accelerator to produce neutrons. As accelerator-based systems can operate at sub-criticality they could be developed too, but that would require more research. India currently envisages meeting 30% of its electricity demand through thorium-based reactors by 2050.</p>\n<h4>Existing thorium energy projects</h4>\n<p>The German THTR-300 was the first commercial power station powered almost entirely with thorium. India's 300&nbsp;MWe AHWR (pressurized heavy water reactor) reactor began construction in 2011. The design envisages a start up with reactor grade plutonium which will breed U-233 from Th-232. After that the input will only be thorium for the rest of the reactor's design life.</p>\n<p>The primary fuel of the HTR Project near Odessa, Texas, USA will be ceramic-coated thorium beads. The earliest date the reactor will become operational is in 2015.</p>\n<p>Best results occur with molten salt reactors (MSRs), such as ORNL's liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR), which have built-in negative-feedback reaction rates due to salt expansion and thus reactor throttling via load. This is a great safety advantage, since no emergency cooling system is needed, which is both expensive and adds thermal inefficiency. In fact, an MSR was chosen as the base design for the 1960s DoD nuclear aircraft largely because of its great safety advantages, even under aircraft maneuvering. In the basic design, an MSR generates heat at higher temperatures, continuously, and without refuelling shutdowns, so it can provide hot air to a more efficient (Brayton Cycle) turbine. An MSR run this way is about 30% better in thermal efficiency than common thermal plants, whether combustive or traditional solid-fuelled nuclear.</p>\n<p>In 2009, United States Congressman Joe Sestak unsuccessfully attempted to secure funding for research and development of a destroyer-sized reactor using thorium-based liquid fuel.</p>\n<p>CANDU reactors of Atomic Energy Canada Limited are capable of using thorium as a fuel source.</p>\n<p>At the 2011 annual conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences it was announced that \"China has initiated a research and development project in thorium molten-salt reactor technology.\"</p>\n<h4>Projects combining uranium and thorium</h4>\n<p>Fort St. Vrain Generating Station, a demo HTGR in Colorado, USA, operating from 1977 until 1992, employed enriched uranium fuel that also contained thorium. This resulted in high fuel efficiency because the thorium was converted to uranium and then fissioned.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Earth's thorium originated in the death throes of ancient stars.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Morten Thrane Esmark found a black mineral on Løvøya island, Norway and gave a sample to his father Jens Esmark, a noted mineralogist. The elder Esmark was not able to identify it and sent a sample to Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius for examination in 1828. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element, which he named thorium after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. He published his findings in 1829. Berzelius reused the name of a previous element discovery from a mineral from the Falun which later proved to be a yttrium mineral. The metal had no practical uses until Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle in 1885.</p>\n<p>Thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898, independently, by Polish-French physicist Marie Curie and German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt. Between 1900 and 1903, Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements. This observation led to the identification of half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity.</p>\n<p>The crystal bar process (or \"iodide process\") was discovered by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925 to produce high-purity metallic thorium.</p>\n<p>The name ionium was given early in the study of radioactive elements to the Th isotope produced in the decay chain of U before it was realized that ionium and thorium were chemically identical. The symbol <b>Io</b> was used for this supposed element.</p>\n<p>Thorium-232 is a primordial nuclide, having existed in its current form for over 4.5 billion years, predating the formation of the Earth; it was forged in the cores of dying stars through the r-process and scattered across the galaxy by supernovas. Its radioactive decay produces a significant amount of the Earth's internal heat.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPartial North American map of thorium concentrations from the United States Geological Survey. Maps of lunar and martian thorium have also been prepared.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMonazite, a rare earth and thorium phosphate mineral, is the primary source of the world's thorium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>See also: Category:thorium minerals</div>\n<p>Thorium is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils; it is three times more abundant than tin in the Earth's crust and is about as common as lead. Soil commonly contains an average of around 6 parts per million (ppm) of thorium. Thorium occurs in several minerals including thorite (ThSiO), thorianite (ThO + UO) and monazite. Thorianite is a rare mineral and may contain up to about 12% thorium oxide. Monazite contains 2.5% thorium, allanite has 0.1 to 2% thorium and zircon can have up to 0.4% thorium. Thorium-containing minerals occur on all continents. Thorium is several times more abundant in Earth's crust than all isotopes of uranium combined and thorium-232 is several hundred times more abundant than uranium-235.</p>\n<p>Th decays very slowly (its half-life is comparable to the age of the universe) but other thorium isotopes occur in the thorium and uranium decay chains. Most of these are short-lived and hence much more radioactive than Th, though on a mass basis they are negligible.</p>\n<h2>Thorium extraction</h2>\n<div>Main article: Monazite</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Thorium has been extracted chiefly from monazite through a complex multi-stage process. The monazite sand is dissolved in hot concentrated sulfuric acid (HSO). Thorium is extracted as an insoluble residue into an organic phase containing an amine. Next it is separated or stripped using an ion such as nitrate, chloride, hydroxide, or carbonate, returning the thorium to an aqueous phase. Finally, the thorium is precipitated and collected.</p>\n<p>Several methods are available for producing thorium metal: it can be obtained by reducing thorium oxide with calcium, by electrolysis of anhydrous thorium chloride in a fused mixture of sodium and potassium chlorides, by calcium reduction of thorium tetrachloride mixed with anhydrous zinc chloride, and by reduction of thorium tetrachloride with an alkali metal.</p>\n<h2>Reserve estimates</h2>\n<p>Present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor because of the relatively low-key exploration efforts arising out of insignificant demand. There are two sets of estimates that define world thorium reserves, one set by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the other supported by reports from the OECD and the International Atomic Energy Agency (the IAEA). Under the USGS estimate, USA, Australia, and India have particularly large reserves of thorium.</p>\n<p>Both the IAEA and OECD appear to conclude that India may possess the lion's share of world's thorium deposits. The Government of India's latest estimate, shared in the country's Parliament in August 2011, puts the recoverable reserve at 846,477 tonnes.</p>\n<p>India and Australia are believed to possess about 300,000 tonnes each; i.e. each country possessing 25% of the world's thorium reserves. In the OECD reports, however, estimates of Australia's Reasonably Assured Reserves (RAR) of thorium indicate only 19,000 tonnes and not 300,000 tonnes as indicated by USGS. The two sources vary wildly for countries such as Brazil, Turkey, and Australia, however, both reports appear to show some consistency with respect to India's thorium reserve figures, with 290,000 tonnes (USGS) and 319,000 tonnes (OECD/IAEA).</p>\n<p>The IAEA's 2005 report estimates India's reasonably assured reserves of thorium at 319,000 tonnes, but mentions recent reports of India's reserves at 650,000 tonnes.</p>\n<p>The prevailing estimate of the economically available thorium reserves comes from the U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries (1996–2010):</p>\n\n<p>Note: The OECD/NEA report notes that the estimates (that the Australian figures are based on) are subjective, due to the variability in the quality of the data, a lot of which is old and incomplete. Adding to the confusion are subjective claims made by the Australian government (in 2009, through its Geoscience department) that combine the reasonably assured reserves (RAR) estimates with \"inferred\" data (i.e. subjective guesses). This strange combined figure of RAR and \"guessed\" reserves yields a figure, published by the Australian government, of 489,000 tonnes, however, using the same criteria for Brazil or India would yield reserve figures of between 600,000 to 1,300,000 tonnes for Brazil and between 300,000 to 600,000 tonnes for India. Irrespective of isolated claims by the Australian government, the most credible third-party and multi-lateral reports, those of the OECD/IAEA and the USGS, consistently report high thorium reserves for India while not doing the same for Australia.</p>\n<p>Another estimate of reasonably assured reserves (RAR) and estimated additional reserves (EAR) of thorium comes from OECD/NEA, Nuclear Energy, \"Trends in Nuclear Fuel Cycle\", Paris, France (2001):</p>\n\n<p>The preceding reserve figures refer to the amount of thorium in high-concentration deposits inventoried so far and estimated to be extractable at current market prices; millions of times more total exist in Earth's 3 * 10 ton crust, around 120 trillion tons of thorium, and lesser but vast quantities of thorium exist at intermediate concentrations. Proved reserves are \"a poor indicator of the total future supply of a mineral resource.\"</p>\n<p>The Lemhi Pass, along the Idaho-Montana border, has one of the world's largest known high quality thorium deposits. Thorium Energy, Inc. has the mineral rights to approximately 1360 acres (5.5 sq km) of it and states that they have proven thorium oxide reserves of 600 thousand tons and probable reserves of an additional 1.8 million tons within their claim.</p>\n<p>In event of a thorium fuel cycle, Conway granite with 56 (±6) parts per million thorium could provide a major low-grade resource; a 307 sq mile (795 sq km) \"main mass\" in New Hampshire is estimated to contain over three million metric tons per 100 feet (30 m) of depth (i.e. 1&nbsp;kg thorium in eight cubic metres of rock), of which two-thirds is \"readily leachable\". Even common granite rock with 13 PPM thorium concentration (just twice the crustal average, along with 4 ppm uranium) contains potential nuclear energy equivalent to 50 times the entire rock's mass in coal, although there is no incentive to resort to such very low-grade deposits so long as much higher-grade deposits remain available and cheaper to extract. Thorium has been produced in excess of demand from the refining of rare earth elements.</p>\n<h2>Dangers and biological roles</h2>\n<p>Powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric and will often ignite spontaneously in air. Natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials, and the alpha radiation emitted cannot penetrate human skin meaning owning and handling small amounts of thorium, such as a gas mantle, is considered safe. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, however, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases. Thorium is radioactive and produces a radioactive gas, radon-220, as one of its decay products. Secondary decay products of thorium include radium and actinium. Because of this, there are concerns about the safety of thorium mantles. Some nuclear safety agencies make recommendations about their use. Production of gas mantles has led to some safety concerns during manufacture.</p>\n<p>The element has no known biological role. Humans typically consume three micrograms per day of thorium. Of this, 99.98% does not remain in the body. Out of the thorium that does remain in the body, three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton. A number of thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic. People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis. Exposure to thorium over a long time can cause cancer. It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Thorium fuel cycle</li>\n<li>Liquid fluoride thorium reactor</li>\n<li>Actinides in the environment</li>\n<li>India's three stage nuclear power programme</li>\n<li>Sylvania Electric Products explosion</li>\n<li>Thorotrast</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>General:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decay chain</li>\n<li>Energy amplifier</li>\n<li>Nuclear reactor</li>\n<li>Periodic table</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^   \"IAEA-TECDOC-1450 Thorium Fuel Cycle-Potential Benefits and Challenges\" (PDF).

  "title": "Protactinium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Protactinium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Pa</b> and atomic number 91. It is a dense, silvery-gray metal which readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and inorganic acids. It forms various chemical compounds where protactinium is usually present in the oxidation state +5, but can also assume +4 and even +2 or +3 states. The average concentrations of protactinium in the Earth's crust is typically on the order of a few parts per trillion, but may reach up to a few parts per million in some uraninite ore deposits. Because of its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of scientific research, and for this purpose, protactinium is mostly extracted from spent nuclear fuel.</p>\n<p>Protactinium was first identified in 1913 by Kasimir Fajans and Oswald Helmuth Göhring and named <i>brevium</i> because of the short half-life of the specific isotope studied, namely protactinium-234. A more stable isotope (Pa) of protactinium was discovered in 1917/18 by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner, and they chose the name proto-actinium, but then the IUPAC named it finally protactinium in 1949 and confirmed Hahn and Meitner as discoverers. The new name meant \"parent of actinium\" and reflected the fact that actinium is a product of radioactive decay of protactinium.</p>\n<p>The longest-lived and most abundant (nearly 100%) naturally occurring isotope of protactinium, protactinium-231, has a half-life of 32,760 years and is a decay product of uranium-235. Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived nuclear isomer protactinium-234m occur in the decay chain of uranium-238. Protactinium-233 results from the decay of thorium-233 as part of the chain of events used to produce uranium-233 by neutron irradiation of thorium-232. It is an undesired intermediate product in thorium-based nuclear reactors and is therefore removed from the active zone of the reactor during the breeding process. Analysis of the relative concentrations of various uranium, thorium and protactinium isotopes in water and minerals is used in radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling of various geological processes.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted the existence of an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten, and thorium below zirconium, leaving the space below tantalum empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties as tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>In 1900, William Crookes isolated protactinium as an intensely radioactive material from uranium; however, he could not characterize it as a new chemical element and thus named it uranium-X. Crookes dissolved uranium nitrate in ether, the residual aqueous phase contains most of the 234\n90Th and 234\n91Pa. His method was still used in the 1950s to isolate 234\n90Th and 234\n91Pa from uranium compounds. Protactinium was first identified in 1913, when Kasimir Fajans and Oswald Helmuth Göhring encountered the isotope Pa during their studies of the decay chains of uranium-238: 238\n92U → 234\n90Th → 234\n91Pa → 234\n92U. They named the new element <i>brevium</i> (from the Latin word, <i>brevis</i>, meaning brief or short) because of its short half-life, 6.7&nbsp;hours for 234\n91Pa. In 1917/18, two groups of scientists, Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner of Germany and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston of Great Britain, independently discovered another isotope of protactinium, Pa having much longer half-life of about 32,000&nbsp;years. Thus the name <i>brevium</i> was changed to <i>protoactinium</i> as the new element was part of the decay chain of uranium-235 before the actinium (from Greek: πρῶτος = <i>protos</i> meaning <i>first</i>, <i>before</i>). For ease of pronunciation, the name was shortened to <i>protactinium</i> by the IUPAC in 1949. The discovery of protactinium completed the last gap in the early versions of the periodic table, proposed by Mendeleev in 1869, and it brought to fame the involved scientists.</p>\n<p>Aristid von Grosse produced 2&nbsp;milligrams of PaO in 1927, and in 1934 first isolated elemental protactinium from 0.1&nbsp;milligrams of PaO. He used two different procedures: in the first one, protactinium oxide was irradiated by 35&nbsp;keV electrons in vacuum. In another method, called the van Arkel–de Boer process, the oxide was chemically converted to a halide (chloride, bromide or iodide) and then reduced in a vacuum with an electrically heated metallic filament:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 PaI → 2 Pa + 5 I</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1961, the British Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) produced 125&nbsp;grams of 99.9% pure protactinium by processing 60&nbsp;tonnes of waste material in a 12-stage process, at a cost of about 500,000&nbsp;USD. For many years, this was the world's only significant supply of protactinium, which was provided to various laboratories for scientific studies. Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US is currently providing protactinium at a cost of about 280&nbsp;USD/gram.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMendeleev's 1869 periodic table with a gap for protactinium on the bottom row of the chart, between thorium and uranium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<p>Protactinium is one of the rarest and most expensive naturally occurring elements. It is found in the form of two isotopes – Pa and Pa, with the isotope Pa occurring in two different energy states. Nearly all natural protactinium is protactinium-231. It is an alpha emitter and is formed by the decay of uranium-235, whereas the beta radiating protactinium-234 is produced as a result of uranium-238 decay. Nearly all uranium-238 (99.8%) decays first to the Pa isomer.</p>\n<p>Protactinium occurs in uraninite (pitchblende) at concentrations of about 0.3-3 parts Pa per million parts (ppm) of ore. Whereas the usual content is closer to 0.3 ppm (e.g. in Jáchymov, Czech Republic), some ores from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have about 3 ppm. Protactinium is homogeneously dispersed in most natural materials and in water, but at much lower concentrations on the order of one part per trillion, that corresponds to the radioactivity of 0.1 picocuries (pCi)/g. There is about 500 times more protactinium in sandy soil particles than in water, even the water present in the same sample of soil. Much higher ratios of 2,000 and above are measured in loam soils and clays, such as bentonite.</p>\n<h3>In nuclear reactors</h3>\n<p>Two major protactinium isotopes, Pa and Pa, are produced from thorium in nuclear reactors; both are undesirable and are usually removed, thereby adding complexity to the reactor design and operation. In particular, Th via (<i>n</i>,2<i>n</i>) reactions produces Th which quickly (half-life 25.5 hours) decays to Pa. The last isotope, while not a transuranic waste, has a long half-life of 32,760 years and is a major contributor to the long term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel.</p>\n<p>Protactinium-233 is formed upon neutron capture by Th. It further either decays to uranium-233 or captures another neutron and converts into the non-fissile uranium-234. Pa has a relatively long half-life of 27 days and high cross section for neutron capture (the so-called \"neutron poison\"). Thus instead of rapidly decaying to the useful U, a significant fraction of Pa converts to non-fissile isotopes and consumes neutrons, degrading the reactor efficiency. To avoid this, Pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium molten salt reactors, during their operation, so that it only decays to U. This is achieved using several meters tall columns of molten bismuth with lithium dissolved in it. In a simplified scenario, lithium selectively reduces protactinium salts to protactinium metal which is then extracted from the molten-salt cycle, and bismuth is merely a carrier. It is chosen because of its low melting point (271 °C), low vapor pressure, good solubility for lithium and actinides, and immiscibility with molten halides.</p>\n<h2>Preparation</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nProtactinium occurs in uraninite ores.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Before the advent of nuclear reactors, protactinium was separated for scientific experiments from uranium ores. Nowadays, it is mostly produced as an intermediate product of nuclear fission in thorium high-temperature reactors:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><small>The times are half-lives.</small></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Protactinium metal can be prepared by reduction of its fluoride with calcium fluoride, lithium or barium at a temperature of 1300–1400 °C.</p>\n<h2>Physical and chemical properties</h2>\n<p>Protactinium is an actinide which is positioned in the periodic table to the left of uranium and to the right of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of \"poor metals\". The estimated shear modulus of protactinium is similar to that of titanium. Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air. Protactinium easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, but not with alkali metals.</p>\n<p>At room temperature, protactinium crystallizes in body-centered tetragonal structure which can be regarded as distorted body-centered cubic lattice; this structure does not change upon compression up to 53 GPa. The structure changes to face-centered cubic (<i>fcc</i>) upon cooling from high temperature, at about 1200 °C. The thermal expansion coefficient of the tetragonal phase between room temperature and 700 °C is 9.9×10/°C.</p>\n<p>Protactinium is paramagnetic and no magnetic transitions are known for it at any temperature. It becomes superconductive at temperatures below 1.4 K. Protactinium tetrachloride is paramagnetic at room temperature but turns ferromagnetic upon cooling to 182 K.</p>\n<p>Protactinium exists in two major oxidation states, +4 and +5, both in solids and solutions, and the +3 and +2 states were observed in some solid phases. As the electron configuration of the neutral atom is [Rn]7s6d5f, the +5 oxidation state corresponds to the low-energy (and thus favored) 5f configuration. Both +4 and +5 states easily form hydroxides in water with the predominant ions being Pa(OH), Pa(OH)2+\n2, Pa(OH)+\n3 and Pa(OH), all colorless. Other known protactinium ions include PaCl2+\n2, PaSO2+\n4, PaF, PaF2+\n2, PaF−\n6, PaF2−\n7 and PaF3−\n8.</p>\n<h2>Chemical compounds</h2>\n\n<p>Here <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are lattice constants in picometers, No is space group number and <i>Z</i> is the number of formula units per unit cell; <i>fcc</i> stands for the face-centered cubic symmetry. Density was not measured directly but calculated from the lattice parameters.</p>\n<h3>Oxides and oxygen-containing salts</h3>\n<p>Protactinium oxides are known for the metal oxidation states +2, +4 and +5. The most stable is white pentoxide PaO, which can be produced by igniting protactinium(V) hydroxide in air at a temperature of 500 °C. Its crystal structure is cubic, and the chemical composition is often non-stoichiometric, described as PaO. Another phase of this oxide with orthorhombic symmetry has also been reported. The black dioxide PaO is obtained from the pentoxide by reducing it at 1550 °C with hydrogen. It is not readily soluble in either dilute or concentrated nitric, hydrochloric or sulfuric acids, but easily dissolves in hydrofluoric acid. The dioxide can be converted back to pentoxide by heating in oxygen-containing atmosphere to 1100 °C. The monoxide PaO has only been observed as a thin coating on protactinium metal, but not in an isolated bulk form.</p>\n<p>Protactinium forms mixed binary oxides with various metals. With alkali metals <i>A</i>, the crystals have a chemical formula APaO and perovskite structure, or APaO and distorted rock-salt structure, or APaO where oxygen atoms for a hexagonal close-packed lattice. In all these materials, protactinium ions are octahedrally coordinated. The pentoxide PaO combines with rare-earth metal oxides RO to form various nonstoichiometric mixed-oxides, also of perovskite structure.</p>\n<p>Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily convert to hydroxides and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white but can be brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400 °C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO) can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaFSO with phosphoric acid (HPO) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900 °C eliminates the reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO) into the diphosphate PaPO, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO groups form pyramids of C symmetry. Heating PaPO in air to 1400 °C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<p>Protactinium(V) fluoride forms white crystals where protactinium ions are arranged in pentagonal bipyramids and coordinated by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but the color is yellow. The coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCoordination of protactinium (solid circles) and halogen atoms (open circles) in protactinium(V) fluoride or chloride.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Protactinium(V) fluoride and protactinium(V) chloride have a polymeric structure of monoclinic symmetry. There, within one polymeric chain, all the halide atoms lie in one graphite-like plane and form planar pentagons around the protactinium ions. The coordination 7 of protactinium originates from the 5 halide atoms and two bonds to protactinium atoms belonging to the nearby chains. These compounds easily hydrolyze in water. The pentachloride melts at 300 °C and sublimates at even lower temperatures.</p>\n<p>Protactinium(V) fluoride can be prepared by reacting protactinium oxide with either bromine pentafluoride or bromine trifluoride at about 600 °C, and protactinium(IV) fluoride is obtained from the oxide and a mixture of hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride at 600 °C; a large excess of hydrogen is required to remove atmospheric oxygen leaks into the reaction.</p>\n<p>Protactinium(V) chloride is prepared by reacting protactinium oxide with carbon tetrachloride at temperature of 200–300 °C. The by-products (such as PaOCl) are removed by fractional sublimation. Reduction of protactinium(V) chloride with hydrogen at about 800 °C yields protactinium(IV) chloride – a yellow-green solid which sublimes in vacuum at 400 °C; it can also be obtained directly from protactinium dioxide by treating it with carbon tetrachloride at 400 °C.</p>\n<p>Protactinium bromides are produced by the action of aluminum bromide, hydrogen bromide, carbon tetrabromide or a mixture of hydrogen bromide and thionyl bromide on protactinium oxide. An alternative reaction is between protactinium pentachloride and hydrogen bromide or thionyl bromide. Protactinium(V) bromide has two similar monoclinic forms, one is obtained by sublimation at 400–410 °C and another by sublimation at slightly lower temperature of 390–400 °C.</p>\n<p>Protactinium iodides result from the oxides and aluminum iodide or ammonium iodide heated to 600 °C. Protactinium(III) iodide was obtained by heating protactinium(V) iodide in vacuum. As with oxides, protactinium forms mixed halides with alkali metals. Among those, most remarkable is NaPaF where protactinium ion is symmetrically surrounded by 8 F ions which form a nearly perfect cube.</p>\n<p>More complex protactinium fluorides are also known such as PaF and ternary fluorides of the types MPaF (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs or NH), MPaF (M = K, Rb, Cs or NH) and MPaF (M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs), all being white crystalline solids. The MPaF formula can be represented as a combination of MF and PaF. These compounds can be obtained by evaporating a hydrofluoric acid solution containing these both complexes. For the small alkali cations like Na, the crystal structure is tetragonal, whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations K, Rb, Cs or NH. A similar variation was observed for the MPaF fluorides, namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for CsPaF and MPaF (M = K, Rb or NH).</p>\n<h3>Other inorganic compounds</h3>\n<p>Oxyhalides and oxysulfides of protactinium are known. PaOBr has a monoclinic structure composed of double-chain units where protactinium has coordination 7 and is arranged into pentagonal bipyramids. The chains are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms, and each oxygen atom is related to three Pa atoms. PaOS is a light-yellow non-volatile solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural to that of other actinide oxysulfides. It is obtained by reacting protactinium(V) chloride with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at 900 °C.</p>\n<p>In hydrides and nitrides, protactinium has a low oxidation state of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250 °C, and the nitride is a product of ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride. This bright yellow solid is stable to heating to 800 °C in vacuum. Protactinium carbide PaC is formed by reduction of protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400 °C. Protactinium forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH). It has an unusual polymeric structure with helical chains where the protactinium atom has coordination number of 12 and is surrounded by six BH ions.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe proposed structure of the Pa(CH) molecule</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Organometallic compounds</h3>\n<p>Protactinium(IV) forms a tetrahedral complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(CH)) with four cyclopentadienyl rings, which can be synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(CH). One ring can be substituted with a halide atom. Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, Pa(CH), which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the metal atom is sandwiched between two cyclooctatetraene ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide, KCH, in tetrahydrofuran.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of protactinium</div>\n<p>Twenty-nine radioisotopes of protactinium have been discovered, the most stable being Pa with a half-life of 32,760 years, Pa with a half-life of 27 days, and Pa with a half-life of 17.4 days. All of the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than 1.6 days, and the majority of these have half-lives less than 1.8 seconds. Protactinium also has two nuclear isomers, Pa (half-life 1.2 milliseconds) and Pa (half-life 1.17 minutes).</p>\n<p>The primary decay mode for isotopes of protactinium lighter than (and including) the most stable isotope Pa (i.e., Pa to Pa) is alpha decay and the primary mode for the heavier isotopes (i.e., Pa to Pa) is beta decay. The primary decay products of isotopes of protactinium lighter than (and including) Pa are actinium isotopes and the primary decay products for the heavier isotopes of protactinium are uranium isotopes.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>Although protactinium is located in the periodic table between uranium and thorium, which both have numerous applications, owing to its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of scientific research.</p>\n<p>Protactinium-231 arises from the decay of uranium-235 formed in nuclear reactors, and by the reaction Th&nbsp;+&nbsp;n&nbsp;→&nbsp;Th&nbsp;+&nbsp;2n and subsequent beta decay. It may support a nuclear chain reaction, which could in principle be used to build nuclear weapons. The physicist Walter Seifritz once estimated the associated critical mass as 750±180&nbsp;kg, but this possibility (of a chain reaction) has been ruled out by other nuclear physicists since then.</p>\n<p>With the advent of highly sensitive mass spectrometers, an application of Pa as a tracer in geology and paleoceanography has become possible. So, the ratio of protactinium-231 to thorium-230 is used for radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling of the formation of minerals. In particular, its evaluation in oceanic sediments allowed to reconstruct the movements of North Atlantic water bodies during the last melting of Ice Age glaciers. Some of the protactinium-related dating variations rely on the analysis of the relative concentrations for several long-living members of the uranium decay chain – uranium, thorium and protactinium, for example. These elements have 6, 5 and 4 f-electrons in the outer shell and thus favor +6, +5 and +4 oxidation states, respectively, and show different physical and chemical properties. So, thorium and protactinium, but not uranium compounds are poorly soluble in aqueous solutions, and precipitate into sediments; the precipitation rate is faster for thorium than for protactinium. Besides, the concentration analysis for both protactinium-231 (half-life 32,750 years) and thorium-230 (half-life 75,380 years) allows to improve the accuracy compared to when only one isotope is measured; this double-isotope method is also weakly sensitive to inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the isotopes and to variations in their precipitation rate.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Protactinium is both toxic and highly radioactive and thus all manipulations with it are performed in a sealed glove box. Its major isotope Pa has a specific activity of 0.048 Ci/gram and primarily emits alpha-particles of the energy 5 MeV, which can be stopped by a thin layer of any material. However, it slowly decays, with the half-life of 32,760 years, into Ac, which has a specific activity of 74 Ci/gram, emits both alpha and beta radiation, and has a much shorter half-life of 22 years. Ac, in turn, decays into lighter isotopes with even shorter half-lives and much greater specific activities (SA), as summarized in the table below showing the decay chain of protactinium-231.</p>\n\n<p>As protactinium is present in small amounts in most natural products and materials, it is ingested with food or water and inhaled with air. Only about 0.05% of ingested protactinium is absorbed into the blood and the remainder is excreted. From the blood, about 40% of the protactinium deposits in the bones, about 15% goes to the liver, 2% to the kidneys, and the rest leaves the body. The biological half-life of protactinium is about 50 years in the bones, whereas in other organs the kinetics has a fast and slow component. So in the liver 70% of protactinium have a half-life of 10 days and 30% remain for 60 days. The corresponding values for kidneys are 20% (10 days) and 80% (60 days). In all these organs, protactinium promotes cancer via its radioactivity. The maximum safe dose of Pa in the human body is 0.03 µCi that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of Pa. This isotope is 2.5×10 times more toxic than hydrocyanic acid. The maximum allowed concentrations of Pa in the air is 3×10 Bq/m.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   Donohue, J.

  "title": "Uranium",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For other uses, see Uranium (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Uranium</b> is a silvery-white metallic chemical element in the actinide series of the periodic table, with symbol <b>U</b> and atomic number&nbsp;92. A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable. The most common isotopes of uranium are uranium-238 (which has 146 neutrons) and uranium-235 (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the second highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements, lighter only than plutonium. Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead, but not as dense as gold or tungsten. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil, rock and water, and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite.</p>\n<p>In nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198–0.7202%), and a very small amount of uranium-234 (0.0050–0.0059%). Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating the age of the Earth.</p>\n<p>Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating.</p>\n<p>Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass, producing orange-red to lemon yellow hues. It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography. The 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the planet Uranus. Eugène-Melchior Péligot was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel. Research by Enrico Fermi and others starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in <i>Little Boy</i>, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety. See Nuclear proliferation.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA neutron-induced nuclear fission event involving uranium-235</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When refined, uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive metal, which is harder than most elements. It is malleable, ductile, slightly paramagnetic, strongly electropositive and is a poor electrical conductor. Uranium metal has very high density, being approximately 70% denser than lead, but slightly less dense than gold.</p>\n<p>Uranium metal reacts with almost all nonmetallic elements and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature. Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly. When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide. Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry.</p>\n<p>Uranium-235 was the first isotope that was found to be fissile. Other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. Upon bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).</p>\n<p>As little as 15&nbsp;lb (7&nbsp;kg) of uranium-235 can be used to make an atomic bomb. The first nuclear bomb used in war, Little Boy, relied on uranium fission, while the very first nuclear explosive (The gadget) and the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki (Fat Man) were plutonium bombs.</p>\n<p>Uranium metal has three allotropic forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>α (orthorhombic) stable up to 660&nbsp;°C</li>\n<li>β (tetragonal) stable from 660&nbsp;°C to 760&nbsp;°C</li>\n<li>γ (body-centered cubic) from 760&nbsp;°C to melting point—this is the most malleable and ductile state.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Military</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDepleted uranium is used by various militaries as high-density penetrators.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The major application of uranium in the military sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of depleted uranium (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor are also hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of DU became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of DU munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions of uranium compounds left in the soil (see Gulf War Syndrome).</p>\n<p>Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of DU include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. DU is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to DU is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).</p>\n<p>During the later stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, and to a lesser extent afterwards, uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.</p>\n<h3>Civilian</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe most visible civilian use of uranium is as the thermal power source used in nuclear power plants.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel nuclear power plants. One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 80&nbsp;terajoules of energy (8×10&nbsp;joules), assuming complete fission; as much energy as 3000 tonnes of coal.</p>\n<p>Commercial nuclear power plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3% uranium-235. The CANDU and Magnox designs are the only commercial reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel. Fuel used for United States Navy reactors is typically highly enriched in uranium-235 (the exact values are classified). In a breeder reactor, uranium-238 can also be converted into plutonium through the following reaction: U (n, gamma) → U -(beta) → Np -(beta) → Pu.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUranium glass glowing under UV light</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Before the discovery of radioactivity, uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes, such as uranium glass and in Fiestaware.</p>\n<p>The discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUranium glass used as lead-in seals in a vacuum capacitor</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Uranium was also used in photographic chemicals (especially uranium nitrate as a toner), in lamp filaments, to improve the appearance of dentures, and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes. Uranium salts are mordants of silk or wool. Uranyl acetate and uranyl formate are used as electron-dense \"stains\" in transmission electron microscopy, to increase the contrast of biological specimens in ultrathin sections and in negative staining of viruses, isolated cell organelles and macromolecules.</p>\n<p>The discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element. The long half-life of the isotope uranium-238 (4.51×10 years) makes it well-suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating, including uranium-thorium dating, uranium-lead dating and uranium-uranium dating. Uranium metal is used for X-ray targets in the making of high-energy X-rays.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Prehistoric naturally occurring fission</h3>\n<div>Main article: Natural nuclear fission reactor</div>\n<p>In 1972 French physicist Francis Perrin discovered fifteen ancient and no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the Oklo mine in Gabon, West Africa, collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors. The ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old; then, uranium-235 constituted about 3% of the total uranium on Earth. This is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur, provided other supporting conditions exist. The capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the U.S. federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository.</p>\n<h3>Pre-discovery use</h3>\n<p>The use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 CE, when it was used to add a yellow color to ceramic glazes. Yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples, Italy by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912. Starting in the late Middle Ages, pitchblende was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic) and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry. In the early 19th century, the world's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines.</p>\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAntoine Henri Becquerel discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity by exposing a photographic plate to uranium in 1896.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The discovery of the element is credited to the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth. While he was working in his experimental laboratory in Berlin in 1789, Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely sodium diuranate) by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide. Klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder, which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself (in fact, that powder was an oxide of uranium). He named the newly discovered element after the planet Uranus, (named after the primordial Greek god of the sky), which had been discovered eight years earlier by William Herschel.</p>\n<p>In 1841, Eugène-Melchior Péligot, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (Central School of Arts and Manufactures) in Paris, isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium. Uranium was not seen as being particularly dangerous during much of the 19th century, leading to the development of various uses for the element. One such use for the oxide was the aforementioned but no longer secret coloring of pottery and glass.</p>\n<p>Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity by using uranium in 1896. Becquerel made the discovery in Paris by leaving a sample of a uranium salt, KUO(SO) (potassium uranyl sulfate), on top of an unexposed photographic plate in a drawer and noting that the plate had become \"fogged\". He determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate.</p>\n<h3>Fission research</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCubes and cuboids of uranium produced during the Manhattan project</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A team led by Enrico Fermi in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays (electrons or positrons from the elements produced; see beta particle). The fission products were at first mistaken for new elements of atomic numbers 93 and 94, which the Dean of the Faculty of Rome, Orso Mario Corbino, christened <i>ausonium</i> and <i>hesperium</i>, respectively. The experiments leading to the discovery of uranium's ability to fission (break apart) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Hahn's laboratory in Berlin. Lise Meitner and her nephew, physicist Otto Robert Frisch, published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process \"nuclear fission\". Soon after, Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction. Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939, and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235. Further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium, which, like uranium-235, is also fissionable by thermal neutrons. These discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power.</p>\n<p>On 2 December 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project, another team led by Enrico Fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1. Working in a lab below the stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400&nbsp;short tons (360&nbsp;metric tons) of graphite, 58&nbsp;short tons (53&nbsp;metric tons) of uranium oxide, and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of uranium metal, a majority of which was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant in a makeshift production process.</p>\n<h3>Bombs</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe mushroom cloud over Hiroshima after the dropping of the uranium-based atomic bomb nicknamed 'Little Boy'</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Two major types of atomic bombs were developed by the United States during World War II: a uranium-based device (codenamed \"Little Boy\") whose fissile material was highly enriched uranium, and a plutonium-based device (see Trinity test and \"Fat Man\") whose plutonium was derived from uranium-238. The uranium-based Little Boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500&nbsp;tonnes of TNT, the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings and killed approximately 75,000 people (see Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). Initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare, and that nuclear proliferation could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks, but within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world.</p>\n<h3>Reactors</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFour light bulbs lit with electricity generated from the first artificial electricity-producing nuclear reactor, EBR-I (1951)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, formerly known as the Clinton Pile and X-10 Pile, was the world's second artificial nuclear reactor (after Enrico Fermi's Chicago Pile) and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation. Argonne National Laboratory’s Experimental Breeder Reactor I, located at the Atomic Energy Commission’s National Reactor Testing Station near Arco, Idaho became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 December 1951. Initially, four 150-watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor, but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility (later, the town of Arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by BORAX-III, another reactor designed and operated by Argonne National Laboratory). The world's first commercial scale nuclear power station, Obninsk in the Soviet Union, began generation with its reactor AM-1 on 27 June 1954. Other early nuclear power plants were Calder Hall in England which began generation on 17 October 1956 and the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania which began on 26 May 1958. Nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a submarine, the USS Nautilus, in 1954.</p>\n<h3>Contamination and the Cold War legacy</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nU.S. and USSR/Russian nuclear weapons stockpiles, 1945–2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Above-ground nuclear tests by the Soviet Union and the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s and by France into the 1970s and 1980s spread a significant amount of fallout from uranium daughter isotopes around the world. Additional fallout and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents.</p>\n<p>Uranium miners have a higher incidence of cancer. An excess risk of lung cancer among Navajo uranium miners, for example, has been documented and linked to their occupation. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a 1990 law in the USA, required $100,000 in \"compassion payments\" to uranium miners diagnosed with cancer or other respiratory ailments.</p>\n<p>During the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600&nbsp;short tons (540&nbsp;metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the federal government of the United States, spent approximately US $550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. <i>Scientific American</i> reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<h3>Biotic and abiotic</h3>\n<div>Main article: Uranium in the environment</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUraninite, also known as pitchblende, is the most common ore mined to extract uranium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and. Along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron, it is only naturally formed in supernovae. The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.</p>\n<p>Uranium's average concentration in the Earth's crust is (depending on the reference) 2 to 4 parts per million, or about 40 times as abundant as silver. The Earth's crust from the surface to 25&nbsp;km (15&nbsp;mi) down is calculated to contain 10&nbsp;kg (2×10&nbsp;lb) of uranium while the oceans may contain 10&nbsp;kg (2×10&nbsp;lb). The concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million (up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers), and its concentration in sea water is 3 parts per billion.</p>\n<p>Uranium is more plentiful than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or silver, and it is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals including uraninite (the most common uranium ore), carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<i>Citrobacter</i> species can have concentrations of uranium in their bodies 300 times higher than in the surrounding environment.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Some bacteria such as S. putrefaciens and G. metallireducens have been shown to reduce U(VI) to U(IV).</p>\n<p>Some organisms, such as the lichen <i>Trapelia involuta</i> or microorganisms such as the bacterium <i>Citrobacter</i>, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times higher than in their environment. <i>Citrobacter</i> species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.</p>\n<p>In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline pH. This leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A <i>Sphingomonas</i> sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in <i>E. coli</i>.</p>\n<p>Plants absorb some uranium from soil. Dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion, and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million. Dry weight concentrations of uranium in food plants are typically lower with one to two micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat.</p>\n<h3>Production and mining</h3>\n<div>Main article: Uranium mining</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld uranium production (mines) and demand</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nYellowcake is a concentrated mixture of uranium oxides that is further refined to extract pure uranium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The worldwide production of uranium in 2010 amounted to 53,663 tonnes, of which 17,803 t (33.2%) was mined in Kazakhstan. Other important uranium mining countries are Canada (9,783 t), Australia (5,900 t), Namibia (4,496 t), Niger (4,198 t) and Russia (3,562 t).</p>\n<p>Uranium ore is mined in several ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and borehole mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides UO. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.</p>\n<p>Commercial-grade uranium can be produced through the reduction of uranium halides with alkali or alkaline earth metals. Uranium metal can also be prepared through electrolysis of KUF\n5 or UF\n4, dissolved in molten calcium chloride (CaCl\n2) and sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. Very pure uranium is produced through the thermal decomposition of uranium halides on a hot filament.</p>\n<h3>Resources and reserves</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nWorld largest Uranium mines in 2005</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>It is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at US$59 per lb of uranium, while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources (reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction). Prices went from about $10/lb in May 2003 to $138/lb in July 2007. This has caused a big increase in spending on exploration, with US$200 million being spent world wide in 2005, a 54% increase on the previous year,. This trend continued through 2006, when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over $774 million, an increase of over 250% compared to 2004. The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency said exploration figures for 2007 would likely match those for 2006.</p>\n<p>Australia has 31% of the world's known uranium ore reserves and the world's largest single uranium deposit, located at the Olympic Dam Mine in South Australia. There is a significant reserve of uranium in Bakouma a sub-prefecture in the prefecture of Mbomou in Central African Republic.</p>\n<p>Some nuclear fuel comes from nuclear weapons being dismantled, such as from the Megatons to Megawatts Program.</p>\n<p>An additional 4.6 billion tonnes of uranium are estimated to be in sea water (Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible). There have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water, but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap, which vastly outperforms previous best adsorbents, which perform surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions. \"We have shown that our adsorbents can extract five to seven times more uranium at uptake rates seven times faster than the world's best adsorbents,\" said Chris Janke, one of the inventors and a member of ORNL's Materials Science and Technology Division. HiCap also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.</p>\n<h3>Supply</h3>\n<div>Main article: Uranium market</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMonthly uranium spot price in US$ per pound. The 2007 price peak is clearly visible.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In 2005, seventeen countries produced concentrated uranium oxides, with Canada (27.9% of world production) and Australia (22.8%) being the largest producers and Kazakhstan (10.5%), Russia (8.0%), Namibia (7.5%), Niger (7.4%), Uzbekistan (5.5%), the United States (2.5%), Argentina (2.1%), Ukraine (1.9%) and China (1.7%) also producing significant amounts. Kazakhstan continues to increase production and may have become the world's largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12,826&nbsp;tonnes, compared to Canada with 11,100&nbsp;t and Australia with 9,430&nbsp;t. The ultimate available uranium is believed to be sufficient for at least the next 85 years, although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the 21st century. Uranium deposits seem to be log-normal distributed. There is a 300-fold increase in the amount of uranium recoverable for each tenfold decrease in ore grade. In other words, there is little high grade ore and proportionately much more low grade ore available.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<h3>Oxidation states and oxides</h3>\n<h4>Oxides</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Calcined uranium yellowcake as produced in many large mills contains a distribution of uranium oxidation species in various forms ranging from most oxidized to least oxidized. Particles with short residence times in a calciner will generally be less oxidized than those with long retention times or particles recovered in the stack scrubber. Uranium content is usually referenced to U\n3O\n8, which dates to the days of the Manhattan project when U\n3O\n8 was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard.</p>\n<p>Phase relationships in the uranium-oxygen system are complex. The most important oxidation states of uranium are uranium(IV) and uranium(VI), and their two corresponding oxides are, respectively, uranium dioxide (UO\n2) and uranium trioxide (UO\n3). Other uranium oxides such as uranium monoxide (UO), diuranium pentoxide (U\n2O\n5), and uranium peroxide (UO\n4·2H\n2O) also exist.</p>\n<p>The most common forms of uranium oxide are triuranium octaoxide (U\n3O\n8) and UO\n2. Both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions. Triuranium octaoxide is (depending on conditions) the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature. Uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel. At ambient temperatures, UO\n2 will gradually convert to U\n3O\n8. Because of their stability, uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal.</p>\n<h4>Aqueous chemistry</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUranium in its oxidation states III, IV, V, VI</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Salts of many oxidation states of uranium are water-soluble and may be studied in aqueous solutions. The most common ionic forms are U3+ (brown-red), U4+ (green), UO+\n2 (unstable), and UO2+\n2 (yellow), for U(III), U(IV), U(V), and U(VI), respectively. A few solid and semi-metallic compounds such as UO and US exist for the formal oxidation state uranium(II), but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state. Ions of U3+ liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable. The UO2+\n2 ion represents the uranium(VI) state and is known to form compounds such as uranyl carbonate, uranyl chloride and uranyl sulfate. UO2+\n2 also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents, the most commonly encountered of which is uranyl acetate.</p>\n<p>Unlike the uranyl salts of uranium and polyatomic ion uranium-oxide cationic forms, the uranates, salts containing a polyatomic uranium-oxide anion, are generally not water-soluble.</p>\n<h4>Carbonates</h4>\n<p>The interactions of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the Pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution. While the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water), uranium carbonates are often soluble in water. This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes.</p>\n\n<h4>Effects of pH</h4>\n<p>The uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex.</p>\n<p>When carbonate is added, uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the pH is increased. One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the pH range 6 to 8, a fact which has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels.</p>\n<h3>Hydrides, carbides and nitrides</h3>\n<p>Uranium metal heated to 250 to 300 °C (482 to 572 °F) reacts with hydrogen to form uranium hydride. Even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen. This property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium carbide, nitride, and halide compounds. Two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist: an α form that is obtained at low temperatures and a β form that is created when the formation temperature is above 250&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<p>Uranium carbides and uranium nitrides are both relatively inert semimetallic compounds that are minimally soluble in acids, react with water, and can ignite in air to form U\n3O\n8. Carbides of uranium include uranium monocarbide (UC), uranium dicarbide (UC\n2), and diuranium tricarbide (U\n2C\n3). Both UC and UC\n2 are formed by adding carbon to molten uranium or by exposing the metal to carbon monoxide at high temperatures. Stable below 1800&nbsp;°C, U\n2C\n3 is prepared by subjecting a heated mixture of UC and UC\n2 to mechanical stress. Uranium nitrides obtained by direct exposure of the metal to nitrogen include uranium mononitride (UN), uranium dinitride (UN\n2), and diuranium trinitride (U\n2N\n3).</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUranium hexafluoride is the feedstock used to separate uranium-235 from natural uranium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>All uranium fluorides are created using uranium tetrafluoride (UF\n4); UF\n4 itself is prepared by hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide. Reduction of UF\n4 with hydrogen at 1000&nbsp;°C produces uranium trifluoride (UF\n3). Under the right conditions of temperature and pressure, the reaction of solid UF\n4 with gaseous uranium hexafluoride (UF\n6) can form the intermediate fluorides of U\n2F\n9, U\n4F\n17, and UF\n5.</p>\n<p>At room temperatures, UF\n6 has a high vapor pressure, making it useful in the gaseous diffusion process to separate the rare uranium-235 from the common uranium-238 isotope. This compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>UO\n2 + 4 HF → UF\n4 + 2 H\n2O (500&nbsp;°C, endothermic)</dd>\n<dd>UF\n4 + F\n2 → UF\n6 (350&nbsp;°C, endothermic)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The resulting UF\n6, a white solid, is highly reactive (by fluorination), easily sublimes (emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly ideal gas), and is the most volatile compound of uranium known to exist.</p>\n<p>One method of preparing uranium tetrachloride (UCl\n4) is to directly combine chlorine with either uranium metal or uranium hydride. The reduction of UCl\n4 by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride (UCl\n3) while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine. All uranium chlorides react with water and air.</p>\n<p>Bromides and iodides of uranium are formed by direct reaction of, respectively, bromine and iodine with uranium or by adding UH\n3 to those element's acids. Known examples include: UBr\n3, UBr\n4, UI\n3, and UI\n4. Uranium oxyhalides are water-soluble and include UO\n2F\n2, UOCl\n2, UO\n2Cl\n2, and UO\n2Br\n2. Stability of the oxyhalides decrease as the atomic weight of the component halide increases.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<h3>Natural concentrations</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of uranium</div>\n<p>Natural uranium consists of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%). All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, rather than alpha emission.</p>\n<p>Uranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium, with a half-life of about 4.468×10 years, roughly the age of the Earth. Uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13×10 years, and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48×10 years. For natural uranium, about 49% of its alpha rays are emitted by each of U atom, and also 49% by U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the U. When the Earth was young, probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of U was probably much lower than this.</p>\n<p>Uranium-238 is usually an α emitter (occasionally, it undergoes spontaneous fission), decaying through the \"Uranium Series\" of nuclear decay, which has 18 members, all of which eventually decay into lead-206, by a variety of different decay paths.</p>\n<p>The decay series of U, which is called the actinium series has 15 members, all of which eventually decay into lead-207. The constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to daughter elements useful in radiometric dating.</p>\n<p>Uranium-234 is a member of the \"Uranium Series\", and it decays to lead-206 through a series of relatively short-lived isotopes.</p>\n<p>Uranium-233 is made from thorium-232 by neutron bombardment, usually in a nuclear reactor, and U is also fissile. Its decay series ends with thallium-205.</p>\n<p>Uranium-235 is important for both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons, because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on Earth in any significant amount that is fissile. This means it can be split into two or three fragments (fission products) by thermal neutrons.</p>\n<p>Uranium-238 is not fissile, but is a fertile isotope, because after neutron activation it can produce plutonium-239, another fissile isotope. Indeed, the U nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope uranium-239. U decays by beta emission to neptunium-239, also a beta-emitter, that decays in its turn, within a few days into plutonium-239. Pu was used as fissile material in the first atomic bomb detonated in the \"Trinity test\" on 15 July 1945 in New Mexico.</p>\n<h3>Enrichment</h3>\n<div>Main article: Enriched uranium</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCascades of gas centrifuges are used to enrich uranium ore to concentrate its fissionable isotopes.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and uranium-235 (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve this is called a 'critical mass'.</p>\n<p>To be considered 'enriched', the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3% and 5%. This process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238, called depleted uranium or 'DU'. To be considered 'depleted', the uranium-235 isotope concentration should be no more than 0.3%. The price of uranium has risen since 2001, so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35% uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $5 in 2001.</p>\n<p>The gas centrifuge process, where gaseous uranium hexafluoride (UF\n6) is separated by the difference in molecular weight between UF and UF using high-speed centrifuges, is the cheapest and leading enrichment process. The gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the Manhattan Project. In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers. Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion.</p>\n<h2>Human exposure</h2>\n<p>A person can be exposed to uranium (or its radioactive daughters such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, people who work in factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas.</p>\n<p>Most ingested uranium is excreted during digestion. Only 0.5% is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium, such as its oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin.</p>\n<p>Incorporated uranium becomes uranyl ions, which accumulate in bone, liver, kidney, and reproductive tissues. Uranium can be decontaminated from steel surfaces and aquifers.</p>\n<h3>Effects and precautions</h3>\n<p>Normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because, besides being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal. Uranium is also a reproductive toxicant. Radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation, the primary form of U decay, has a very short range, and will not penetrate skin. Uranyl (UO2+\n2) ions, such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds, have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals. While the CDC has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium, exposure to uranium and its decay products, especially radon, are widely known and significant health threats. Exposure to strontium-90, iodine-131, and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure, but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons. Although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities, those deaths were associated with generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and uranyl fluoride rather than with uranium itself. Finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric; small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature.</p>\n<p>Uranium metal is commonly handled with gloves as a sufficient precaution. Uranium concentrate is handled and contained so as to ensure that people do not inhale or ingest it.</p>\n\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>K-65 residues</li>\n<li>List of uranium mines</li>\n<li>List of countries by uranium reserves</li>\n<li>Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents</li>\n<li>Nuclear engineering</li>\n<li>Nuclear fuel cycle</li>\n<li>Nuclear physics</li>\n<li>Thorium fuel cycle</li>\n<li>Uranium bubble of 2007</li>\n<li>Uranium leak</li>\n<li>Uranium reserves</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Morss, L.R.; Edelstein, N.M. and Fuger, J., ed.

  "title": "Neptunium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Neptunium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Np</b> and atomic number 93. A radioactive metal, neptunium is the first transuranic element, and belongs to the actinide series. Its most stable isotope, Np, is a by-product of nuclear reactors and plutonium production, and it can be used as a component in neutron detection equipment. Neptunium is also found in trace amounts in uranium ores due to transmutation reactions.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The periodic table of Dmitri Mendeleev published in the 1870s showed a \" — \" in place after uranium similar to several other places for at that point undiscovered elements. Also, a 1913 publication of the known radioactive isotopes by Kasimir Fajans shows the empty place after uranium.</p>\n<h3>False reports of discovery</h3>\n<p>In 1934, Odolen Koblic extracted a small amount of material from the wash water of roasted pitchblende. He assumed the sample was element 93, and called it bohemium, but after being analyzed, it turned out that the sample was a mixture of tungsten and vanadium. Also in 1934, Enrico Fermi attempted to bombard uranium with neutrons to produce elements 93 and 94. He was also unsuccessful, but had unknowingly discovered nuclear fission. In 1938, Horia Hulubei, a Romanian physicist; and Yvette Cauchois, a French chemist; claimed to have discovered element 93 via spectroscopy in minerals. They named their element sequanium, but the claim was opposed at the time because neptunium was thought to occur exclusively artificially. However, as neptunium does occur in nature, it is possible that Hulubei and Cauchois did in fact discover neptunium.</p>\n<h3>Actual discovery</h3>\n<p>The search for element 93 in minerals was encumbered by the fact that the predictions on the chemical properties of element 93 were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinide series, and therefore placed thorium below hafnium, protactinium below tantalum, and uranium below tungsten. This periodic table suggested that element 93, at that point often named eka-rhenium, should be similar to manganese or rhenium. With this misconception it was impossible to isolate element 93 from minerals, although neptunium was later found in uranium ore, in 1952.</p>\n<p>Enrico Fermi believed that bombarding uranium with neutrons and subsequent beta decay would lead to the formation of element 93. Chemical separation of the new formed elements from the uranium yielded material with low half-life, and, therefore, Fermi announced the discovery of a new element in 1934, though this was soon found to be mistaken. Soon it was speculated and later proven that most of the material is created by nuclear fission of uranium by neutrons. Small quantities of neptunium had to be produced in Otto Hahn's experiments in late 1930s as a result of decay of U. Hahn and his colleagues experimentally confirmed production and chemical properties of U, but were unsuccessful at isolating and detecting neptunium.</p>\n<p>Neptunium (named for the planet Neptune, the next planet out from Uranus, after which uranium was named) was discovered by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in 1940 at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley. The team produced the neptunium isotope Np (2.4 day half-life) by bombarding uranium with slow moving neutrons. It was the first transuranium element produced synthetically and the first actinide series transuranium element discovered.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<p>The most stable isotope of neptunium is Np, with a half-life of two million years. Thus, all primordial neptunium should have decayed by now. However, trace amounts of the neptunium isotopes neptunium-237 through neptunium-240, are found naturally as decay products from transmutation reactions in uranium ores.</p>\n<p>Artificial Np is produced through a reaction of NpF with liquid barium or lithium at around 1200 °C and is most often extracted from spent nuclear fuel rods in kilogram amounts as a by-product in plutonium production.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 NpF\n3 + 3 Ba → 2 Np + 3 BaF\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>By weight, neptunium-237 discharges are about 5% as great as plutonium discharges and about 0.05% of spent nuclear fuel discharges. However, even this fraction still amounts to more than fifty tons per year.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Silvery in appearance, neptunium metal is chemically fairly reactive and is found in at least three allotropes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>α-neptunium, orthorhombic, density 20.45 g/cm</li>\n<li>β-neptunium (above 280 °C), tetragonal, density (313 °C) 19.36 g/cm</li>\n<li>γ-neptunium (above 577 °C), cubic, density (600 °C) 18 g/cm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Neptunium has the largest liquid range of any element, 3363 K, between the melting point and boiling point. It is the densest of all the actinides and the fifth-densest of all naturally occurring elements. Neptunium has no biological role. It is not absorbed by the digestive tract. When injected into the body, it accumulates in bones, from which it is slowly released.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of neptunium</div>\n<p>19 neptunium radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being Np with a half-life of 2.14 million years, Np with a half-life of 154,000 years, and Np with a half-life of 396.1 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 4.5 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 50 minutes. This element also has 4 meta states, with the most stable being Np (t 22.5 hours).</p>\n<p>The isotopes of neptunium range in atomic weight from 225.0339 u (Np) to 244.068 u (Np). The primary decay mode before the most stable isotope, Np, is electron capture (with a good deal of alpha emission), and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay products before Np are element 92 (uranium) isotopes (alpha emission produces element 91, protactinium, however) and the primary products after are element 94 (plutonium) isotopes.</p>\n<p>Np is fissionable. Np eventually decays to form bismuth-209 and thallium-205, unlike most other common heavy nuclei which decay to make isotopes of lead. This decay chain is known as the neptunium series.</p>\n<h2>Synthesis</h2>\n<p>Chemically, neptunium is prepared by the reduction of NpF with barium or lithium vapor at about 1200 °C. Most Np is produced in nuclear reactions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When an U atom captures a neutron, it is converted to an excited state of U. About 81% of the excited U nuclei undergo fission, but the remainder decay to the ground state of U by emitting gamma radiation. Further neutron capture creates U which has a half-life of 7 days and thus quickly decays to Np through beta decay. During beta decay, the excited U emits an electron, while the atomic weak interaction converts a neutron to a proton, thus creating Np.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>U is also produced via an (n,2n) reaction with U. This only happens with very energetic neutrons.</li>\n<li>Np is the product of alpha decay of Am.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Heavier isotopes of neptunium decay quickly, and lighter isotopes of neptunium cannot be produced by neutron capture, so chemical separation of neptunium from cooled spent nuclear fuel gives nearly pure Np.</p>\n<h2>Chemistry</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNeptunium ions in solution.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>This element has four ionic oxidation states while in solution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Np (pale purple), analogous to the rare earth ion Pm</li>\n<li>Np (yellow-green)</li>\n<li>NpO+\n2 (green-blue)</li>\n<li>NpO2+\n2 (pale pink)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Neptunium(III) hydroxide is not soluble in water and does not dissolve in excess alkali.

Np will capture a neutron to form Np and beta decay with a half-life of two days to Pu.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Pu also exists in sizable quantities in spent nuclear fuel but would have to be separated from other isotopes of plutonium.</p>\n<h3>Weapons applications</h3>\n<p>Neptunium is fissionable, and could theoretically be used as fuel in a fast neutron reactor or a nuclear weapon, with a critical mass of around 60 kilograms. In 1992, the U.S. Department of Energy declassified the statement that neptunium-237 \"can be used for a nuclear explosive device\". It is not believed that an actual weapon has ever been constructed using neptunium. As of 2009, the world production of neptunium-237 by commercial power reactors was over 1000 critical masses a year, but to extract the isotope from irradiated fuel elements would be a major industrial undertaking.</p>\n<p>In September 2002, researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory briefly created the first known nuclear critical mass using neptunium in combination with shells of enriched uranium (U-235), discovering that the critical mass of a bare sphere of neptunium-237 \"ranges from kilogram weights in the high fifties to low sixties,\" showing that it \"is about as good a bomb material as U-235.\" The United States Federal government made plans in March 2004 to move America's supply of separated neptunium to a nuclear-waste disposal site in Nevada.</p>\n<h3>Physics applications</h3>\n<p>Np is used in devices for detecting high-energy (MeV) neutrons.</p>\n<h2>Role in nuclear waste</h2>\n<p>Neptunium-237 is the most mobile actinide in the deep geological repository environment. This makes it and its predecessors such as americium-241 candidates of interest for destruction by nuclear transmutation. Neptunium accumulates in commercial household ionization-chamber smoke detectors from decay of the (typically) 0.2 microgram of americium-241 initially present as a source of ionizing radiation. With a half-life of 432 years, the americium-241 in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 20 years, and about 15% after 100 years.</p>\n<p>Due to its long half-life, neptunium becomes the major contributor of the total radiation in 10,000 years. As it is unclear what happens to the containment in that long time span, an extraction of the neptunium would minimize the contamination of the environment if the nuclear waste could be mobilized after several thousand years.</p>\n<h2>Biological role and precautions</h2>\n<p>Neptunium does not have any biological role. It is absorbed via the digestive tract. When injected it concentrates in the bones, from which it is slowly released.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   Criticality of a Np Sphere</li>\n<li>^ Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition, CRC press.</li>\n<li>^     C.

  "title": "Plutonium",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the radioactive element.  For other uses, see Plutonium (disambiguation).</div>\n\n<p><b>Plutonium</b> is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with the symbol&nbsp;<b>Pu</b> and atomic number&nbsp;94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air, and forming a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that can spontaneously ignite. It is radioactive and can accumulate in the bones. These properties make the handling of plutonium dangerous.</p>\n<p>Plutonium is the heaviest primordial element by virtue of its most stable isotope, plutonium-244, whose half-life of about 80&nbsp;million years is just long enough for the element to be found in trace quantities in nature. Plutonium is mostly a byproduct of nuclear reactions in reactors where some of the neutrons released by the fission process convert uranium-238 nuclei into plutonium.</p>\n<p>Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, meaning that they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, leading to applications in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Plutonium-240 exhibits a high rate of spontaneous fission, raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a sample's usability for weapons or reactor fuel, and determines its grade.</p>\n<p>Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88&nbsp;years and emits alpha particles. It is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power some spacecraft. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.</p>\n<p>A team led by Glenn T. Seaborg and Edwin McMillan at the University of California, Berkeley laboratory first synthesized plutonium in 1940 by bombarding uranium-238 with deuterons. Trace amounts of plutonium were subsequently discovered in nature. Producing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the Manhattan Project during World War II, which developed the first atomic bombs. The first nuclear test, \"Trinity\" (July 1945), and the second atomic bomb used to destroy a city (Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945), \"Fat Man\", both had cores of plutonium-239. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred during and after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests (now banned).</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Plutonium, like most metals, has a bright silvery appearance at first, much like nickel, but it oxidizes very quickly to a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported. At room temperature plutonium is in its α form (<i>alpha</i>). This, the most common structural form of the element (allotrope), is about as hard and brittle as grey cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile. Unlike most metals, it is not a good conductor of heat or electricity. It has a low melting point (640&nbsp;°C) and an unusually high boiling point (3,228&nbsp;°C).</p>\n<p>Alpha decay, the release of a high-energy helium nucleus, is the most common form of radioactive decay for plutonium. A 5&nbsp;kg mass of Pu contains about 12.5 × 10 atoms. With a half-life of 24,100 years, about 11.5 × 10 of its atoms decay each second by emitting a 5.157 MeV alpha particle. This amounts to 9.68 watts of power. Heat produced by the deceleration of these alpha particles makes it warm to the touch.</p>\n<p>Resistivity is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100&nbsp;K, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20&nbsp;K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.</p>\n<p>Because of self-irradiation, a sample of plutonium fatigues throughout its crystal structure, meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time. Self-irradiation can also lead to annealing which counteracts some of the fatigue effects as temperature increases above 100&nbsp;K.</p>\n<p>Unlike most materials, plutonium <i>increases</i> in density when it melts, by 2.5%, but the liquid metal exhibits a linear decrease in density with temperature. Near the melting point, the liquid plutonium has also very high viscosity and surface tension as compared to other metals.</p>\n<h3>Allotropes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Allotropes of plutonium</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPlutonium has six allotropes at ambient pressure: <b>alpha</b>&nbsp;(α), <b>beta</b>&nbsp;(β), <b>gamma</b>&nbsp;(γ), <b>delta</b>&nbsp;(δ), <b>delta&nbsp;prime</b>&nbsp;(δ'), &amp; <b>epsilon</b>&nbsp;(ε)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Plutonium normally has six allotropes and forms a seventh (zeta, ζ) at high temperature within a limited pressure range. These allotropes, which are different structural modifications or forms of an element, have very similar internal energies but significantly varying densities and crystal structures. This makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature, pressure, or chemistry, and allows for dramatic volume changes following phase transitions from one allotropic form to another. Densities of the different allotropes vary from 16.00&nbsp;g/cm to 19.86&nbsp;g/cm.</p>\n<p>The presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult, as it changes state very readily. For example, the α form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium. It has machining characteristics similar to cast iron but changes to the plastic and malleable β form (<i>beta</i>) at slightly higher temperatures. The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood. The α form has a low-symmetry monoclinic structure, hence its brittleness, strength, compressibility, and poor thermal conductivity.</p>\n<p>Plutonium in the δ form normally exists in the 310&nbsp;°C to 452&nbsp;°C range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with a small percentage of gallium, aluminium, or cerium, enhancing workability and allowing it to be welded. The delta form has more typical metallic character, and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium. In fission weapons, the explosive shock waves used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual delta phase plutonium to the denser alpha form, significantly helping to achieve supercriticality. The ε phase, the highest temperature solid allotrope, exhibits anomalously high atomic self-diffusion compared to other elements.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear fission</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA ring of weapons-grade 99.96% pure electrorefined plutonium, enough for one bomb core. The ring weighs 5.3&nbsp;kg, is ca. 11&nbsp;cm in diameter and its shape helps with criticality safety.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Plutonium is a radioactive actinide metal whose isotope, plutonium-239, is one of the three primary fissile isotopes (uranium-233 and uranium-235 are the other two); plutonium-241 is also highly fissile. To be considered fissile, an isotope's atomic nucleus must be able to break apart or fission when struck by a slow moving neutron and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by splitting further nuclei.</p>\n<p>Pure plutonium-239 may have a multiplication factor (k) larger than one, which means that if the metal is present in sufficient quantity and with an appropriate geometry (e.g., a sphere of sufficient size), it can form a critical mass. During fission, a fraction of the binding energy, which holds a nucleus together, is released as a large amount of electromagnetic and kinetic energy (much of the latter being quickly converted to thermal energy). Fission of a kilogram of plutonium-239 can produce an explosion equivalent to 21,000 tons of TNT (88,000 GJ). It is this energy that makes plutonium-239 useful in nuclear weapons and reactors.</p>\n<p>The presence of the isotope plutonium-240 in a sample limits its nuclear bomb potential, as plutonium-240 has a relatively high spontaneous fission rate (~440 fissions per second per gram—over 1,000 neutrons per second per gram), raising the background neutron levels and thus increasing the risk of predetonation. Plutonium is identified as either weapons-grade, fuel grade, or power reactor grade based on the percentage of plutonium-240 that it contains. Weapons-grade plutonium contains less than 7% plutonium-240. Fuel grade plutonium contains from 7% to less than 19%, and power reactor grade contains 19% or more plutonium-240. Supergrade plutonium, with less than 4% of plutonium-240, is used in U.S. Navy weapons stored in proximity to ship and submarine crews, due to its lower radioactivity. The isotope plutonium-238 is not fissile but can undergo nuclear fission easily with fast neutrons as well as alpha decay.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes and synthesis</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nUranium-plutonium and thorium-uranium chains</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of plutonium</div>\n<p>Twenty radioactive isotopes of plutonium have been characterized. The longest-lived are plutonium-244, with a half-life of 80.8&nbsp;million years, plutonium-242, with a half-life of 373,300&nbsp;years, and plutonium-239, with a half-life of 24,110&nbsp;years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 7,000&nbsp;years. This element also has eight metastable states, though all have half-lives less than one second.</p>\n<p>The isotopes of plutonium range in mass number from 228 to 247. The primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most stable isotope, plutonium-244, are spontaneous fission and α emission, mostly forming uranium (92 protons) and neptunium (93 protons) isotopes as decay products (neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes). The primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium-244 is β emission, mostly forming americium (95 protons) isotopes as decay products. Plutonium-241 is the parent isotope of the neptunium decay series, decaying to americium-241 via β or electron emission.</p>\n<p>Plutonium-238 and 239 are the most widely synthesized isotopes. Plutonium-239 is synthesized via the following reaction using uranium (U) and neutrons (n) via beta decay (β) with neptunium (Np) as an intermediate:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Neutrons from the fission of uranium-235 are captured by uranium-238 nuclei to form uranium-239; a beta decay converts a neutron into a proton to form Np-239 (half-life 2.36&nbsp;days) and another beta decay forms plutonium-239. Workers on the Tube Alloys project had predicted this reaction theoretically in 1940.</p>\n<p>Plutonium-238 is synthesized by bombarding uranium-238 with deuterons (D, the nuclei of heavy hydrogen) in the following reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In this process, a deuteron hitting uranium-238 produces two neutrons and neptunium-238, which spontaneously decays by emitting negative beta particles to form plutonium-238.</p>\n<h3>Decay heat and fission properties</h3>\n<p>Plutonium isotopes undergo radioactive decay, which produces decay heat. Different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass. The decay heat is usually listed as watt/kilogram, or milliwatt/gram. In case of larger pieces of plutonium (e.g. a weapon pit) and inadequate heat removal the resulting self-heating may be significant. All isotopes produce weak gamma on decay.</p>\n\n<p>Americium-241, the decay product of plutonium-241, has half-life of 430 years, 1.2 spontaneous fissions per gram per second, and decay heat of 114 watts per kilogram. As its decay produces highly penetrative gamma rays, its presence in plutonium, determined by the original concentration of plutonium-241 and the sample age, increases the radiation exposure of surrounding structures and personnel.</p>\n<h3>Compounds and chemistry</h3>\n<div>See also: Plutonium compounds</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nVarious oxidation states of plutonium in solution</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>At room temperature, pure plutonium is silvery in color but gains a tarnish when oxidized. The element displays four common ionic oxidation states in aqueous solution and one rare one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pu(III), as Pu (blue lavender)</li>\n<li>Pu(IV), as Pu (yellow brown)</li>\n<li>Pu(V), as PuO+\n2 (light pink)</li>\n<li>Pu(VI), as PuO2+\n2 (pink orange)</li>\n<li>Pu(VII), as PuO3−\n5 (green)–the heptavalent ion is rare</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The color shown by plutonium solutions depends on both the oxidation state and the nature of the acid anion. It is the acid anion that influences the degree of complexing—how atoms connect to a central atom—of the plutonium species.</p>\n<p>Metallic plutonium is produced by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium, calcium or lithium at 1200&nbsp;°C. It is attacked by acids, oxygen, and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric, hydroiodic and perchloric acids. Molten metal must be kept in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air. At 135&nbsp;°C the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in carbon tetrachloride.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPlutonium pyrophoricity can cause it to look like a glowing ember under certain conditions.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTwenty micrograms of pure plutonium hydroxide.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Plutonium is a reactive metal. In moist air or moist argon, the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing a mixture of oxides and hydrides. If the metal is exposed long enough to a limited amount of water vapor, a powdery surface coating of PuO is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO.</p>\n<p>With this coating, the metal is pyrophoric, meaning it can ignite spontaneously, so plutonium metal is usually handled in an inert, dry atmosphere of nitrogen or argon. Oxygen retards the effects of moisture and acts as a passivating agent.</p>\n<p>Plutonium shows enormous, and reversible, reaction rates with pure hydrogen, forming plutonium hydride. It also reacts readily with oxygen, forming PuO and PuO as well as intermediate oxides; plutonium oxide fills 40% more volume than plutonium metal. The metal reacts with the halogens, giving rise to compounds with the general formula PuX where X can be F, Cl, Br or I and PuF is also seen. The following oxyhalides are observed: PuOCl, PuOBr and PuOI. It will react with carbon to form PuC, nitrogen to form PuN and silicon to form PuSi.</p>\n<p>Crucibles used to contain plutonium need to be able to withstand its strongly reducing properties. Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can tolerate this. Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.</p>\n<p>Cerium is used as a chemical simulant of plutonium for development of containment, extraction, and other technologies.</p>\n<h4>Electronic structure</h4>\n<p>Plutonium is an element in which the 5f electrons are the transition border between delocalized and localized; it is therefore considered one of the most complex elements. The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure. The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5f7s and 5f7s6d configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.</p>\n<h3>Alloys</h3>\n<p>Plutonium can form alloys and intermediate compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals; and magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium of the alkaline earth metals; and europium and ytterbium of the rare earth metals. Partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten, which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium. Gallium, aluminium, americium, scandium and cerium can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature. Silicon, indium, zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable δ state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of hafnium, holmium and thallium also allows retaining some of the δ phase at room temperature. Neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures.</p>\n<p>Plutonium alloys can be produced by adding a metal to molten plutonium. If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, plutonium can be added in the form of oxides or halides. The δ phase plutonium-gallium and plutonium-aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium(III) fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium, which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plutonium-gallium is used for stabilizing the δ phase of plutonium, avoiding the α-phase and α-δ related issues. Its main use is in pits of implosion nuclear weapons.</li>\n<li><b>Plutonium-aluminium</b> is an alternative to the Pu-Ga alloy. It was the original element considered for δ phase stabilization, but its tendency to react with the alpha particles and release neutrons reduces its usability for nuclear weapon pits. Plutonium-aluminium alloy can be also used as a component of nuclear fuel.</li>\n<li><b>Plutonium-gallium-cobalt</b> alloy (PuCoGa) is an unconventional superconductor, showing superconductivity below 18.5 kelvin, an order of magnitude higher than the highest between heavy fermion systems, and has large critical current.</li>\n<li><b>Plutonium-zirconium</b> alloy can be used as nuclear fuel.</li>\n<li><b>Plutonium-cerium</b> and <b>plutonium-cerium-cobalt</b> alloys are used as nuclear fuels.</li>\n<li><b>Plutonium-uranium</b>, with about 15–30&nbsp;mol.% plutonium, can be used as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors. Its pyrophoric nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components. Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper did not improve disintegration rates markedly, zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well. Addition of titanium and/or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.</li>\n<li><b>Plutonium-uranium-titanium</b> and <b>plutonium-uranium-zirconium</b> were investigated for use as nuclear fuels. The addition of the third element increases corrosion resistance, reduces flammability, and improves ductility, fabricability, strength, and thermal expansion. <b>Plutonium-uranium-molybdenum</b> has the best corrosion resistance, forming a protective film of oxides, but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons.</li>\n<li><b>Thorium-uranium-plutonium</b> was investigated as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<p>Trace amounts of at least three plutonium isotopes (plutonium-238, 239, and 244) can be found in nature. Small traces of plutonium-239, a few parts per trillion, and its decay products are naturally found in some concentrated ores of uranium, such as the natural nuclear fission reactor in Oklo, Gabon. The ratio of plutonium-239 to uranium at the Cigar Lake Mine uranium deposit ranges from 2.4 × 10 to 44 × 10. Even smaller amounts of primordial plutonium-244 occur naturally due to its relatively long half-life of about 80&nbsp;million years. These trace amounts of Pu originate in the following fashion: On rare occasions, U undergoes spontaneous fission, and in the process, the nucleus emits one or two free neutrons with some kinetic energy. When one of these neutrons strikes the nucleus of another U atom, it is absorbed by the atom, which becomes U. With a relatively short half-life, U-239 decays to neptunium-239 (Np), and then Np decays into Pu.</p>\n<p>Since the relatively long-lived isotope plutonium-240 occurs in the decay chain of plutonium-244 it should also be present, albeit 10,000 times rarer still. Finally, exceedingly small amounts of plutonium-238, attributed to the extremely rare double beta decay of uranium-238, have been found in natural uranium samples.</p>\n<p>Minute traces of plutonium are usually found in the human body due to the 550 atmospheric and underwater nuclear tests that have been carried out, and to a small number of major nuclear accidents. Most atmospheric and underwater nuclear testing was stopped by the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which was signed and ratified by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and other nations. Continued atmospheric nuclear weapons testing since 1963 by non-treaty nations included those by China (atomic bomb test above the Gobi Desert in 1964, hydrogen bomb test in 1967, and follow-on tests), and France (tests as recently as the 1990s). Because it is deliberately manufactured for nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, plutonium-239 is the most abundant isotope of plutonium by far.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n<p>Enrico Fermi and a team of scientists at the University of Rome reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934. Fermi called the element <i>hesperium</i> and mentioned it in his Nobel Lecture in 1938. The sample was actually a mixture of barium, krypton, and other elements, but this was not known at the time because nuclear fission had not been discovered yet.</p>\n<p>The breakthrough with plutonium was at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge by Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather. They realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. This is because U-238 absorbs slow neutrons and forms a new isotope U-239. The new isotope's nucleus rapidly emits an electron through beta decay producing a new element with a mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93. This element's nucleus then also emits an electron and becomes a new element of mass 239 but with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half-life. Bretscher and Feather showed theoretically feasible grounds that element 94 would be readily 'fissionable' by both slow and fast neutrons, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and could easily be separated from it.</p>\n<p>This new development was also confirmed in independent work by Edwin M. McMillan and Philip Abelson at Berkeley Radiation Laboratory also in 1940. Nicholas Kemmer of the Cambridge team proposed the names neptunium for the new element 93 and plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus (uranium being element 92). The Americans fortuitously suggested the same names.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGlenn T. Seaborg and his team at Berkeley were the first to produce plutonium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Plutonium (specifically, plutonium-238) was first produced and isolated on December 14, 1940, and chemically identified on February 23, 1941, by Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, Edwin M. McMillan, J. W. Kennedy, and A. C. Wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium in the 60-inch (150&nbsp;cm) cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. In the 1940 experiment, neptunium-238 was created directly by the bombardment but decayed by beta emission with a half-life of a little over two days, which indicated the formation of element 94.</p>\n<p>A paper documenting the discovery was prepared by the team and sent to the journal <i>Physical Review</i> in March 1941. The paper was withdrawn before publication after the discovery that an isotope of the new element (plutonium-239) could undergo nuclear fission in a way that might be useful in an atomic bomb. Publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to security concerns.</p>\n<p>Edwin McMillan had recently named the first transuranium element after the planet Neptune and suggested that element&nbsp;94, being the next element in the series, be named for what was then considered the next planet, Pluto. Seaborg originally considered the name \"plutium\", but later thought that it did not sound as good as \"plutonium.\" He chose the letters \"Pu\" as a joke, which passed without notice into the periodic table. Alternative names considered by Seaborg and others were \"ultimium\" or \"extremium\" because of the erroneous belief that they had found the last possible element on the periodic table.</p>\n<h3>Early research</h3>\n<p>The basic chemistry of plutonium was found to resemble uranium after a few months of initial study. Early research was continued at the secret Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. On August 18, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50&nbsp;micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1&nbsp;microgram was isolated. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight.</p>\n<p>In November 1943 some plutonium trifluoride was reduced to create the first sample of plutonium metal: a few micrograms of metallic beads. Enough plutonium was produced to make it the first synthetically made element to be visible with the unaided eye.</p>\n<p>The nuclear properties of plutonium-239 were also studied; researchers found that when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.</p>\n<h3>Production during the Manhattan Project</h3>\n<p>During World War II the U.S. government established the Manhattan Project, which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb. The three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium production facility at what is now the Hanford Site, the uranium enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the weapons research and design laboratory, now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe Hanford B Reactor face under construction—the first plutonium-production reactor.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The first production reactor that made plutonium-239 was the X-10 Graphite Reactor. It went online in 1943 and was built at a facility in Oak Ridge that later became the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</p>\n<p>On April 5, 1944, Emilio Segrè at Los Alamos received the first sample of reactor-produced plutonium from Oak Ridge. Within ten days, he discovered that reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of the isotope plutonium-240 than cyclotron-produced plutonium. Plutonium-240 has a high spontaneous fission rate, raising the overall background neutron level of the plutonium sample. The original gun-type plutonium weapon, code-named \"Thin Man\", had to be abandoned as a result—the increased number of spontaneous neutrons meant that nuclear pre-detonation (a fizzle) would be likely.</p>\n<p>The entire plutonium weapon design effort at Los Alamos was soon changed to the more complicated implosion device, code-named \"Fat Man.\" With an implosion weapon, a solid (or, in later designs, hollow) sphere of plutonium is compressed to a high density with explosive lenses—a technically more daunting task than the simple gun-type design, but necessary to use plutonium for weapons purposes. (Enriched uranium, by contrast, can be used with either method.)</p>\n<p>Construction of the Hanford B Reactor, the first industrial-sized nuclear reactor for the purposes of material production, was completed in March 1945. B Reactor produced the fissile material for the plutonium weapons used during World War II. B, D and F were the initial reactors built at Hanford, and six additional plutonium-producing reactors were built later at the site.</p>\n<p>In 2004, a safe was discovered during excavations of a burial trench at the Hanford nuclear site. Inside the safe were various items, including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently identified as the oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist. Isotope analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the X-10 reactor at Oak Ridge during 1944.</p>\n<h3>Trinity and Fat Man atomic bombs</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBecause of the presence of plutonium-240 in reactor-bred plutonium, the implosion design was developed for the \"Fat Man\" and \"Trinity\" weapons</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The first atomic bomb test, codenamed \"Trinity\" and detonated on July 16, 1945, near Alamogordo, New Mexico, used plutonium as its fissile material. The implosion design of \"the gadget\", as the Trinity device was code-named, used conventional explosive lenses to compress a sphere of plutonium into a supercritical mass, which was simultaneously showered with neutrons from the \"Urchin\", an initiator made of polonium and beryllium (neutron source: (α, n) reaction). Together, these ensured a runaway chain reaction and explosion. The overall weapon weighed over 4 tonnes, although it used just 6.2&nbsp;kg of plutonium in its core. About 20% of the plutonium used in the Trinity weapon underwent fission, resulting in an explosion with an energy equivalent to approximately 20,000 tons of TNT.</p>\n<p>An identical design was used in the \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945, killing 70,000 people and wounding another 100,000. The \"Little Boy\" bomb dropped on Hiroshima three days earlier used uranium-235, not plutonium. Japan capitulated on August 15 to General Douglas MacArthur. Only after the announcement of the first atomic bombs was the existence of plutonium made public.</p>\n<h3>Cold War use and waste</h3>\n<p>Large stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium were built up by both the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. The U.S. reactors at Hanford and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina produced 103&nbsp;tonnes, and an estimated 170&nbsp;tonnes of military-grade plutonium was produced in USSR. Each year about 20&nbsp;tonnes of the element is still produced as a by-product of the nuclear power industry. As much as 1000&nbsp;tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200&nbsp;tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons. SIPRI estimated the world plutonium stockpile in 2007 as about 500 tons, divided equally between weapon and civilian stocks.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nProposed waste storage tunnel design for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Since the end of the Cold War these stockpiles have become a focus of nuclear proliferation concerns. In the U.S., some plutonium extracted from dismantled nuclear weapons is melted to form glass logs of plutonium oxide that weigh two&nbsp;tonnes. The glass is made of borosilicates mixed with cadmium and gadolinium. These logs are planned to be encased in stainless steel and stored as much as 4&nbsp;km (2&nbsp;mi) underground in bore holes that will be back-filled with concrete. As of 2008, the only facility in the U.S. that was scheduled to store plutonium in this way was the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which is about 100 miles (160&nbsp;km) north-east of Las Vegas, Nevada. Local and state opposition to this plan delayed efforts to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. In March 2010, the Department of Energy withdrew its license application for the Yucca Mountain repository \"with prejudice\" and eliminated funding for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, which had managed the Yucca Mountain site for 25 years, canceling the program.</p>\n<h3>Medical experimentation</h3>\n<div>See also: Human radiation experiments&nbsp;and The Plutonium Files</div>\n<p>During and after the end of World War II, scientists working on the Manhattan Project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and human subjects. Animal studies found that a few milligrams of plutonium per kilogram of tissue is a lethal dose.</p>\n<p>In the case of human subjects, this involved injecting solutions containing (typically) five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill, or to have a life expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition. This was reduced to one microgram in July 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more dangerous than radium.</p>\n<p>Eighteen human test subjects were injected with plutonium without informed consent. The tests were used to create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body in order to develop safety standards for working with plutonium.</p>\n<p>The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the Hippocratic Oath. More sympathetic commentators have noted that while it was definitely a breach in trust and ethics, \"the effects of the plutonium injections were not as damaging to the subjects as the early news stories painted, nor were they so inconsequential as many scientists, then and now, believe.\"</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Explosives</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan in 1945 had a plutonium core.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The isotope plutonium-239 is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons, due to its ease of fission and availability. Encasing the bomb's plutonium pit in a tamper (an optional layer of dense material) decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach critical mass by reflecting escaping neutrons back into the plutonium core. This reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16&nbsp;kg to 10&nbsp;kg, which is a sphere with a diameter of about 10 centimeters (4&nbsp;in). This critical mass is about a third of that for uranium-235.</p>\n<p>The \"Fat Man\"–type plutonium bombs produced during the Manhattan Project used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2&nbsp;kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. (See also nuclear weapon design.) Hypothetically, as little as 4&nbsp;kg of plutonium—and maybe even less—could be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.</p>\n<h3>Mixed oxide fuel</h3>\n<div>Main article: Nuclear reprocessing</div>\n<p>Spent nuclear fuel from normal light water reactors contains plutonium, but it is a mixture of plutonium-242, 240, 239 and 238. The mixture is not sufficiently enriched for efficient nuclear weapons, but can be used once as MOX fuel. Accidental neutron capture causes the amount of plutonium-242 and 240 to grow each time the plutonium is irradiated in a reactor with low-speed \"thermal\" neutrons, so that after the second cycle, the plutonium can only be consumed by fast neutron reactors. If fast neutron reactors are not available (the normal case), excess plutonium is usually discarded, and forms the longest-lived component of nuclear waste. The desire to consume this plutonium and other transuranic fuels and reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste is the usual reason nuclear engineers give to make fast neutron reactors.</p>\n<p>The most common chemical process, PUREX (<i>P</i>lutonium–<i>UR</i>anium <i>EX</i>traction) reprocesses spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium and uranium which can be used to form a mixed oxide \"MOX fuel\" for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60&nbsp;kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.</p>\n<p>MOX fuel has been in use since the 1980s and is widely used in Europe. In September 2000, the United States and the Russian Federation signed a Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34&nbsp;tonnes of weapon grade plutonium. The U.S. Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34&nbsp;tonnes of weapon grade plutonium in the United States before the end of 2019 by converting the plutonium to a MOX fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors.</p>\n<p>MOX fuel improves total burnup. A fuel rod is reprocessed after three years of use to remove waste products, which by then account for 3% of the total weight of the rods. Any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production. The presence of up to 1% gallium per mass in weapon grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long-term operation of a light water reactor.</p>\n<p>Plutonium recovered from spent reactor fuel poses a less significant proliferation hazard, because of excessive contamination with non-fissile plutonium-240 and plutonium-242. Separation of the isotopes is not feasible. A dedicated reactor operating on very low burnup (hence minimal exposure of newly formed Pu-239 to additional neutrons which causes it to be transformed to heavier isotopes of plutonium) is generally required to produce material suitable for use in efficient nuclear weapons. While 'weapons-grade' plutonium is defined to contain at least 92% plutonium-239 (of the total plutonium), the United States have managed to detonate an under-20Kt device using plutonium believed to contain only about 85% plutonium-239, so called 'fuel-grade' plutonium. The 'reactor grade' plutonium produced by a regular LWR burnup cycle typically contains less than 60% Pu-239, with up to 30% parasitic Pu-240/Pu-242, and 10–15% fissile Pu-241. It's unknown if a device using plutonium obtained from reprocessed civil nuclear waste can be detonated, however such a device could hypothetically fizzle and spread radioactive materials over a large urban area. The IAEA conservatively classifies plutonium of all isotopic vectors as \"direct-use\" material, that is, \"nuclear material that can be used for the manufacture of nuclear explosives components without transmutation or further enrichment\".</p>\n<p>Am has recently been suggested for use as a denaturing agent in plutonium reactor fuel rods to further limit its proliferation potential.</p>\n<h3>Power and heat source</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA glowing cylinder of PuO</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The isotope plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.74&nbsp;years. It emits a large amount of thermal energy with low levels of both gamma rays/particles and spontaneous neutron rays/particles. Being an alpha emitter, it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding. A sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium-238. One kilogram of the isotope can generate about 570 watts of heat.</p>\n<p>These characteristics make it well-suited for electrical power generation for devices which must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime. It is therefore used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators and radioisotope heater units such as those in the Cassini, Voyager, and New Horizons space probes.</p>\n<p>The twin Voyager spacecraft were launched in 1977 with each containing a 500 watt plutonium power source. Over 30 years later each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft. An earlier version of the same technology powered five Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages, starting with Apollo 12 in 1969.</p>\n<p>Plutonium-238 has also been used successfully to power artificial heart pacemakers, to reduce the risk of repeated surgery. It has been largely replaced by lithium-based primary cells, but as of 2003 there were somewhere between 50 and 100 plutonium-powered pacemakers still implanted and functioning in living patients. Plutonium-238 was studied as a way to provide supplemental heat to scuba diving. Plutonium-238 mixed with beryllium is used to generate neutrons for research purposes.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<div>See also: Plutonium in the environment</div>\n<h3>Toxicity</h3>\n<p>Isotopes and compounds of plutonium are radioactive and accumulate in bone marrow. Contamination by plutonium oxide has resulted from nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents, including military nuclear accidents where nuclear weapons have burned. Studies of the effects of these smaller releases, as well as of the widespread radiation poisoning sickness and death following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, have provided considerable information regarding the dangers, symptoms and prognosis of radiation poisoning, which in the case of the Japanese Hibakusha/survivors was largely unrelated to direct plutonium exposure.</p>\n<p>During the decay of plutonium, three types of radiation are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot go all the way through the body. Gamma radiation can go all the way through the body. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases with the amount of exposure.</p>\n<p>Even though alpha radiation cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs. The skeleton, where plutonium is absorbed, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly.</p>\n<p>Plutonium is more dangerous when inhaled than when ingested. The risk of lung cancer increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 mSv. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles, each about 3&nbsp;microns wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and death; no human is known to have died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies. The inhalation hazard is about 23,000 times greater than that of weapons-grade uranium, the ingestion hazard about 130,000 times greater.</p>\n<p>The \"hot particle\" theory in which a particle of plutonium dust radiates a localized spot of lung tissue has been tested and found false—such particles are more mobile than originally thought and toxicity is not measurably increased due to particulate form.</p>\n<p>When inhaled, plutonium can pass into the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, plutonium moves throughout the body and into the bones, liver, or other body organs. Plutonium that reaches body organs generally stays in the body for decades and continues to expose the surrounding tissue to radiation and thus may cause cancer.</p>\n<p>A commonly cited quote by Ralph Nader, states that a pound of plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere would be enough to kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas.</p>\n<p>Several populations of people who have been exposed to plutonium dust (e.g. people living down-wind of Nevada test sites, Nagasaki survivors, nuclear facility workers, and \"terminally ill\" patients injected with Pu in 1945–46 to study Pu metabolism) have been carefully followed and analyzed. These studies generally do not show especially high plutonium toxicity or plutonium-induced cancer results, such as Albert Stevens who survived into old age after being injected with plutonium. \"There were about 25 workers from Los Alamos National Laboratory who inhaled a considerable amount of plutonium dust during 1940s; according to the hot-particle theory, each of them has a 99.5% chance of being dead from lung cancer by now, but there has not been a single lung cancer among them.\"</p>\n<p>Plutonium has a metallic taste.</p>\n<h3>Criticality potential</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA sphere of simulated plutonium surrounded by neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide blocks in a re-enactment of Harry Daghlian's 1945 experiment</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Toxicity issues aside, care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235. A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.</p>\n<p>Criticality accidents have occurred in the past, some of them with lethal consequences. Careless handling of tungsten carbide bricks around a 6.2&nbsp;kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at Los Alamos on August 21, 1945, when scientist Harry K. Daghlian, Jr. received a dose estimated to be 5.1&nbsp;Sievert (510&nbsp;rems) and died 25&nbsp;days later. Nine months later, another Los Alamos scientist, Louis Slotin, died from a similar accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core (the so-called \"demon core\") that had previously claimed the life of Daghlian. These incidents were fictionalized in the 1989 film <i>Fat Man and Little Boy</i>.</p>\n<p>In December 1958, during a process of purifying plutonium at Los Alamos, a critical mass was formed in a mixing vessel, which resulted in the death of a chemical operator named Cecil Kelley. Other nuclear accidents have occurred in the Soviet Union, Japan, the United States, and many other countries.</p>\n<h3>Flammability</h3>\n<p>Metallic plutonium is a fire hazard, especially if the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand is probably the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.</p>\n<h2>Transportation</h2>\n<h3>Air</h3>\n\n<p>The U.S. Government air transport regulations permit the transport of plutonium by air, subject to restrictions on other dangerous materials carried on the same flight, packaging requirements, and stowage in the rearmost part of the aircraft.</p>\n<p>In 2012 media revealed that plutonium has been flown out of Norway on commercial passenger airlines—around every other year—including one time in 2011. Regulations permit an airplane to transport 15 grams of fissionable material. Such plutonium transportation is without problems, according to a Senior Advisor (<i>seniorrådgiver</i>) at Statens strålevern.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nuclear engineering</li>\n<li>Nuclear fuel cycle</li>\n<li>Nuclear physics</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<h3>Footnotes</h3>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ The PuO+\n2 ion is unstable in solution and will disproportionate into Pu and PuO2+\n2; the Pu will then oxidize the remaining PuO+\n2 to PuO2+\n2, being reduced in turn to Pu. Thus, aqueous solutions of PuO+\n2 tend over time towards a mixture of Pu and PuO2+\n2. UO+\n2 is unstable for the same reason.\n<dl>\n<dd>Crooks, William J.

  "title": "Americium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Americium</b> (/ˌæməˈrɪsiəm/ AM-ə-RIS-ee-əm) is a transuranic radioactive chemical element that has the symbol <b>Am</b> and atomic number 95. This transuranic element of the actinide series is located in the periodic table below the lanthanide element europium, and thus by analogy was named after another continent, America.</p>\n<p>Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley. Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100&nbsp;grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors, as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as a nuclear battery or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope Am, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.</p>\n<p>Americium is a relatively soft radioactive metal with silvery appearance. Its most common isotopes are Am and Am. In chemical compounds, they usually assume the oxidation state +3, especially in solutions. Several other oxidation states are known, which range from +2 to +7 and can be identified by their characteristic optical absorption spectra. The crystal lattice of solid americium and its compounds contains intrinsic defects, which are induced by self-irradiation with alpha particles and accumulate with time; this results in a drift of some material properties.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe triangle in the glass tube contains the first sample of americium (as the hydroxide), produced in 1944.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Although americium was likely produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in late autumn 1944, at the University of California, Berkeley by Glenn T. Seaborg, Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso. They used a 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. The element was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory) of the University of Chicago. Following the lighter neptunium, plutonium, and heavier curium, americium was the fourth transuranium element to be discovered. At the time, the periodic table had been restructured by Seaborg to its present layout, containing the actinide row below the lanthanide one. This led to americium being located right below its twin lanthanide element europium; it was thus by analogy named after another continent, America: \"The name americium (after the Americas) and the symbol Am are suggested for the element on the basis of its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare-earth series, analogous to europium, Eu, of the lanthanide series.\"</p>\n<p>The new element was isolated from its oxides in a complex, multi-step process. First plutonium-239 nitrate (PuNO) solution was coated on a platinum foil of about 0.5&nbsp;cm area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide (PuO) by annealing. After cyclotron irradiation, the coating was dissolved with nitric acid, and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution. The residue was dissolved in perchloric acid. Further separation was carried out by ion exchange, yielding a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that those elements were initially called by the Berkeley group as <i>pandemonium</i> (from Greek for <i>all demons</i> or <i>hell</i>) and <i>delirium</i> (from Latin for <i>madness</i>).</p>\n<p>Initial experiments yielded four americium isotopes: Am, Am, Am and Am. Americium-241 was directly obtained from plutonium upon absorption of one neutron. It decays by emission of a α-particle to Np; the half-life of this decay was first determined as 510 ± 20 years but then corrected to 432.2 years.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><small>The times are half-lives</small></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The second isotope Am was produced upon neutron bombardment of the already-created Am. Upon rapid β-decay, Am converts into the isotope of curium Cm (which had been discovered previously). The half-life of this decay was initially determined at 17 hours, which was close to the presently accepted value of 16.02 h.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The discovery of americium and curium in 1944 was closely related to the Manhattan Project; the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the Quiz Kids, five days before the official presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting on 11 November 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war. After the discovery of americium isotopes Am and Am, their production and compounds were patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor. The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity. The first substantial amounts of metallic americium weighing 40–200 micrograms were not prepared until 1951 by reduction of americium(III) fluoride with barium metal in high vacuum at 1100&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>See also: Nuclear reprocessing</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAmericium was detected in the fallout from the <i>Ivy Mike</i> nuclear test.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The longest-lived and most common isotopes of americium, Am and Am, have half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370 years, respectively. Therefore, all primordial americium (americium that was present on Earth during its formation) should have decayed by now.</p>\n<p>Existing americium is concentrated in the areas used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. For example, the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), revealed high concentrations of various actinides including americium; due to military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956. Trinitite, the glassy residue left on the desert floor near Alamogordo, New Mexico, after the plutonium-based Trinity nuclear bomb test on 16 July 1945, contains traces of americium-241. Elevated levels of americium were also detected at the crash site of a US B-52 bomber, which carried four hydrogen bombs, in 1968 in Greenland.</p>\n<p>In other regions, the average radioactivity of surface soil due to residual americium is only about 0.01&nbsp;picocuries/g (0.37&nbsp;mBq/g). Atmospheric americium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 1,900 higher concentration of americium inside sandy soil particles than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in loam soils.</p>\n<p>Americium is produced mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100&nbsp;grams of various americium isotopes, mostly Am and Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, have to be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, but it is still being developed for americium.</p>\n<p>A few atoms of americium can be produced by neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly concentrated uranium-bearing deposits.</p>\n<h2>Synthesis and extraction</h2>\n<h3>Isotope nucleosyntheses</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChromatographic elution curves revealing the similarity between the lanthanides Tb, Gd, and Eu and the corresponding actinides Bk, Cm, and Am.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Americium has been produced in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades, and kilograms of its Am and Am isotopes have been accumulated by now. Nevertheless, since it was first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 USD per gram of Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure. The heavier isotope Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate, resulting in a higher cost of the order 100–160 USD/mg.</p>\n<p>Americium is not synthesized directly from uranium – the most common reactor material – but from the plutonium isotope Pu. The latter needs to be produced first, according to the following nuclear process:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The capture of two neutrons by Pu (a so-called (n,γ) reaction), followed by a β-decay, results in Am:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel contains about 12% of Pu. Because it spontaneously converts to Am, Pu can be extracted and may be used to generate further Am. However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of Pu decays to Am after about 15 years, and the Am amount reaches a maximum after 70 years.</p>\n<p>The obtained Am can be used for generating heavier americium isotopes by further neutron capture inside a nuclear reactor. In a light water reactor (LWR), 79% of Am converts to Am and 10% to its nuclear isomer Am:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>79%:&nbsp;&nbsp; </dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>10%:&nbsp;&nbsp; </dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Americium-242 has a half-life of only 16 hours, which makes its further up-conversion to Am, extremely inefficient. The latter isotope is produced instead in a process where Pu captures four neutrons under high neutron flux:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Metal generation</h3>\n<p>Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes in oxide forms, from which isotopes of americium need to be separated. In a typical procedure, the spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) is dissolved in nitric acid, and the bulk of uranium and plutonium is removed using a PUREX-type extraction (<b>P</b>lutonium –<b>UR</b>anium <b>EX</b>traction) with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction, to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Americium compounds are then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. A large amount of work has been done on the solvent extraction of americium. For example, a recent EU funded project codenamed \"EUROPART\" studied triazines and other compounds as potential extraction agents. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent as highly selective to americium (and curium). Separation of americium from the highly similar curium can be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone, at elevated temperatures. Both Am and Cm are mostly present in solutions in the +3 valence state; whereas curium remains unchanged, americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes which can be washed away.</p>\n<p>Metallic americium is obtained by reduction from its compounds. Americium(III) fluoride was first used for this purpose. The reaction was conducted using elemental barium as reducing agent in a water- and oxygen-free environment inside an apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>An alternative is the reduction of americium dioxide by metallic lanthanum or thorium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Physical properties</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDouble-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC in the crystal structure of α-americium (A: green, B: blue, C: red).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In the periodic table, americium is located to the right of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide europium, with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12&nbsp;g/cm, americium is lighter than both curium (13.52&nbsp;g/cm) and plutonium (19.8&nbsp;g/cm); but is heavier than europium (5.264&nbsp;g/cm)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173&nbsp;°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639&nbsp;°C) and europium (826&nbsp;°C), but lower than for curium (1340&nbsp;°C).</p>\n<p>At ambient conditions, americium is present in its most stable α form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry, and a space group P6/mmc with lattice parameters <i>a</i>&nbsp;= 346.8&nbsp;pm and <i>c</i>&nbsp;= 1124&nbsp;pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (<i>fcc</i>) symmetry, space group Fm3m and lattice constant <i>a</i>&nbsp;= 489&nbsp;pm. This <i>fcc</i> structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770&nbsp;°C it changes into an <i>fcc</i> phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075&nbsp;°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium.</p>\n<p>As with many other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle irradiation is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium and some of its properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2&nbsp;µOhm·cm to 10&nbsp;µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16&nbsp;µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69&nbsp;µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior is similar to that of neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60&nbsp;K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.</p>\n<p>Americium is paramagnetic in a wide temperature range, from that of liquid helium, to room temperature, and above. This behavior is markedly different from that of its neighbor curium which exhibit antiferromagnetic transition at 52&nbsp;K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5&nbsp;± 0.2)×10/°C along the shorter <i>a</i> axis and (6.2&nbsp;± 0.4)×10/°C for the longer <i>c</i> hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6&nbsp;± 1.3&nbsp;kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (Δ<i>H</i>°) of aqueous Am ion is −621.2&nbsp;± 2.0&nbsp;kJ/mol. The standard potential Am/Am is 2.08 ± 0.01&nbsp;V.</p>\n<h2>Chemical properties</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAmericium ions in solution: Am (left) and Am (right). Am is colorless at low and reddish at higher concentrations.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Americium readily reacts with oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common oxidation state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation states have been observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am (yellow-reddish), AmO+\n2; (yellow), AmO2+\n2 (brown) and AmO5−\n6 (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811&nbsp;nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715&nbsp;nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992&nbsp;nm.</p>\n<p>Americium compounds with oxidation state +4 and higher are strong oxidizing agents, comparable in strength to the permanganate ion (MnO−\n4) in acidic solutions. Whereas the Am ions are unstable in solutions and readily convert to Am, the +4 oxidation state occurs well in solids, such as americium dioxide (AmO) and americium(IV) fluoride (AmF).</p>\n<p>All pentavalent and hexavalent americium compounds are complex salts such as KAmOF, LiAmO and LiAmO, BaAmO, AmOF. These high oxidation states Am(IV), Am(V) and Am(VI) can be prepared from Am(III) by oxidation with ammonium persulfate in dilute nitric acid, with silver(I) oxide in perchloric acid, or with ozone or sodium persulfate in sodium carbonate solutions. The pentavalent oxidation state of americium was first observed in 1951. It is present in aqueous solution in the form of AmO+\n2 ions (acidic) or AmO−\n3 ions (alkaline) which are however unstable and subject to several rapid disproportionation reactions:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Chemical compounds</h2>\n<h3>Oxygen compounds</h3>\n<p>Two americium oxides are known, with the oxidation states +3 (AmO) and +4 (AmO). Americium(III) oxide is a red-brown solid with a melting point of 2205&nbsp;°C. Americium(IV) oxide is the main form of solid americium which is used in nearly all its applications. As most other actinide dioxides, it is a black solid with a cubic (fluorite) crystal structure.</p>\n<p>The oxalate of americium(III), vacuum dried at room temperature, has the chemical formula Am(CO)·7HO. Upon heating in vacuum, it loses water at 240&nbsp;°C and starts decomposing into AmO at 300&nbsp;°C, the decomposition completes at about 470&nbsp;°C. The initial oxalate dissolves in nitric acid with the maximum solubility of 0.25&nbsp;g/L.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<p>Halides of americium are known for the oxidation states +2, +3 and +4, where the +3 is most stable, especially in solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Reduction of Am(III) compounds with sodium amalgam yields Am(II) salts – the black halides AmCl, AmBr and AmI. They are very sensitive to oxygen and oxidize in water, releasing hydrogen and converting back to the Am(III) state. Specific lattice constants are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Orthorhombic AmCl: <i>a</i> = 896.3 ± 0.8 pm, <i>b</i> = 757.3 ± 0.8 pm and <i>c</i> = 453.2 ± 0.6 pm</li>\n<li>Tetragonal AmBr: <i>a</i> = 1159.2 ± 0.4 and <i>c</i> = 712.1 ± 0.3 pm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They can also be prepared by reacting metallic americium with an appropriate mercury halide HgX, where X = Cl, Br or I:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Americium(III) fluoride (AmF) is poorly soluble and precipitates upon reaction of Am and fluoride ions in weak acidic solutions:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The tetravalent americium(IV) fluoride (AmF) is obtained by reacting solid americium(III) fluoride with molecular fluorine:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Another known form of solid tetravalent americium chloride is KAmF. Tetravalent americium has also been observed in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, black Am(OH) was dissolved in 15-M NHF with the americium concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum which is similar to that of AmF but differed from other oxidation states of americium. Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90&nbsp;°C did not result in its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles.</p>\n<p>Most americium(III) halides form hexagonal crystals with slight variation of the color and exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl) is reddish and has a structure isotypic to uranium(III) chloride (space group P6/m) and the melting point of 715&nbsp;°C. The fluoride is isotypic to LaF (space group P6/mmc) and the iodide to BiI (space group R3). The bromide is an exception with the orthorhombic PuBr-type structure and space group Cmcm. Crystals of americium hexahydrate (AmCl·6HO) can be prepared by dissolving americium dioxide in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the liquid. Those crystals are hygroscopic and have yellow-reddish color and a monoclinic crystal structure.</p>\n<p>Oxyhalides of americium in the form AmOX, AmOX, AmOX and AmOX can be obtained by reacting the corresponding americium halide with oxygen or SbO, and AmOCl can also be produced by vapor phase hydrolysis:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Chalcogenides and pnictides</h3>\n<p>The known chalcogenides of americium include the sulfide AmS, selenides AmSe and AmSe, and tellurides AmTe and AmTe. The pnictides of americium (Am) of the AmX type are known for the elements phosphorus, arsenic, antimony and bismuth. They crystallize in the rock-salt lattice.</p>\n<h3>Silicides and borides</h3>\n<p>Americium monosilicide (AmSi) and \"disilicide\" (nominally AmSi with: 1.87 &lt; x &lt; 2.0) were obtained by reduction of americium(III) fluoride with elementary silicon in vacuum at 1050&nbsp;°C (AmSi) and 1150−1200&nbsp;°C (AmSi). AmSi is a black solid isomorphic with LaSi, it has an orthorhombic crystal symmetry. AmSi has a bright silvery lustre and a tetragonal crystal lattice (space group <i>I</i>4/amd), it is isomorphic with PuSi and ThSi. Borides of americium include AmB and AmB. The tetraboride can be obtained by heating an oxide or halide of americium with magnesium diboride in vacuum or inert atmosphere.</p>\n<h3>Organoamericium compounds</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n(η-CH)Am structure</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Analogous to uranocene, americium forms an organometallic compound with two cyclooctatetraene ligands, that is (η-CH)Am. It also makes trigonal (η-CH)Am complexes with three cyclopentadienyl rings.</p>\n<p>Formation of the complexes of the type Am(n-CH-BTP), where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-CH-BTP and Am ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with americium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides.</p>\n<h2>Biological aspects</h2>\n<p>Americium is an artificial element, and thus a biological function involving the element, like all elements heavier than tungsten, would be impossible. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus <i>Citrobacter</i> precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria and fungi.</p>\n<h2>Fission</h2>\n<p>The isotope Am (half-life 141 years) has the largest cross sections for absorption of thermal neutrons (5,700 barns), that results in a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. The critical mass for a bare Am sphere is about 9–14&nbsp;kg (the uncertainty results from insufficient knowledge of its material properties). It can be lowered to 3–5&nbsp;kg with a metal reflector and should become even smaller with a water reflector. Such small critical mass is favorable for portable nuclear weapons, but those based on Am are not known yet, probably because of its scarcity and high price. The critical masses of two other readily available isotopes, Am and Am, are relatively high – 57.6 to 75.6&nbsp;kg for Am and 209&nbsp;kg for Am. Scarcity and high price yet hinder application of americium as a nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors.</p>\n<p>There are proposals of very compact 10-kW high-flux reactors using as little as 20&nbsp;grams of Am. Such low-power reactors would be relatively safe to use as neutron sources for radiation therapy in hospitals.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>See also: Isotopes of americium</div>\n<p>About 19 isotopes and 8 nuclear isomers are known for americium. There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, Am and Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370&nbsp;years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer Am has a long half-life of 141&nbsp;years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64&nbsp;microseconds for Am to 50.8&nbsp;hours for Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass.</p>\n<p>Americium-241 decays to Np emitting alpha particles of 5 different energies, mostly at 5.486&nbsp;MeV (85.2%) and 5.443&nbsp;MeV (12.8%). Because many of the resulting states are metastable, they also emit gamma rays with the discrete energies between 26.3 and 158.5&nbsp;keV.</p>\n<p>Americium-242 is a short-lived isotope with a half-life of 16.02&nbsp;h. It mostly (82.7%) converts by β-decay to Cm, but also by electron capture to Pu (17.3%). Both Cm and Pu transform via nearly the same decay chain through Pu down to U.</p>\n<p>Nearly all (99.541%) of Am decays by internal conversion to Am and the remaining 0.459% by α-decay to Np. The latter breaks down to Pu and then to U.</p>\n<p>Americium-243 transforms by α-emission into Np, which converts by β-decay to Pu, and the Pu changes into U by emitting an α-particle.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Outside and inside view of an americium-based smoke detector</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Ionization detectors</h3>\n<div>Main article: Americium smoke detector</div>\n<p>Americium is the only synthetic element to have found its way into the household, where one common type of smoke detector uses Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of ionizing radiation. This isotope is preferred against Ra because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little of harmful γ-radiation. The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1&nbsp;microcurie (37&nbsp;kBq) or 0.28 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.</p>\n<h3>Radionuclide</h3>\n<p>As Am has a significantly longer half-life than Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), it has been proposed as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, for example in spacecraft. Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7&nbsp;mW/g for Am and 6.31&nbsp;mW/g for Am (cf. 390&nbsp;mW/g for Pu) – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the European Space Agency is planning to use americium for its space probes.</p>\n<p>Another proposed space-related application of americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It relies on the very high rate of nuclear fission of Am, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of Am can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.</p>\n<p>One more proposal which utilizes the high nuclear fission rate of Am is a nuclear battery. Its design relies not on the energy of the emitted by americium alpha particles, but on their charge, that is the americium acts as the self-sustaining \"cathode\". A single 3.2&nbsp;kg Am charge of such battery could provide about 140&nbsp;kW of power over a period of 80 days. With all the potential benefits, the current applications of Am are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.</p>\n<h3>Neutron source</h3>\n<p>The oxide of Am pressed with beryllium is an efficient neutron source. Here americium acts as the alpha source, and beryllium produces neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The most widespread use of AmBe neutron sources is a neutron probe – a device used to measure the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. Am neutron sources are also used in well logging applications, as well as in neutron radiography, tomography and other radiochemical investigations.</p>\n<h3>Production of other elements</h3>\n<p>Americium is a starting material for the production of other transuranic elements and transactinides – for example, 82.7% of Am decays to Cm and 17.3% to Pu. In the nuclear reactor, Am is also up-converted by neutron capture to Am and Am, which transforms by β-decay to Cm:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Irradiation of Am by C or Ne ions yields the isotopes Es (einsteinium) or Db (dubnium), respectively. Furthermore, the element berkelium (Bk isotope) had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding Am with alpha particles, in 1949, by the same Berkeley group, using the same 60-inch cyclotron. Similarly, nobelium was produced at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included irradiation of Am with N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for lawrencium, discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of Am with O.</p>\n<h3>Spectrometer</h3>\n<p>Americium-241 has been used as a portable source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 60-keV gamma ray emissions from Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed nuclear density gauges and nuclear densometers. For example, the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity). Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.</p>\n<h2>Health issues</h2>\n<p>As a highly radioactive element, americium and its compounds must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth.</p>\n<p>If consumed, americium is excreted within a few days and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, roughly 45% of it goes to the liver and 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. The uptake to the liver depends on the individual and increases with age. In the bones, americium is first deposited over cortical and trabecular surfaces and slowly redistributes over the bone with time. The biological half-life of Am is 50 years in the bones and 20 years in the liver, whereas in the gonads (testicles and ovaries) it remains permanently; in all these organs, americium promotes formation of cancer cells as a result of its radioactivity.</p>\n<p>Americium often enters landfills from discarded smoke detectors. The rules associated with the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In the U.S., the \"Radioactive Boy Scout\" David Hahn was able to concentrate americium from smoke detectors after managing to buy a hundred of them at remainder prices and also stealing a few. There have been cases of humans being contaminated with americium, the worst case being that of Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 as a result of an explosion in his lab. McCluskey died at the age of 75, not as a result of exposure, but of a heart disease which he had before the accident.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Actinides in the environment</li>\n<li>Category:Americium compounds</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ The \"metastable\" state is marked by the letter m.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^    Muller, W.; Schenkel, R.; Schmidt, H.

  "title": "Curium",
  "html": "<div>This article is about the chemical element.  For the ancient city located in Cyprus, see Kourion.</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Curium</b> is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with the symbol <b>Cm</b> and atomic number 96. This element of the actinide series was named after Marie Skłodowska-Curie and Pierre Curie – both were known for their research on radioactivity. Curium was first intentionally produced and identified in July 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most curium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 20&nbsp;grams of curium.</p>\n<p>Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a relatively high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is paramagnetic at ambient conditions, it becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits valence +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly fluorescent complexes with various organic compounds, but there is no evidence of its incorporation into bacteria and archaea. When introduced into the human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where it promotes cancer.</p>\n<p>All known isotopes of curium are radioactive and have a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, and the heat released in this process can potentially produce electricity in radioisotope thermoelectric generators. This application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on the Sojourner, Mars, Mars 96, Athena, Spirit and Opportunity rovers as well as the Mars Science Laboratory to analyze the composition and structure of the rocks on the surface of Mars and the Moon. Such a spectrometer will also be used by the Philae lander of the Rosetta spacecraft to probe the surface of the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGlenn T. Seaborg</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe 60-inch (150&nbsp;cm) cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Although curium had likely been produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in 1944, at the University of California, Berkeley by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso. In their experiments, they used a 60-inch (150&nbsp;cm) cyclotron.</p>\n<p>Curium was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory) at the University of Chicago. It was the third transuranium element to be discovered even though it is the fourth in the series – the lighter element americium was unknown at the time.</p>\n<p>The sample was prepared as follows: first plutonium nitrate solution was coated on a platinum foil of about 0.5&nbsp;cm area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide (PuO) by annealing. Following cyclotron irradiation of the oxide, the coating was dissolved with nitric acid and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution. The residue was dissolved in perchloric acid, and further separation was carried out by ion exchange to yield a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that the Berkeley group initially called those elements <i>pandemonium</i> (from Greek for <i>all demons</i> or <i>hell</i>) and <i>delirium</i> (from Latin for <i>madness</i>).</p>\n<p>The curium-242 isotope was produced in July–August 1944 by bombarding Pu with α-particles to produce curium with the release of a neutron:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Curium-242 was unambiguously identified by the characteristic energy of the α-particles emitted during the decay:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The half-life of this alpha decay was first measured as 150 days and then corrected to 162.8 days.</p>\n<p>Another isotope Cm was produced in a similar reaction in March 1945:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The half-life of the Cm α-decay was correctly determined as 26.7 days.</p>\n<p>The discovery of curium, as well as americium, in 1944 was closely related to the Manhattan Project, the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the Quiz Kids, five days before the official presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting on November 11, 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war. The discovery of curium (Cm and Cm), their production and compounds were later patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The new element was named after Marie Skłodowska-Curie and her husband Pierre Curie who are noted for discovering radium and for their work in radioactivity. It followed the example of gadolinium, a lanthanide element above curium in the periodic table, which was named after the explorer of the rare earth elements Johan Gadolin:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>\"As the name for the element of atomic number 96 we should like to propose \"curium\" , with symbol Cm. The evidence indicates that element 96 contains seven 5f electrons and is thus analogous to the element gadolinium with its seven 4f electrons in the regular rare earth series. On this base element 96 is named after the Curies in a manner analogous to the naming of gadolinium, in which the chemist Gadolin was honored.\"</i></dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The first curium samples were barely visible, and were identified by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and Isadore Perlman created the first substantial sample of 30&nbsp;µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding americium-241 with neutrons. Macroscopic amounts of curium fluoride were obtained in 1950 by W. W. T. Crane, J. C. Wallmann and B. B. Cunningham. Its magnetic susceptibility was very close to that of GdF providing the first experimental evidence for the +3 valence of curium in its compounds. Curium metal was produced only in 1951 by reduction of curium fluoride with barium.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDouble-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC in the crystal structure of α-curium (A: green, B: blue, C: red)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nOrange fluorescence of Cm ions in a solution of tris(hydrotris)pyrazolylborato-Cm(III) complex, excited at 396.6 nm.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A synthetic, radioactive element, curium is a hard dense metal with silvery-white appearance and physical and chemical properties resembling those of gadolinium. Its melting point of 1340 °C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637 °C), plutonium (639 °C) and americium (1173 °C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312 °C. The boiling point of curium is 3110 °C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P6/mmc, lattice parameters <i>a</i> = 365 pm and <i>c</i> = 1182 pm, and four formula units per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum. At pressures above 23 GPa, at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a face-centered cubic symmetry, space group Fm3m and the lattice constant <i>a</i> = 493 pm. Upon further compression to 43 GPa, curium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa. These three curium phases are also referred to as Cm I, II and III.</p>\n<p>Curium has peculiar magnetic properties. Whereas its neighbor element actinium shows no deviation from Curie-Weiss paramagnetism in the entire temperature range, α-Cm transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 65–52 K, and β-Cm exhibits a ferrimagnetic transition at about 205 K. Meanwhile, curium pnictides show ferromagnetic transitions upon cooling: CmN and CmAs at 109 K, CmP at 73 K and CmSb at 162 K. Similarly, the lanthanide analogue of curium, gadolinium, as well as its pnictides also show magnetic transitions upon cooling, but the transition character is somewhat different: Gd and GdN become ferromagnetic, and GdP, GdAs and GdSb show antiferromagnetic ordering.</p>\n<p>In accordance with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There is a significant increase in resistvity over time (about 10 µOhm·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium is similar to that of gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, polonium and thorium.</p>\n<p>Under ultraviolet illumination, curium(III) ions exhibit strong and stable yellow-orange fluorescence with a maximum in the range about 590–640&nbsp;nm depending on their environment. The fluorescence originates from the transitions from the first excited state D and the ground state S. Analysis of this fluorescence allows monitoring interactions between Cm(III) ions in organic and inorganic complexes.</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<p>Curium ions in solution assume the oxidation state of +3, which is the most stable oxidation state for curium. The +4 oxidation state is observed only in a few solid phases, such as CmO and CmF. Chemical behavior of curium is different from actinides thorium and uranium, and is similar to that of americium and many lanthanides. In aqueous solution, the Cm ion is colorless to pale green, and Cm ion is pale yellow. The optical absorption of Cm ions contains three sharp peaks at 375.4, 381.2 and 396.5 nanometers and their strength can be directly converted into the concentration of the ions. Curium ions are hard Lewis acids and thus form most stable complexes with hard bases. The bonding is mostly ionic, with a small covalent component. Curium in its complexes commonly exhibits a 9-fold coordination environment, within a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n<div>See also: Isotopes of curium</div>\n<p>About 20 radioisotopes and 7 nuclear isomers between Cm and Cm are known for curium, and no stable isotopes. The longest half-lives have been reported for Cm (15.6 million years) and Cm (348,000 years). Other long-lived isotopes are Cm (half-life 8500 years), Cm (8,300 years) and Cm (4,760 years). Curium-250 is unusual by that it predominantly (about 86%) decays via spontaneous fission. The most commonly used curium isotopes are Cm and Cm with the half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, respectively.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nTransmutation flow between Pu and Cm in LWR.<br>\nFission percentage is 100 minus shown percentages.<br>\nTotal rate of transmutation varies greatly by nuclide.<br>\nCm–Cm are long-lived with negligible decay.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>All isotopes between Cm and Cm, as well as Cm, undergo a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle can act as a nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopesCm, Cm and Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.</p>\n<p>The table to the right lists the critical masses for curium isotopes for a sphere, without a moderator and reflector. With a metal reflector (30&nbsp;cm of steel), the critical masses of the odd isotopes are about 3–4&nbsp;kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30&nbsp;cm) as the reflector, the critical mass can be as small as 59&nbsp;gram for Cm, 155&nbsp;gram for Cm and 1550&nbsp;gram for Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these critical mass values. Whereas it is usually of the order 20%, the values for Cm and Cm were listed as large as 371&nbsp;kg and 70.1&nbsp;kg, respectively, by some research groups.</p>\n<p>Currently, curium is not used as a nuclear fuel owing to its low availability and high price. Cm and Cm have a very small critical mass and therefore could be used in portable nuclear weapons, but none have been reported thus far. Curium-243 is not suitable for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat. Curium-247 would be highly suitable, having a half-life 647 times that of plutonium-239.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSeveral isotopes of curium were detected in the fallout from the <i>Ivy Mike</i> nuclear test.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The longest-lived isotope of curium, Cm, has a half-life of 15.6 million years. Therefore, all primordial curium, that is curium present on the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now. Curium is produced artificially, in small quantities for research purposes. Furthermore, it occurs in spent nuclear fuel. Curium is present in nature in certain areas used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, which were conducted between 1945 and 1980. So the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), beside einsteinium, fermium, plutonium and americium also revealed isotopes of berkelium, californium and curium, in particular Cm, Cm and smaller quantities of Cm, Cm and Cm. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.</p>\n<p>Atmospheric curium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 4,000 times higher concentration of curium at the sandy soil particles than in water present in the soil pores. An even higher ratio of about 18,000 was measured in loam soils.</p>\n<p>A few atoms of curium can be produced by neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly concentrated uranium-bearing deposits.</p>\n<h2>Synthesis</h2>\n<h3>Isotope preparation</h3>\n<p>Curium is produced in small quantities in nuclear reactors, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the Cm and Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains the high price of curium, which has been be quoted at 160–185 USD per milligram, with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for Cm and 170 USD/g for Cm. In nuclear reactors, curium is formed from U in a series of nuclear reactions. In the first chain, U captures a neutron and converts into U, which via β decay transforms into Np and Pu.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd> <small>(the times are half-lives)</small>.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Further neutron capture followed by β-decay produces the Am isotope of americium which further converts into Cm:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>For research purposes, curium is obtained by irradiating not uranium but plutonium, which is available in large amounts from spent nuclear fuel. Much higher neutron flux is used for the irradiation that results in a different reaction chain and formation of Cm:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Curium-244 decays into Pu by emission of alpha particle, but it also absorbs neutrons resulting in a small amount of heavier curium isotopes. Among those, Cm and Cm are popular in scientific research because of their long half-lives. However, the production rate of Cm in thermal neutron reactors is relatively low because of it is prone to undergo fission induced by thermal neutrons. Synthesis of Cm via neutron absorption is also rather unlikely because of the short half-life of the intermediate product Cm (64 min), which converts by β decay to the berkelium isotope Bk.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd> <small>(for A = 244–248)</small></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The above cascade of (n,γ) reactions produces a mixture of different curium isotopes. Their post-synthesis separation is cumbersome, and therefore a selective synthesis is desired. Curium-248 is favored for research purposes because of its long half-life. The most efficient preparation method of this isotope is via α-decay of the californium isotope Cf, which is available in relatively large quantities due to its long half-life (2.65 years). About 35–50&nbsp;mg of Cm is being produced by this method every year. The associated reaction produces Cm with isotopic purity of 97%.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Another interesting for research isotope Cm can be obtained from the α-decay of Cf, and the latter isotope is produced in minute quantities from the β-decay of the berkelium isotope Bk.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Metal preparation</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChromatographic elution curves revealing the similarity between Tb, Gd, Eu lanthanides and corresponding Bk, Cm, Am actinides.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove the bulk of the uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (<b>P</b>lutonium – <b>UR</b>anium <b>EX</b>traction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.</p>\n<p>Metallic curium is obtained by reduction of its compounds. Initially, curium(III) fluoride was used for this purpose. The reaction was conducted in the environment free from water and oxygen, in the apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten, using elemental barium or lithium as reducing agents.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Another possibility is the reduction of curium(IV) oxide using a magnesium-zinc alloy in a melt of magnesium chloride and magnesium fluoride.</p>\n<h2>Compounds and reactions</h2>\n<div>See also category: Curium compounds</div>\n<h3>Oxides</h3>\n<p>Curium readily reacts with oxygen forming mostly CmO and CmO oxides, but the divalent oxide CmO is also known. Black CmO can be obtained by burning curium oxalate (Cm(CO)), nitrate (Cm(NO)) or hydroxide in pure oxygen. Upon heating to 600–650 °C in vacuum (about 0.01 Pa), it transforms into the whitish CmO:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Alternatively, CmO can be obtained by reducing CmO with molecular hydrogen:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Furthermore, a number of ternary oxides of the type M(II)CmO are known, where M stays for a divalent metal, such as barium.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<p>The colorless curium(III) fluoride (CmF) can be produced by introducing fluoride ions into curium(III)-containing solutions. The brown tetravalent curium(IV) fluoride (CmF) on the other hand is only obtained by reacting curium(III) fluoride with molecular fluorine:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>A series of ternary fluorides are known of the form ACmF, where A stands for alkali metal.</p>\n<p>The colorless curium(III) chloride (CmCl) is produced in the reaction of curium(III) hydroxide (Cm(OH)) with anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas. It can further be converted into other halides, such as curium(III) bromide (colorless to light green) and curium(III) iodide (colorless), by reacting it with the ammonia salt of the corresponding halide at elevated temperature of about 400–450 °C:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>An alternative procedure is heating curium oxide to about 600 °C with the corresponding acid (such as hydrobromic for curium bromide). Vapor phase hydrolysis of curium(III) chloride results in curium oxychloride:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Chalcogenides and pnictides</h3>\n<p>Sulfides, selenides and tellurides of curium have been obtained by treating curium with gaseous sulfur, selenium or tellurium in vacuum at elevated temperature. The pnictides of curium of the type CmX are known for the elements nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. They can be prepared by reacting either curium(III) hydride (CmH) or metallic curium with these elements at elevated temperatures.</p>\n<h3>Organocurium compounds and biological aspects</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nPredicted curocene structure</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Organometallic complexes analogous to uranocene are known also for other actinides, such as thorium, protactinium, neptunium, plutonium and americium. Molecular orbital theory predicts a stable \"curocene\" complex (η-CH)Cm, but it has not been reported experimentally yet.</p>\n<p>Formation of the complexes of the type Cm(n-CH-BTP), where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-CH-BTP and Cm ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with curium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. Dissolved Cm ions bind with many organic compounds, such as hydroxamic acid, urea, fluorescein and adenosine triphosphate. Many of these compounds are related to biological activity of various microorganisms. The resulting complexes exhibit strong yellow-orange emission under UV light excitation, which is convenient not only for their detection, but also for studying the interactions between the Cm ion and the ligands via changes in the half-life (of the order ~0.1 ms) and spectrum of the fluorescence.</p>\n<p>Curium has no biological significance. There are a few reports on biosorption of Cm by bacteria and archaea, however no evidence for incorporation of curium into them.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<h3>Radionuclides</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe radiation from curium is so strong that the metal glows purple in the dark.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Curium is one of the most radioactive isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes Cm and Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6 MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the Cm isotope, while Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. Curium-243 with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as Pu, Cm emits a 500 time greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2&nbsp;inches of lead for a 1&nbsp;kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for Pu. Therefore this application of curium is currently considered impractical.</p>\n<p>A more promising application of Cm is to produce Pu, a more suitable radioisotope for thermoelectric generators such as in cardiac pacemakers. The alternative routes to Pu use the (n,γ) reaction of Np, or the deuteron bombardment of uranium, which both always produce Pu as an undesired by-product — since the latter decays to Tl with strong gamma emission.</p>\n<p>Curium is also a common starting material for the production of higher transuranic elements and transactinides. Thus, bombardment of Cm with oxygen (O) or magnesium (Mg) yielded certain isotopes of seaborgium (Sg) and hassium (Hs and Hs). Californium was discovered when a microgram-sized target of curium-242 was irradiated with 35&nbsp;MeV alpha particles using the 60-inch (150&nbsp;cm) cyclotron at Berkeley:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>242\n96Cm + 4\n2He → 245\n98Cf + 1\n0n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nAlpha-particle X-ray spectrometer of a Mars exploration rover</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>X-ray spectrometer</h3>\n<p>The most practical application of Cm — though rather limited in total volume — is as α-particle source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers (APXS). These instruments were installed on the Sojourner, Mars, Mars 96, Spirit, Athena and Opportunity rovers, as well as the Mars Science Laboratory to analyze the composition and structure of the rocks on the surface of planet Mars. APXS was also used in the Surveyor 5–7 moon probes but with a Cm source.</p>\n<p>An elaborated APXS setup is equipped with a sensor head containing six curium sources having the total radioactive decay rate of several tens of millicuries (roughly a gigabecquerel). The sources are collimated on the sample, and the energy spectra of the alpha particles and protons scattered from the sample are analyzed (the proton analysis is implemented only in some spectrometers). These spectra contain quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium and lithium. An APXS will also be used by the Philae lander of the Rosetta spacecraft to probe the surface of the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet.</p>\n<h2>Safety</h2>\n<p>Owing to its high radioactivity, curium and its compounds must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas curium itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection. If consumed, curium is excreted within a few days and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, about 45% goes to the liver, 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, curium accumulates on the inside of the interfaces to the bone marrow and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys bone marrow and thus stops red blood cell creation. The biological half-life of curium is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones. Curium is absorbed in the body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μC. Intravenous injection of Cm and Cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of bone tumor, and inhalation promoted pulmonary and liver cancer.</p>\n<p>Curium isotopes are inevitably present in spent nuclear fuel with a concentration of about 20 g/tonne. Among them, the Cm–Cm isotopes have decay times of thousands of years and need to be removed to neutralize the fuel for disposal. The associated procedure involves several steps, where curium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure, nuclear transmutation, while well documented for other elements, is still being developed for curium.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^    Schenkel, R (1977). \"The electrical resistivity of 244Cm metal\".

  "title": "Berkelium",
  "html": "<div>\"Bk\" redirects here. For other uses, see BK (disambiguation).</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Berkelium</b> is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with the symbol <b>Bk</b> and atomic number 97, a member of the actinide and transuranium element series. It is named after the city of Berkeley, California, the location of the University of California Radiation Laboratory where it was discovered in December 1949. This was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium, plutonium, curium and americium.</p>\n<p>The major isotope of berkelium, berkelium-249, is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux nuclear reactors, mainly at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, and at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, Russia. The production of the second-important isotope berkelium-247 involves the irradiation of the rare isotope curium-244 with high-energy alpha particles.</p>\n<p>Just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside of scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides. A 22&nbsp;milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the element ununseptium for the first time in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was bombarded with calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This was a culmination of the Russia–US collaboration on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118.</p>\n<p>Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy electrons and thus is relatively safe to handle. However, it decays with a half-life of 330&nbsp;days to californium-249, which is a strong and hazardous emitter of alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also self-radiation damage, and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDouble-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC in the crystal structure of α-berkelium (A: green, B: blue, C: red)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive actinide metal. In the periodic table, it is located to the right of the actinide curium, to the left of the actinide californium and below the lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78&nbsp;g/cm lies between those of curium (13.52&nbsp;g/cm) and californium (15.1&nbsp;g/cm), as does its melting point of 986&nbsp;°C, below that of curium (1340&nbsp;°C) but higher than that of californium (900&nbsp;°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2×10Pa).</p>\n<p>Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp fluorescence peaks at 652&nbsp;nanometers (red light) and 742&nbsp;nanometers (deep red – near infrared) due to internal transitions at the f-electron shell. The relative intensity of these peaks depends on the excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide.</p>\n<p>Between 70&nbsp;K and room temperature, berkelium behaves as a Curie–Weiss paramagnetic material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69&nbsp;Bohr magnetons (µ) and a Curie temperature of 101&nbsp;K. This magnetic moment is almost equal to the theoretical value of 9.72&nbsp;µ calculated within the simple atomic L-S coupling model. Upon cooling to about 34&nbsp;K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state. Enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −600&nbsp;kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (Δ<i>H</i>°) of aqueous Bk ions is obtained as −601&nbsp;kJ/mol. The standard potential Bk/Bk is −2.01&nbsp;V. The ionization potential of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23&nbsp;eV.</p>\n<h3>Allotropes</h3>\n<p>At ambient conditions, berkelium assumes its most stable α form which has a hexagonal symmetry, space group <i>P6/mmc</i>, lattice parameters of 341&nbsp;pm and 1107&nbsp;pm. The crystal has a double-hexagonal close packing structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic (having a similar structure) with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium. This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7&nbsp;GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a face-centered cubic (<i>fcc</i>) symmetry and space group <i>Fm3m</i>. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the enthalpy increases by 3.66 kJ/mol. Upon further compression to 25&nbsp;GPa, berkelium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-berkelium structure similar to that of α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the 5f electron shell. No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.</p>\n<p>Upon heating, α-berkelium transforms into another phase with an <i>fcc</i> lattice (but slightly different from β-berkelium), space group <i>Fm3m</i> and the lattice constant of 500&nbsp;pm; this <i>fcc</i> structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC. This phase is metastable and will gradually revert to the original α-berkelium phase at room temperature. The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point.</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<p>Like all actinides, berkelium dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the berkelium(III) state. This trivalent oxidation state (+3) is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent (+4) and possibly divalent (+2) berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. A similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of berkelium, terbium. Aqueous solutions of Bk ions are green in most acids. The color of Bk ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due to the formation of a protective oxide layer surface. However, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of berkelium</div>\n<p>About twenty isotopes and six nuclear isomers (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the atomic numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All of them are radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for Bk (1,380&nbsp;years), Bk (9 years) and Bk (330&nbsp;days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak – 1.45×10% with respect to the β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.</p>\n<h3>Occurrence</h3>\n<p>All berkelium isotopes have a half-life far too short to be primordial. Therefore, all primordial berkelium, that is, berkelium present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now.</p>\n<p>On Earth, berkelium is mostly concentrated in certain areas, which were used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster, Three Mile Island accident and 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.</p>\n<p>Nuclear reactors produce mostly, among the berkelium isotopes, berkelium-249. During the storage and before the fuel disposal, most of it beta decays to californium-249. The latter has a half-life of 351 years, which is relatively long when compared to the other isotopes produced in the reactor, and is therefore undesirable in the disposal products.</p>\n<p>A few atoms of berkelium can be produced by neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly concentrated uranium-bearing deposits, thus making it the rarest naturally occurring element.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGlenn T. Seaborg</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Although very small amounts of berkelium were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in December 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso and Stanley G. Thompson. They used the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of americium (element 95) and curium (element 96) in 1944, the new elements berkelium and californium (element 98) were both produced in 1949–1950.</p>\n<p>The name choice for element 97 followed the previous tradition of the Californian group to draw an analogy between the newly discovered actinide and the lanthanide element positioned above it in the periodic table. Previously, americium was named after a continent as its analogue europium, and curium honored scientists Marie and Pierre Curie as the lanthanide above it, gadolinium, was named after the explorer of the rare earth elements Johan Gadolin. Thus the discovery report by the Berkeley group reads: \"It is suggested that element 97 be given the name berkelium (symbol Bk) after the city of Berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue terbium (atomic number 65) whose name was derived from the town of Ytterby, Sweden, where the rare earth minerals were first found.\" This tradition ended on berkelium, though, as the naming of the next discovered actinide, californium, was not related to its lanthanide analogue dysprosium, but after the discovery place.</p>\n<p>The most difficult steps in the synthesis of berkelium were its separation from the final products and the production of sufficient quantities of americium for the target material. First, americium (Am) nitrate solution was coated on a platinum foil, the solution was evaporated and the residue converted by annealing to americium dioxide (AmO). This target was irradiated with 35&nbsp;MeV alpha particles for 6 hours in the 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley. The (α,2n) reaction induced by the irradiation yielded the Bk isotope and two free neutrons:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>After the irradiation, the coating was dissolved with nitric acid and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution. The product was centrifugated and re-dissolved in nitric acid. To separate berkelium from the unreacted americium, this solution was added to a mixture of ammonium and ammonium sulfate and heated to convert all the dissolved americium into the oxidation state +6. Unoxidized residual americium was precipitated by the addition of hydrofluoric acid as americium(III) fluoride (AmF\n3). This step yielded a mixture of the accompanying product curium and the expected element 97 in form of trifluorides. The mixture was converted to the corresponding hydroxides by treating it with potassium hydroxide, and after centrifugation, was dissolved in perchloric acid.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nChromatographic elution curves revealing the similarity between the lanthanides terbium (Tb), gadolinium (Gd), and europium (Eu) and their corresponding actinides berkelium (Bk), curium (Cm), and americium (Am)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Further separation was carried out in the presence of a citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH≈3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperature. The chromatographic separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for characteristic X-rays and conversion electron signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its mass number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report, but was later established as 243.</p>\n<h2>Synthesis and extraction</h2>\n<h3>Preparation of isotopes</h3>\n<p>Berkelium is produced by bombarding lighter actinides uranium (U) or plutonium (Pu) with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. In a more common case of uranium fuel, plutonium is produced first by neutron capture (the so-called (n,γ) reaction or neutron fusion) followed by beta-decay:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd> <small>(the times are half-lives)</small></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Plutonium-239 is further irradiated by a source that has a high neutron flux, several times higher than a conventional nuclear reactor, such as the 85-megawatt High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA. The higher flux promotes fusion reactions involving not one but several neutrons, converting Pu to Cm and then to Cm:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Curium-249 has a short half-life of 64 minutes, and thus its further conversion to Cm has a low probability. Instead, it transforms by beta-decay into Bk:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The thus-produced Bk has a long half-life of 330 days and thus can capture another neutron. However, the product, Bk, again has a relatively short half-life of 3.212 hours and thus, does not yield any heavier berkelium isotopes. Instead decays to the californium isotope Cf:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Although Bk is the most stable isotope of berkelium, its production in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, which does not allow it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, Bk is the most accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66&nbsp;grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram.</p>\n<p>The isotope Bk was first obtained in 1956 by bombarding a mixture of curium isotopes with 25 MeV α-particles. Although its direct detection was hindered by strong signal interference with Bk, the existence of a new isotope was proven by the growth of the decay product Cf which had been previously characterized. The half-life of Cf was estimated as 23 ± 5 hours and a more reliable value still is not known. Berkelium-247 was produced during the same year by irradiating Cm with alpha-particles:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Berkelium-242 was synthesized in 1979 by bombarding U with B, U with B, Th with N or Th with N. It converts by electron capture to Cm with a half-life of 7.0 ± 1.3 minutes. A search for an initially suspected isotope Bk was then unsuccessful; Bk has since been synthesized.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Separation</h3>\n<p>The fact that berkelium readily assumes oxidation state +4 in solids, and is relatively stable in this state in liquids greatly assists separation of berkelium away from many other actinides. These are inevitably produced in relatively large amounts during the nuclear synthesis and often favor the +3 state. This fact was not yet known in the initial experiments, which used a more complex separation procedure. Various oxidation agents can be applied to the berkelium(III) solutions to convert it to the +4 state, such as bromates (BrO−\n3), bismuthates (BiO−\n3), chromates (CrO2−\n4 and Cr\n2O2−\n7), silver(I) thiolate (Ag\n2S\n2O\n8), lead(IV) oxide (PbO\n2), ozone (O\n3), or photochemical oxidation procedures. Berkelium(IV) is then extracted with ion exchange, extraction chromatography or liquid-liquid extraction using HDEHP (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric scid), amines, tributyl phosphate or various other reagents. These procedures separate berkelium from most trivalent actinides and lanthanides, except for the lanthanide cerium (lanthanides are absent in the irradiation target but are created in various nuclear fission decay chains).</p>\n<p>A more detailed procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted using one of the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.</p>\n<h3>Bulk metal preparation</h3>\n<p>In order to characterize chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target and in the first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6&nbsp;micrograms) of berkelium by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years. This irradiation method was and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.</p>\n<p>The world's major irradiation sources are the 85-megawatt High Flux Isotope Reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, and the SM-2 loop reactor at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Russia, which are both dedicated to the production of transcurium elements (atomic number greater than 96). These facilities have similar power and flux levels, and are expected to have comparable production capacities for transcurium elements, although the quantities produced at NIIAR are not publicly reported. In a \"typical processing campaign\" at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium, milligram quantities of berkelium-249 and einsteinium, and picogram quantities of fermium. In total, just over one gram of berkelium-249 has been produced at Oak Ridge since 1967.</p>\n<p>The first berkelium metal sample weighing 1.7&nbsp;micrograms was prepared in 1971 by the reduction of berkelium(III) fluoride with lithium vapor at 1000&nbsp;°C; the fluoride was suspended on a tungsten wire above a tantalum crucible containing molten lithium. Later, metal samples weighting up to 0.5&nbsp;milligrams were obtained with this method.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Similar results are obtained with berkelium(IV) fluoride. Berkelium metal can also be produced by the reduction of berkelium(IV) oxide with thorium or lanthanum.</p>\n<h2>Compounds</h2>\n<div>Main article: Compounds of berkelium</div>\n<h3>Oxides</h3>\n<p>Two oxides of berkelium are known, with the berkelium oxidation state of +3 (BkO) and +4 (BkO). Berkelium(IV) oxide is a brown solid, while berkelium(III) oxide is a yellow-green solid with a melting point of 1920 °C and is formed from BkO by reduction with molecular hydrogen:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Upon heating to 1200 °C, the oxide BkO undergoes a phase change; it undergoes another phase change at 1750 °C. Such three-phase behavior is typical for the actinide sesquioxides. Berkelium(II) oxide, BkO, has been reported as a brittle gray solid but its exact chemical composition remains uncertain.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<p>In halides, berkelium assumes the oxidation states +3 and +4. The +3 state is the most stable, especially in solutions, while the tetravalent halides BkF and CsBkCl are only known in the solid phase. The coordination of berkelium atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped trigonal prismatic, with the coordination number of 9. In trivalent bromide, it is bicapped trigonal prismatic (coordination 8) or octahedral (coordination 6), and in the iodide it is octahedral.</p>\n\n<p>Berkelium(IV) fluoride (BkF) is a yellow-green ionic solid and is isotypic with uranium tetrafluoride or zirconium(IV) fluoride. Berkelium(III) fluoride (BkF) is also a yellow-green solid, but it has two crystalline structures. The most stable phase at low temperatures is isotypic with yttrium(III) fluoride, while upon heating to between 350 and 600 °C, it transforms to the structure found in lanthanum(III) fluoride.</p>\n<p>Visible amounts of berkelium(III) chloride (BkCl) were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram. It can be prepared by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature about 500&nbsp;°C. This green solid has a melting point of 600 °C, and is isotypic with uranium(III) chloride. Upon heating to nearly melting point, BkCl converts into an orthorhombic phase.</p>\n<p>Two forms of berkelium(III) bromide are known: one with berkelium having coordination 6, and one with coordination 8. The latter is less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350&nbsp;°C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied on these two crystal forms: the structure of fresh and aged BkBr samples was probed by X-ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years, so that various fractions of berkelium-249 had beta decayed to californium-249. No change in structure was observed upon the BkBr—CfBr transformation. However, other differences were noted for BkBr and CfBr. For example, the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to CfBr, but the former could not – this result was reproduced on individual BkBr and CfBr samples, as well on the samples containing both bromides. The intergrowth of californium in berkelium occurs at a rate of 0.22% per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties. Beside a chemical contamination, Cf, being an alpha emitter, brings undesirable self-damage of the crystal lattice and the resulting self-heating. The chemical effect however can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results.</p>\n<h3>Other inorganic compounds</h3>\n<p>The pnictides of berkelium-249 of the type BkX are known for the elements nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. They crystallize in the rock-salt structure and are prepared by the reaction of either berkelium(III) hydride (BkH) or metallic berkelium with these elements at elevated temperature (about 600&nbsp;°C) under high vacuum.</p>\n<p>Berkelium(III) sulfide, BkS, is prepared by either treating berkelium oxide with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide vapors at 1130&nbsp;°C, or by directly reacting metallic berkelium with elemental sulfur. These procedures yield brownish-black crystals.</p>\n<p>Berkelium(III) and berkelium(IV) hydroxides are both stable in 1 molar solutions of sodium hydroxide. Berkelium(III) phosphate (BkPO) has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under excitation with a green light. Berkelium hydrides are produced by reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 °C. They are non-stoichiometric with the nominal formula BkH (0 &lt; x &lt; 1). Several other salts of berkelium are known, including an oxysulfide (BkOS), and hydrated nitrate (Bk(NO\n3)\n3·4H\n2O), chloride (BkCl\n3·6H\n2O), sulfate (Bk\n2(SO\n4)\n3·12H\n2O) and oxalate (Bk\n2(C\n2O\n4)\n3·4H\n2O). Thermal decomposition at about 600 °C in an argon atmosphere (to avoid oxidation to BkO\n2) of Bk\n2(SO\n4)\n3·12H\n2O yields the crystals of berkelium(III) oxysulfate (Bk\n2O\n2SO\n4). This compound is thermally stable to at least 1000 °C in inert atmosphere.</p>\n<h3>Organoberkelium compounds</h3>\n<p>Berkelium forms a trigonal (η–CH)Bk metallocene complex with three cyclopentadienyl rings, which can be synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(CH)) at about 70&nbsp;°C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250&nbsp;°C, and sublimates without melting at about 350&nbsp;°C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks). One cyclopentadienyl ring in (η–CH)Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield [Bk(CH)Cl]. The optical absorption spectra of this compound are very similar to those of (η–CH)Bk.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe berkelium target used for the synthesis of ununseptium (in dissolved state)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>There is currently no use for any isotope of berkelium outside of basic scientific research. Berkelium-249 is a common target nuclide to prepare still heavier transuranic elements and transactinides, such as lawrencium, rutherfordium and bohrium. It is also useful as a source of the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR.</p>\n<p>A 22&nbsp;milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared in a 250-day irradiation and then purified for 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This target yielded the first 6 atoms of ununseptium at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Russia, after bombarding it with calcium ions in the U400 cyclotron for 150 days. This synthesis was a culmination of the Russia—US collaboration between JINR and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118 which was initiated in 1989.</p>\n<h2>Nuclear fuel cycle</h2>\n<p>The nuclear fission properties of berkelium are different from those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium, and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Specifically, berkelium-249 has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of 710 barns for thermal neutrons, 1200 barns resonance integral, but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons. In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250. In principle, berkelium-249 can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a fast breeder reactor. Its critical mass is relatively high at 192&nbsp;kg; it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope.</p>\n<p>Berkelium-247 can maintain chain reaction both in a thermal-neutron and in a fast-neutron reactor, however, its production is rather complex and thus the availability is much lower than its critical mass, which is about 75.7&nbsp;kg for a bare sphere, 41.2&nbsp;kg with a water reflector and 35.2&nbsp;kg with a steel reflector (30&nbsp;cm thickness).</p>\n<h2>Health issues</h2>\n<p>Little is known about the effects of berkelium on human body, and analogies with other elements may not be drawn because of different radiation products (electrons for berkelium and alpha particles, neutrons, or both for most other actinides). The low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium-249 (less than 126 keV) hinders its detection, due to signal interference with other decay processes, but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides. However, berkelium-249 transforms with a half-life of only 330 days to the strong alpha-emitter californium-249, which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a glove box in a dedicated laboratory.</p>\n<p>Most available berkelium toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50&nbsp;years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20&nbsp;years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted. In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the skeletal system its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum permissible amount of berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4&nbsp;nanograms.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^    Hammond C. R. \"The elements\" in Lide, D. R., ed. (2005).

  "title": "Californium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Californium</b> is a radioactive metallic chemical element with the symbol <b>Cf</b> and atomic number&nbsp;98. The element was first made at the University of California, Berkeley in 1950 by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the unaided eye (after einsteinium). The element was named after California and the University of California. It is the heaviest element to occur naturally on Earth; heavier elements can only be produced by synthesis.</p>\n<p>Two crystalline forms exist for californium under normal pressure: one above 900&nbsp;°C and one below 900 °C. A third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. Compounds of californium are dominated by a chemical form of the element, designated californium(III), that can participate in three chemical bonds. The most stable of californium's twenty known isotopes is californium-251, which has a half-life of 898&nbsp;years. This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust. Californium-252, with a half-life of about 2.64&nbsp;years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia.</p>\n<p>Californium is one of the few transuranium elements that have practical applications. Most of these applications exploit the property of certain isotopes of californium to emit neutrons. For example, californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors, and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials with neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy. Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements; ununoctium (element&nbsp;118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with calcium-48 ions. Use of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element's ability to disrupt the formation of red blood cells by bioaccumulating in skeletal tissue.</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical properties</h3>\n<p>Californium is a silvery white actinide metal with a melting point of 900&nbsp;± 30&nbsp;°C and an estimated boiling point of 1745&nbsp;K. The pure metal is malleable and is easily cut with a razor blade. Californium metal starts to vaporize above 300&nbsp;°C when exposed to a vacuum. Below 51&nbsp;K (−220&nbsp;°C) californium metal is either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic (it acts like a magnet), between 48 and 66&nbsp;K it is antiferromagnetic (an intermediate state), and above 160&nbsp;K (−110&nbsp;°C) it is paramagnetic (external magnetic fields can make it magnetic). It forms alloys with lanthanide metals but little is known about them.</p>\n<p>The element has two crystalline forms under 1 standard atmosphere of pressure: A double-hexagonal close-packed form dubbed alpha (α) and a face-centered cubic form designated beta (β). The α form exists below 900&nbsp;°C with a density of 15.10 g/cm and the β form exists above 900&nbsp;°C with a density of 8.74 g/cm. At 48&nbsp;GPa of pressure the β form changes into an orthorhombic crystal system due to de-localization of the atom's 5f electrons, which frees them to bond.</p>\n<p>The bulk modulus of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure. Californium's bulk modulus is 50&nbsp;± 5&nbsp;GPa, which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium (70&nbsp;GPa).</p>\n<h3>Chemical properties and compounds</h3>\n<div>Further information: Compounds of californium</div>\n\n<p>Californium exhibits valences of 4, 3, or 2; indicating the number of chemical bonds one atom of this element can form. Its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other primarily 3+ valence actinide elements and the element dysprosium, which is the lanthanide above californium in the periodic table. The element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature, with the rate increasing when moisture is added. Californium reacts when heated with hydrogen, nitrogen, or a chalcogen (oxygen family element); reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous mineral acids are rapid.</p>\n<p>Californium is only water soluble as the californium(III) cation. Attempts to reduce or oxidize the +3 ion in solution have failed. The element forms a water-soluble chloride, nitrate, perchlorate, and sulfate and is precipitated as a fluoride, oxalate, or hydroxide.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of californium</div>\n<p>Twenty radioisotopes of californium have been characterized, the most stable being californium-251 with a half-life of 898 years, californium-249 with a half-life of 351 years, californium-250 with a half-life of 13.08 years, and californium-252 with a half-life of 2.645 years. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than a year, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes. The isotopes of californium range in mass number from 237 to 256.</p>\n<p>Californium-249 is formed from the beta decay of berkelium-249, and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor. Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high neutron capture) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high neutron cross-section).</p>\n<p>Californium-252 is a very strong neutron emitter, which makes it extremely radioactive and harmful. Californium-252 undergoes alpha decay (the loss of two protons and two neutrons) 96.9% of the time to form curium-248 while the remaining 3.1% of decays are spontaneous fission. One microgram (µg) of californium-252 emits 2.3&nbsp;million neutrons per second, an average of 3.7 neutrons per spontaneous fission. Most of the other isotopes of californium decay to isotopes of curium (atomic number 96) via alpha decay.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe 60-inch-diameter (1,500&nbsp;mm) cyclotron used to first synthesize californium</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Californium was first synthesized at the University of California, Berkeley by the physics researchers Stanley G. Thompson, Kenneth Street, Jr., Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T. Seaborg on or about February 9, 1950. It was the sixth transuranium element to be discovered; the team announced its discovery on March 17, 1950.</p>\n<p>To produce californium, a microgram-sized target of curium-242 (242\n96Cm) was bombarded with 35&nbsp;MeV-alpha particles (4\n2He) in the 60-inch-diameter (1,500&nbsp;mm) cyclotron at Berkeley, California, which produced californium-245 (245\n98Cf) plus one free neutron (n).</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>242\n96Cm + 4\n2He → 245\n98Cf + 1\n0n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment, and these atoms had a half-life of 44&nbsp;minutes.</p>\n<p>The discoverers named the new element after California and the University of California. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named. However, the element directly above element&nbsp;98 in the periodic table, dysprosium, has a name that simply means \"hard to get at\" so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention. They added that \"the best we can do is to point out [that] ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California.\"</p>\n<p>Weighable quantities of californium were first produced by the irradiation of plutonium targets at the Materials Testing Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory; and these findings were reported in 1954. The high spontaneous fission rate of californium-252 was observed in these samples. The first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in 1958. The isotopes californium-249 to californium-252 were isolated that same year from a sample of plutonium-239 that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years. Two years later, in 1960, Burris Cunningham and James Wallman of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California created the first californium compounds—californium trichloride, californium oxychloride, and californium oxide—by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid.</p>\n<p>The High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, started producing small batches of californium in the 1960s. By 1995, the HFIR nominally produced 500&nbsp;milligrams of californium annually. Plutonium supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States under the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement was used for californium production.</p>\n<p>The Atomic Energy Commission sold californium-252 to industrial and academic customers in the early 1970s for $10 per microgram and an average of 150&nbsp;mg of californium-252 were shipped each year from 1970 to 1990. Californium metal was first prepared in 1974 by Haire and Baybarz who reduced californium(III) oxide with lanthanum metal to obtain microgram amounts of sub-micrometer thick films.</p>\n<h2>Occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nNuclear testing has contaminated the environment with traces of californium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Very minute amounts of californium have been found to exist on Earth due to neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly-concentrated uranium-bearing deposits. Traces of californium can be found near facilities that use the element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments. The element is fairly insoluble in water, but it adheres well to ordinary soil; and concentrations of it in the soil can be 500 times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles.</p>\n<p>Fallout from atmospheric nuclear testing prior to 1980 contributed a small amount of californium to the environment. Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. Californium is not a major radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.</p>\n<p>Californium was once believed to be produced in supernovas, as their decay matches the 60 day half-life of Cf. However, subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any californium spectra, and supernova light curves are now thought to follow the decay of nickel-56.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>See also: Nuclear fuel cycle</div>\n<p>Californium is produced in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. Californium-250 is made by bombarding berkelium-249 (249\n97Bk) with neutrons, forming berkelium-250 (250\n97Bk) via neutron capture (n,γ) which, in turn, quickly beta decays (β) to californium-250 (250\n98Cf) in the following reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>249\n97Bk(n,γ)250\n97Bk → 250\n98Cf + β</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Bombardment of californium-250 with neutrons produces californium-251 and californium-252.</p>\n<p>Prolonged irradiation of americium, curium, and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium-252 and microgram amounts of californium-249. As of 2006, curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium-252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255.</p>\n<p>Microgram quantities of californium-252 are available for commercial use through the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Only two sites produce californium-252 – the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, Russia. As of 2003, the two sites produce 0.25&nbsp;grams and 0.025&nbsp;grams of californium-252 per year, respectively.</p>\n<p>Three californium isotopes with significant half-lives are produced, requiring a total of 15 neutron captures by uranium-238 without nuclear fission or alpha decay occurring during the process. Californium-253 is at the end of a production chain that starts with uranium-238, includes several isotopes of plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).<br></p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nScheme of the production of californium-252 from uranium-238 by neutron irradiation</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFifty-ton shipping cask built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which can transport up to 1 gram of Cf. Large and heavily shielded transport containers are needed to prevent the release of highly radioactive material in case of normal and hypothetical accidents.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Californium-252 has a number of specialized applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium useful as a neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) neutron source for neutron activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119&nbsp;µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant. It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries.</p>\n<p>Neutron penetration into materials makes californium useful in detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners; neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable metal detectors. Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for gold and silver prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.</p>\n<p>Californium-251 has a very small critical mass (about 5&nbsp;kg), high lethality, and a relatively short period of toxic environmental irradiation. The low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element.</p>\n<p>In October 2006, researchers announced that three atoms of ununoctium (element 118) had been identified at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, as the product of bombardment of californium-249 with calcium-48, making it the heaviest element ever synthesized. The target for this experiment contained about 10&nbsp;mg of californium-249 deposited on a titanium foil of 32&nbsp;cm area. Californium has also been used to produce other transuranium elements; for example, element 103 (later named lawrencium) was first synthesized in 1961 by bombarding californium with boron nuclei.</p>\n<h2>Precautions</h2>\n<p>Californium that bioaccumulates in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts the body's ability to form red blood cells. The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.</p>\n<p>Californium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.</p>\n<p>The element is most dangerous if taken into the body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through gamma ray emission. Ionizing radiation emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ The Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, and the extent of natural neutron emission within it that could produce californium from more stable elements is extremely limited.</li>\n<li>^ A double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) unit cell consists of two hexagonal close-packed structures that share a common hexagonal plane, giving dhcp an ABACABAC sequence.</li>\n<li>^ The three lower-mass transplutonium elements—americium, curium, and berkelium—require much less pressure to delocalize their 5f electrons.</li>\n<li>^ Other +3 oxidation states include the sulfide and metallocene. Compounds in the +4 oxidation state are strong oxidizing agents and those in the +2 state are strong reducing agents.</li>\n<li>^ Europium, in the sixth period directly above element 95, was named for the continent it was discovered on, so element 95 was named americium. Element 96 was named for Marie Curie and Pierre Curie as an analog to the naming of gadolinium, which was named for the scientist and engineer Johan Gadolin. Terbium was named for the city it was discovered in, so element 97 was named berkelium.</li>\n<li>^ The Nuclear Regulatory Commission replaced the Atomic Energy Commission when the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 was implemented. The price of californium-252 was increased by the NRC several times and was $60 per microgram by 1999; this price does not include the cost of encapsulation and transportation.</li>\n<li>^ In 1975, another paper stated that the californium metal prepared the year before was the hexagonal compound CfOS and face-centered cubic compound CfS. The 1974 work was confirmed in 1976 and work on californium metal continued.</li>\n<li>^ By 1990, californium-252 had replaced plutonium-beryllium neutron sources due to its smaller size and lower heat and gas generation.</li>\n<li>^ An article entitled \"Facts and Fallacies of World War III\" in the July 1961, edition of Popular Science magazine read \"A californium atomic bomb need be no bigger than a pistol bullet. You could build a hand-held six-shooter to fire bullets that would explode on contact with the force of 10 tons of TNT.\"</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^     CRC 2006, p.&nbsp;4.56.</li>\n<li>^ CRC 2006, p.&nbsp;1.14.</li>\n<li>^ Joseph Jacob Katz; Glenn Theodore Seaborg; Lester R.

  "title": "Einsteinium",
  "html": "<div>\"Athenium\" redirects here. For other uses, see Athenaeum.</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Einsteinium</b> is a synthetic element with the symbol <b>Es</b> and atomic number 99. It is the seventh transuranic element, and an actinide.</p>\n<p>Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex procedure of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside of basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.</p>\n<p>Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, paramagnetic metal. Its chemistry is typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 watts per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's conversion to berkelium and then californium at a rate of about 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half life, einsteinium-252 (half life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.</p>\n<p>Like all synthetic transuranic elements, isotopes of einsteinium are extremely radioactive and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEinsteinium was first observed in the fallout from the <i>Ivy Mike</i> nuclear test.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe element was named after Albert Einstein.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Einsteinium was first identified in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the University of California, Berkeley in collaboration with the Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, in the fallout from the <i>Ivy Mike</i> nuclear test. The test was carried out on November 1, 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, 244\n94Pu, which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>At the time, the multiple neutron absorption was thought to be an extremely rare process, but the identification of 244\n94Pu indicated that still more neutrons could have been captured by the uranium nuclei, thereby producing new elements heavier than californium.</p>\n<p>Ghiorso and co-workers analyzed filter papers which had been flown through the explosion cloud on airplanes (the same sampling technique that had been used to discover 244\n94Pu). Larger amounts of radioactive material were later isolated from coral debris of the atoll, which were delivered to the U.S. The separation of suspected new elements was carried out in the presence of a citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH ≈ 3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperatures; fewer than 200 atoms of einsteinium were recovered in the end. Nevertheless, element 99 (einsteinium), namely its Es isotope, could be detected via its characteristic high-energy alpha decay at 6.6 MeV. It was produced by the capture of 15 neutrons by uranium-238 nuclei followed by seven beta-decays, and had a half-life of 20.5 days. Such multiple neutron absorption was made possible by the high neutron flux density during the detonation, so that newly generated heavy isotopes had plenty of available neutrons to absorb before they could disintegrate into lighter elements. Neutron capture initially raised the mass number without changing the atomic number of the nuclide, and the concomitant beta-decays resulted in a gradual increase in the atomic number:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Some U atoms, however, could absorb another two neutrons (for a total of 17), resulting in Es, as well as in the Fm isotope of another new element, fermium. The discovery of the new elements and the associated new data on multiple neutron capture were initially kept secret on the orders of the U.S.&nbsp;military until 1955 due to Cold War tensions and competition with Soviet Union in nuclear technologies. However, the rapid capture of so many neutrons would provide needed direct experimental confirmation of the so-called r-process multiple neutron absorption needed to explain the cosmic nucleosynthesis (production) of certain heavy chemical elements (heavier than nickel) in supernova explosions, before beta decay. Such a process is needed to explain the existence of many stable elements in the universe.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, isotopes of element 99 (as well as of new element 100, fermium) were produced in the Berkeley and Argonne laboratories, in a nuclear reaction between nitrogen-14 and uranium-238, and later by intense neutron irradiation of plutonium or californium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These results were published in several articles in 1954 with the disclaimer that these were not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements. The Berkeley team also reported some results on the chemical properties of einsteinium and fermium. The <i>Ivy Mike</i> results were declassified and published in 1955.</p>\n<p>In their discovery of the elements 99 and 100, the American teams had competed with a group at the Nobel Institute for Physics, Stockholm, Sweden. In late 1953 – early 1954, the Swedish group succeeded in the synthesis of light isotopes of element 100, in particular Fm, by bombarding uranium with oxygen nuclei. These results were also published in 1954. Nevertheless, the priority of the Berkeley team was generally recognized, as its publications preceded the Swedish article, and they were based on the previously undisclosed results of the 1952 thermonuclear explosion; thus the Berkeley team was given the privilege to name the new elements. As the effort which had led to the design of <i>Ivy Mike</i> was codenamed Project PANDA, element 99 had been jokingly nicknamed \"Pandamonium\" but the official names suggested by the Berkeley group derived from two prominent and recently deceased scientists, Albert Einstein (died 18 April 1955) and Enrico Fermi (died 28 November 1954): \"We suggest for the name for the element with the atomic number 99, einsteinium (symbol E) after Albert Einstein and for the name for the element with atomic number 100, fermium (symbol Fm), after Enrico Fermi.\" The discovery of these new elements was announced by Albert Ghiorso at the first Geneva Atomic Conference held on 8–20 August 1955. The symbol for einsteinium was first given as \"E\" and later changed to \"Es\" by IUPAC.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nGlow due to the intense radiation from ~300 µg of Es.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, radioactive metal. In the periodic table, it is located to the right of the actinide californium, to the left of the actinide fermium and below the lanthanide holmium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84 g/cm is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79 g/cm), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860 °C) is also relatively low – below californium (900 °C), fermium (1527 °C) and holmium (1461 °C). Einsteinium is a soft metal, with the bulk modulus of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the lighter actinides californium, berkelium, curium and americium which crystallize in a double hexagonal structure at ambient conditions, einsteinium is believed to have a face-centered cubic (<i>fcc</i>) symmetry with the space group <i>Fm3m</i> and the lattice constant <i>a</i> = 575 pm. However, there is a report of room-temperature hexagonal einsteinium metal with <i>a</i> = 398 pm and <i>c</i> = 650 pm, which converted to the <i>fcc</i> phase upon heating to 300 °C.</p>\n<p>The self-damage induced by the radioactivity of einsteinium is so strong that it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.</p>\n<p>The metal is divalent and has a noticeably high volatility. In order to reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid einsteinium and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing. Also, some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant gas, for example HO+HCl for EsOCl so that the sample is partly regrown during its decomposition.</p>\n<p>Apart from the self-destruction of solid einsteinium and its compounds, other intrinsic difficulties in studying this element include scarcity – the most common Es isotope is available only once or twice a year in sub-milligram amounts – and self-contamination due to rapid conversion of einsteinium to berkelium and then to californium at a rate of about 3.3% per day:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Thus, most einsteinium samples are contaminated, and their intrinsic properties are often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time. Other experimental techniques to circumvent the contamination problem include selective optical excitation of einsteinium ions by a tunable laser, such as in studying its luminescence properties.</p>\n<p>Magnetic properties have been studied for einsteinium metal, its oxide and fluoride. All three materials showed Curie–Weiss paramagnetic behavior from liquid helium to room temperature. The effective magnetic moments were deduced as 10.4 ± 0.3 µ for EsO and 11.4 ± 0.3 µ for the EsF, which are the highest values among actinides, and the corresponding Curie temperatures are 53 and 37 K.</p>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<p>Like all actinides, einsteinium is rather reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 state is not observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.</p>\n<h3>Isotopes</h3>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of einsteinium</div>\n<p>Nineteen nuclides and three nuclear isomers are known for einsteinium with atomic weights ranging from 240 to 258. All are radioactive and the most stable nuclide, Es, has a half-life of 471.7 days. Next most stable isotopes are Es (half-life 275.7 days), Es (39.8 days) and Es (20.47 days). All of the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than 40 hours, and most of them decay within less than 30 minutes. Of the three nuclear isomers, the most stable is Es with half-life of 39.3 hours.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear fission</h3>\n<p>Einsteinium has a high rate of nuclear fission that results in a low critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 or even 2.26 kilograms, respectively, by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel or water reflector. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare Es isotope.</p>\n<h3>Natural occurrence</h3>\n<p>Because of the short half-life of all isotopes of einsteinium, all primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most einsteinium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only within a few years from the time of the synthesis. Einsteinium and fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.</p>\n<h2>Synthesis and extraction</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEarly evolution of einsteinium production in the U.S.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Einsteinium is produced in minute quantities by bombarding lighter actinides with neutrons in dedicated high-flux nuclear reactors. The world's major irradiation sources are the 85-megawatt High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, U.S., and the SM-2 loop reactor at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Russia, which are both dedicated to the production of transcurium (<i>Z</i>&nbsp;&gt; 96) elements. These facilities have similar power and flux levels, and are expected to have comparable production capacities for transcurium elements, although the quantities produced at NIIAR are not widely reported. In a \"typical processing campaign\" at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium, milligram quantities of berkelium (Bk) and einsteinium and picogram quantities of fermium.</p>\n<p>The first microscopic sample of Es sample weighing about 10 nanograms was prepared in 1961 at HFIR. A special magnetic balance was designed to estimate its weight. Larger batches were produced later starting from several kilograms of plutonium with the einsteinium yields (mostly Es) of 0.48 milligrams in 1967–1970, 3.2 milligrams in 1971–1973, followed by steady production of about 3 milligrams per year between 1974 and 1978. These quantities however refer to the integral amount in the target right after irradiation. Subsequent separation procedures reduced the amount of isotopically pure einsteinium roughly tenfold.</p>\n<h3>Laboratory synthesis</h3>\n<p>Heavy neutron irradiation of plutonium results in four major isotopes of einsteinium: Es (α-emitter with half-life of 20.03 days and with a spontaneous fission half-life of 7×10 years); Es (β-emitter with half-life of 38.5 hours), Es (α-emitter with half-life of about 276 days) and Es (β-emitter with half-life of 24 days). An alternative route involves bombardment of uranium-238 with high-intensity nitrogen or oxygen ion beams.</p>\n<p>Einsteinium-247 (half-life 4.55 minutes) was produced by irradiating americium-241 with carbon or uranium-238 with nitrogen ions. The latter reaction was first realized in 1967 in Dubna, Russia, and the involved scientists were awarded the Lenin Komsomol Prize.</p>\n<p>The isotope Es was produced by irradiating Cf with deuterium ions. It mainly decays by emission of electrons to Cf with a half-life of 25 (±5) minutes, but also releases α-particles of 6.87 MeV energy, with the ratio of electrons to α-particles of about 400.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The heavier isotopes Es, Es, Es and Es were obtained by bombarding Bk with α-particles. One to four neutrons are liberated in this process making possible the formation of four different isotopes in one reaction.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Einsteinium-253 was produced by irradiating a 0.1–0.2 milligram Cf target with a thermal neutron flux of (2–5)×10 neutrons·cm·s for 500–900 hours:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Synthesis in nuclear explosions</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEstimated yield of transuranium elements in the U.S. nuclear tests Hutch and Cyclamen.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The analysis of the debris at the 10-megaton <i>Ivy Mike</i> nuclear test was a part of long-term project. One of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was that synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful man-made neutron sources, providing densities of the order 10 neutrons/cm² within a microsecond, or about 10 neutrons/(cm²·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5×10 neutrons/(cm²·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at Enewetak Atoll for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the mainland U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, none of these were found even after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.</p>\n<p>The atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.</p>\n<p>Among the nine underground tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969, the last one was the most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond. However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4×10 of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1×10 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4&nbsp;kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.</p>\n<p>Although no new elements (apart from einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.</p>\n<h3>Separation</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nElution curves: chromatographic separation of Fm(100), Es(99), Cf, Bk, Cm and Am</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Separation procedure of einsteinium depends on the synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target is attached to a thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.</p>\n<p>Separation of trivalent actinides from lanthanide fission products can be done by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) as eluant. It is usually followed by anion-exchange chromatography using 6 molar HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with ammonium salts is then used to separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position/time, using α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB), for example, as eluant.</p>\n<p>Separation of the 3+ actinides can also be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.</p>\n<h3>Preparation of the metal</h3>\n<p>Einsteinium is highly reactive and therefore strong reducing agents are required to obtain the pure metal from its compounds. This can be achieved by reduction of einsteinium(III) fluoride with metallic lithium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>EsF + 3 Li → Es + 3 LiF</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>However, owing to its low melting point and high rate of self-radiation damage, einsteinium has high vapor pressure, which is higher than that of lithium fluoride. This makes this reduction reaction rather inefficient. It was tried in the early preparation attempts and quickly abandoned in favor of reduction of einsteinium(III) oxide with lanthanum metal:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>EsO + 2 La → 2 Es + LaO</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Chemical compounds</h2>\n\n<h3>Oxides</h3>\n<p>Einsteinium(III) oxide (EsO) was obtained by burning einsteinium(III) nitrate. It forms colorless cubic crystals, which were first characterized from microgram samples sized about 30 nanometers. Two other phases, monoclinic and hexagonal, are known for this oxide. The formation of a certain EsO phase depends on the preparation technique and sample history, and there is no clear phase diagram. Interconversions between the three phases can occur spontaneously, as a result of self-irradiation or self-heating. The hexagonal phase is isotypic with lanthanum(III) oxide where the Es ion is surrounded by a 6-coordinated group of O ions.</p>\n<h3>Halides</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEinsteinium(III) iodide glowing in the dark</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Einsteinium halides are known for the oxidation states +2 and +3. The most stable state is +3 for all halides from fluoride to iodide.</p>\n<p>Einsteinium(III) fluoride (EsF) can be precipitated from einsteinium(III) chloride solutions upon reaction with fluoride ions. An alternative preparation procedure is to exposure einsteinium(III) oxide to chlorine trifluoride (ClF) or F gas at a pressure of 1–2 atmospheres and a temperature between 300 and 400 °C. The EsF crystal structure is hexagonal, as in californium(III) fluoride (CfF) where the Es ions are 8-fold coordinated by fluorine ions in a bicapped trigonal prism arrangement.</p>\n<p>Einsteinium(III) chloride (EsCl) can be prepared by annealing einsteinium(III) oxide in the atmosphere of dry hydrogen chloride vapors at about 500 °C for some 20 minutes. It crystallizes upon cooling at about 425 °C into an orange solid with a hexagonal structure of UCl3 type, where einsteinium atoms are 9-fold coordinated by chlorine atoms in a tricapped trigonal prism geometry. Einsteinium(III) bromide (EsBr) is a pale-yellow solid with a monoclinic structure of AlCl type, where the einsteinium atoms are octahedrally coordinated by bromine (coordination number 6).</p>\n<p>The divalent compounds of einsteinium are obtained by reducing the trivalent halides with hydrogen:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 EsX + H → 2 EsX + 2 HX, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X = F, Cl, Br, I</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Einsteinium(II) chloride (EsCl), einsteinium(II) bromide (EsBr), and einsteinium(II) iodide (EsI) have been produced and characterized by optical absorption, with no structural information available yet.</p>\n<p>Known oxyhalides of einsteinium include EsOCl, EsOBr and EsOI. They are synthesized by treating a trihalide with a vapor mixture of water and the corresponding hydrogen halide: for example, EsCl + HO/HCl to obtain EsOCl.</p>\n<h3>Organoeinsteinium compounds</h3>\n<p>The high radioactivity of einsteinium has a potential use in radiation therapy, and organometallic complexes have been synthesized in order to deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium citrate (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs. Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone chelate complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate during the period of 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.</p>\n<p>Luminescence of Es ions was however observed in inorganic hydrochloric acid solutions as well as in organic solution with di(2-ethylhexyl)orthophosphoric acid. It shows a broad peak at about 1064 nanometers (half-width about 100&nbsp;nm) which can be resonantly excited by green light (ca. 495&nbsp;nm wavelength). The luminescence has a lifetime of several microseconds and the quantum yield below 0.1%. The relatively high, compared to lanthanides, non-radiative decay rates in Es were associated with the stronger interaction of f-electrons with the inner Es electrons.</p>\n<h2>Applications</h2>\n<p>There is almost no use for any isotope of einsteinium outside of basic scientific research aiming at production of higher transuranic elements and transactinides.</p>\n<p>In 1955, mendelevium was synthesized by irradiating a target consisting of about 10 atoms of Es in the 60-inch cyclotron at Berkeley Laboratory. The resulting Es(α,n)Md reaction yielded 17 atoms of the new element with the atomic number of 101.</p>\n<p>The rare isotope einsteinium-254 is favored for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms. Hence einsteinium-254 was used as a target in the attempted synthesis of ununennium (element 119) in 1985 by bombarding it with calcium-48 ions at the superHILAC linear accelerator at Berkeley, California. No atoms were identified, setting an upper limit for the cross section of this reaction at 300 nanobarns.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Einsteinium-254 was used as the calibration marker in the chemical analysis spectrometer (\"alpha-scattering surface analyzer\") of the Surveyor 5 lunar probe. The large mass of this isotope reduced the spectral overlap between signals from the marker and the studied lighter elements of the lunar surface.</p>\n<h2>Safety</h2>\n<p>Most of the available einsteinium toxicity data originates from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% einsteinium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20 years, although this is rendered irrelevant by the short half-lives of einsteinium isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested amount is excreted. The distribution of einsteinium over the bone surfaces is uniform and is similar to that of plutonium.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Einsteinium. periodic.lanl.gov</li>\n<li>^    Haire, p. 1579</li>\n<li>^    Hammond C.

  "title": "Fermium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with \"Ferrum\", the Latin name for Iron.</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Fermium</b> is a synthetic element with symbol&nbsp;<b>Fm</b> and atomic number&nbsp;100. It is a member of the actinide series. It is the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not yet been prepared. A total of 19 isotopes are known, with Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.</p>\n<p>It was discovered in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, one of the pioneers of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside of basic scientific research.</p>\n\n<h2>Discovery</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nFermium was first observed in the fallout from the <i>Ivy Mike</i> nuclear test.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe element was named after Enrico Fermi.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Fermium was first discovered in the fallout from the 'Ivy Mike' nuclear test (1&nbsp;November 1952), the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, 244\n94Pu: this could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two β&nbsp;decays. At the time, the absorption of neutrons by a heavy nucleus was thought to be a rare process, but the identification of 244\n94Pu raised the possibility that still more neutrons could have been absorbed by the uranium nuclei, leading to new elements.</p>\n<p>Element&nbsp;99 (einsteinium) was quickly discovered on filter papers which had been flown through the cloud from the explosion (the same sampling technique that had been used to discover 244\n94Pu). It was then identified in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the University of California at Berkeley. They discovered the isotope Es (half-life 20.5 days) that was made by the capture of 15 neutrons by uranium-238 nuclei – which then underwent seven successive beta decays:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><small></small></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Some U atoms, however, could capture another amount of neutrons (most likely, 16 or 17).</p>\n<p>The discovery of fermium (<i>Z</i>&nbsp;= 100) required more material, as the yield was expected to be at least an order of magnitude lower than that of element&nbsp;99, and so contaminated coral from the Enewetak atoll (where the test had taken place) was shipped to the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, for processing and analysis. About two months after the test, a new component was isolated emitting high-energy α-particles (7.1&nbsp;MeV) with a half-life of about a day. With such a short half-life, it could only arise from the β&nbsp;decay of an isotope of einsteinium, and so had to be an isotope of the new element&nbsp;100: it was quickly identified as Fm (<i>t</i>&nbsp;= 20.07(7)&nbsp;hours).</p>\n<p>The discovery of the new elements, and the new data on neutron capture, was initially kept secret on the orders of the U.S.&nbsp;military until 1955 due to Cold War tensions. Nevertheless, the Berkeley team were able to prepare elements 99 and 100 by civilian means, through the neutron bombardment of plutonium-239, and published this work in 1954 with the disclaimer that it was not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements. The 'Ivy Mike' studies were declassified and published in 1955.</p>\n<p>The Berkeley team had been worried that another group might discover lighter isotopes of element&nbsp;100 through ion bombardment techniques before they could publish their classified research, and this proved to be the case. A group at the Nobel Institute for Physics in Stockholm independently discovered the element, producing an isotope later confirmed to be Fm (<i>t</i>&nbsp;= 30&nbsp;minutes) by bombarding a 238\n92U target with oxygen-16 ions, and published their work in May 1954. Nevertheless, the priority of the Berkeley team was generally recognized, and with it the prerogative to name the new element in honour of the recently deceased Enrico Fermi, the developer of the first artificial self-sustained nuclear reactor.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of fermium</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDecay pathway of fermium-257</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<p>There are 19 isotopes of fermium listed in N<small>UBASE</small>&nbsp;2003, with atomic weights of 242 to 260, of which Fm is the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5&nbsp;days. Fm has a half-life of 3 days, while Fm of 5.3&nbsp;h, Fm of 25.4&nbsp;h, Fm of 3.2&nbsp;h, Fm of 20.1&nbsp;h, and Fm of 2.6&nbsp;hours. All the remaining ones have half-lives ranging from 30 minutes to less than a millisecond. The neutron-capture product of fermium-257, Fm, undergoes spontaneous fission with a half-life of just 370(14)&nbsp;microseconds; Fm and Fm are also unstable with respect to spontaneous fission (<i>t</i>&nbsp;= 1.5(3)&nbsp;s and 4&nbsp;ms respectively). This means that neutron capture cannot be used to create nuclides with a mass number greater than 257, unless carried out in a nuclear explosion. As Fm is an α-emitter, decaying to Cf, and no fermium isotopes undergo beta minus decay (which would produce isotopes of the next element, mendelevium), fermium is also the last element that can be prepared by a neutron-capture process.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nElution: chromatographic separation of Fm(100), Es(99), Cf, Bk, Cm and Am.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Fermium is produced by the bombardment of lighter actinides with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Fermium-257 is the heaviest isotope that is obtained via neutron capture, and can only be produced in nanogram quantities. The major source is the 85&nbsp;MW High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, which is dedicated to the production of transcurium (<i>Z</i>&nbsp;&gt; 96) elements. In a \"typical processing campaign\" at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium, milligram quantities of berkelium and einsteinium and picogram quantities of fermium. However, nanogram and microgram quantities of fermium can be prepared for specific experiments. The quantities of fermium produced in 20–200&nbsp;kiloton thermonuclear explosions is believed to be of the order of milligrams, although it is mixed in with a huge quantity of debris; 40&nbsp;picograms of Fm was recovered from 10&nbsp;kilograms of debris from the 'Hutch' test (16&nbsp;July 1969).</p>\n<p>After production, the fermium must be separated from other actinides and from lanthanoid fission products. This is usually achieved by ion exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex&nbsp;50 or T<small>EVA</small> eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.</p>\n<p>Although the most stable isotope of fermium is Fm, with a half-life of 100.5&nbsp;days, most studies are conducted on Fm (<i>t</i>&nbsp;= 20.07(7)&nbsp;hours) as this isotope can be easily isolated as required as the decay product of Es (<i>t</i>&nbsp;= 39.8(12)&nbsp;days).</p>\n<h2>Synthesis in nuclear explosions</h2>\n<p>The analysis of the debris at the 10-megaton <i>Ivy Mike</i> nuclear test was a part of long-term project, one of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was as follows: synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources, providing densities of the order 10 neutrons/cm² within a microsecond, i.e. about 10 neutrons/(cm²·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5×10 neutrons/(cm²·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at Enewetak Atoll for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis, as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, those were not found after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nEstimated yield of transuranium elements in the U.S. nuclear tests Hutch and Cyclamen.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge. They were less successful in terms of yield that was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Isolation of the products was found to be rather problematic, as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing rocks under the great depth of 300–600 meters, and drilling to such depth in order to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.</p>\n<p>Among the nine underground tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 kilotons, 1962), Kennebec (&lt;5 kilotons, 1963), Par (38, kilotons, 1964), Barbel (&lt;20 kilotons, 1964), Tweed (&lt;20 kilotons, 1965), Cyclamen (13 kilotons, 1966), Kankakee (20-200 kilotons, 1966), Vulcan (25 kilotons, 1966) and Hutch (20-200 kilotons, 1969), the last one was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates. The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4×10 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4&nbsp;kg rock picked up 7 days after the test. This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. In order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter, through the shafts, to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in the Anacostia and Kennebec tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling; whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.</p>\n<p>Although no new elements (apart from einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories. So 6×10 atoms of Fm could be recovered after the Hutch detonation. They were then used in the studies of thermal-neutron induced fission of Fm and in discovery of a new fermium isotope Fm. Also the rare Cm isotope was synthesized in large quantities, which is very difficult to produce in nuclear reactors from its progenitor Cm – the half-life of Cm (64 minutes) is much too short for months-long reactor irradiations, but is very \"long\" on the explosion timescale.</p>\n<h2>Natural occurrence</h2>\n<p>Because of the short half-life of all isotopes of fermium, all primordial fermium, that is fermium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only within a few months from the time of the synthesis. Einsteinium and fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.</p>\n<h2>Chemistry</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nA fermium-ytterbium alloy used for measuring the enthalpy of vaporization of fermium metal.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The chemistry of fermium has only been studied in solution using tracer techniques, and no solid compounds have been prepared. Under normal conditions, fermium exists in solution as the Fm ion, which has a hydration number of 16.9 and an acid dissociation constant of 1.6×10 (p<i>K</i>&nbsp;= 3.8). Fm forms complexes with a wide variety of organic ligands with hard donor atoms such as oxygen, and these complexes are usually more stable than those of the preceding actinides. It also forms anionic complexes with ligands such as chloride or nitrate and, again, these complexes appear to be more stable than those formed by einsteinium or californium. It is believed that the bonding in the complexes of the later actinides is mostly ionic in character: the Fm ion is expected to be smaller than the preceding An ions because of the higher effective nuclear charge of fermium, and hence fermium would be expected to form shorter and stronger metal–ligand bonds.</p>\n<p>Fermium(III) can be fairly easily reduced to fermium(II), for example with samarium(II) chloride, with which fermium coprecipitates. The electrode potential has been estimated to be similar to that of the ytterbium(III)/(II) couple, or about −1.15&nbsp;V with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode, a value which agrees with theoretical calculations. The Fm/Fm couple has an electrode potential of −2.37(10)&nbsp;V based on polarographic measurements.</p>\n<h2>Toxicity</h2>\n<p>Although few people come in contact with fermium, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has set annual exposure limits for the two most stable isotopes. For fermium-253, the ingestion limit was set at 10 Becquerels (1 Bq is equivalent to one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 10 Bq; for fermium-257, at 10 Bq and 4000 Bq respectively.</p>\n<h2>Notes and references</h2>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   The discovery of Fm is considered \"unproven\" in NUBASE&nbsp;2003.</li>\n<li>^ All isotopes of elements Z &gt; 100 can only be produced by accelerator-based nuclear reactions with charged particles and can be obtained only in tracer quantities (e.g., 1 million atoms for Md (Z = 101) per hour of irradiation (see reference 1 below)).</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^         Silva, Robert J.

  "title": "Mendelevium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Mendelevium</b> is a synthetic element with the symbol <b>Md</b> (formerly <b>Mv</b>) and the atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic element in the actinide series, mendelevium is usually synthesized by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles. It was named after Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, who created the Periodic Table. Mendeleev's periodic system is the fundamental way to classify all the chemical elements. The name \"mendelevium\" was accepted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1955 with symbol \"Mv\", which was changed to \"Md\" in the next IUPAC General Assembly (Paris, 1957).</p>\n\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Researchers have shown that mendelevium has a moderately stable dipositive (II) oxidation state in addition to the more characteristic (for actinide elements) tripositive (III) oxidation state, the latter being the more dominantly exhibited state in an aqueous solution (chromatography being the process used). Sometimes, mendelevium can even be shown to exhibit a monopositive (I) state. Md has been used to find out some of the chemical properties of this element while in an aqueous solution. There are no other known uses of mendelevium and only trace amounts of the element have ever been produced. Other isotopes of mendelevium, all radioactive, have been discovered, with Md being the most stable with a two-month half-life (about 55 days). Other isotopes range from 248 to 258 mass numbers and half-lives from a few seconds to about 51 days. The original Md had a half-life of 87 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Radioactivity</h3>\n<p>The trivalent element is radioactive. It was expected that the reaction would beEs (α,n) Md, where Md was α-active with a t of 5 minutes and the corresponding α-energy. No such α-activity was observed, but the 101 fraction showed spontaneous fission representing a t less than 3 hours. Because spontaneous fission was also observed in the fraction containing fermium, the α-bombardment of Es produced Md. The latter underwent electron capture to become Fm, which then decayed by spontaneous fission. So Fm was produced by the decays of cyclotron-synthesized mendelevium.</p>\n<h3>Metallic state</h3>\n<p>Johansson and Rosengren predicted in 1975 that Md would prefer a divalent metallic state, similar to europium (Eu) and ytterbium (Yb), rather than a trivalent one. Thermochromatographic studies conducted with trace amounts of Md concluded that Md forms a divalent metal. With the aid of empirical correlation method, a divalent metallic radius of (0.194 ± 0.010) nm has been estimated. The estimated enthalpy of sublimation is in the range of 134-142 kJ/mol.</p>\n<h3>Solution chemistry</h3>\n<p>Before the actual discovery of mendelevium, the trivalent state was the most stable one in aqueous solution. Accordingly, a similar chemical behavior to the other 3+ actinides and lanthanides was expected. The elution of Md just before Fm in the elution sequence of the trivalent actinides from the cation-exchange resin column, confirmed this prediction. Afterwards, Md in the form of insoluble hydroxides and fluorides that are quantitatively coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanides was found. The cation-exchange resin column as well as the HDEHP solvent extraction column elution date is consistent with a trivalent state for Md and an ionic radius smaller than Fm. An ionic radius of 0.0192&nbsp;nm and a coordination number of 6 for Md was predicted using empirical correlations. Using the known ionic radii for the trivalent rare earths and the linear correlation of log distribution coefficient with ionic radius, an average ionic radius of 0.089&nbsp;nm was estimated for Md and a heat of hydration of –(3654 ± 12) kJ/mol calculated using empirical models and the Born-Haber cycle. In reducing conditions, an anomalous chemical behavior of Md was found. Coprecipitation with BaSO and solvent extraction chromatography experiments using HDEHP were carried out in different reducing agents. These showed that Md could easily be reduced to a stable Md in aqueous solution. Mendelevium can also be reduced to the monovalent state in water-ethanol solutions. The cocrystallization of Md with salts of divalent ions is due to the formation of mixed crystals. For Md, an ionic radius of 0.117&nbsp;nm was found. The oxidation of Md to Md was rather unsuccessful.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Mendelevium (for Dimitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, surname commonly transliterated into Latin script as Mendeleev, Mendeleyev, Mendeléef, or even Mendelejeff, and first name sometimes transliterated as Dmitry or Dmitriy) was first synthesized by Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, Gregory R. Choppin, Bernard G. Harvey, and Stanley G. Thompson (team leader) in early 1955 at the University of California, Berkeley. The team produced Md (half-life of 87 minutes) when they bombarded an Es target with alpha particles (helium nuclei) in the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory's 60-inch cyclotron (Md was the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time). Element 101 was the ninth transuranic element synthesized. The first 17 atoms of this element were created and analyzed using the ion-exchange adsorption-elution method. During the process, mendelevium behaved very much like thulium, its naturally occurring homologue.</p>\n<h2>Discovery in detail</h2>\n<p>The discovery was based on a grand total of only 17 atoms. It is synthesized via the Es (α,n) 101 reaction in the 60-Inch-Cyclotron (= 152&nbsp;cm) at Berkeley (California). The target can be produced by irradiation of lighter isotopes as plutonium in the Materials Testing Reactor at the Arco Reactor Station in Idaho. Remarkable is that this target consisted of only 10 atoms of highly radioactive Es (with a half-life of 20.5 days). By elution through a calibrated cation exchange resin column, mendelevium was separated and chemically identified.</p>\n<h3>Determining feasibility</h3>\n<p>To predict if this method would be possible, they made use of a rough calculation. The number of atoms that would be produced, would be approximately equal to the number of atoms of target material times its cross section times the ion beam intensity times the time of bombardment related to the half-life of the product when bombarding for a time of the order of its half-life). This gave 1 atom per experiment. Thus under optimum conditions, the preparation of only one atom of element 101 per experiment could be expected. This calculation demonstrated that it was feasible to go ahead with the experiment.</p>\n<h3>Recoil technique</h3>\n<p>The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the target element was placed on the opposite side of the target from the beam and caught the recoiling atoms on a catcher foil. This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which is absolutely necessary when working with such a rare product as the einsteinium target material.</p>\n<p>The recoil target consisted of 10 of Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil (also Be, Al and Pt can be used). It was bombarded by 41 eV α-particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6∙10 particles per second over an area of 0.05&nbsp;cm. The target was cooled by water or liquid helium. The use of helium, in a gaseous atmosphere, slowed down the recoil atoms. This gas could be pumped out of the reaction chamber through a small orifice to form a ‘gas-jet’. Some fraction of the nonvolatile product atoms carried along with the gas, were deposited permanently on the foil surface. The foil could be removed periodically and a new foil could be installed. The next reaction was used for the mendelevium discovery experiment: Es + He → Md + n.</p>\n<h3>Purification and isolation</h3>\n<p>The removal of the Md atoms from the collector foil was done by acid etching or total dissolution of the thin gold foil. They can be purified and isolated from other product activities by several techniques. Separation of trivalent actinides from lanthanide fission products and La carrier can be done by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with HCl as eluant. To separate Md rapidly from the catcher foil, an anion-exchange chromatography using 6M HCl as eluant can be used. The gold remained on the column while the Md and other actinides passed through. A final isolation of Md from other trivalent actinides was also required. To separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101, a cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with ammonium salts was used. A chemical identification was made on the basis of its elution position just before Fm. In series of repetitive experiments, they made use of the eluant: α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB). Using the ‘gas-jet’ method, the first two steps can be eliminated. There was shown that in this method it is possible to transport and collect individual product atoms in a fraction of a second some tens of meters away from the target area. Effective transport over long distances requires the presence of large clusters (KCl aerosols) in the ‘carrier’ gas. It is used frequently in the production and isolation of transeinsteinium elements.</p>\n<p>Another possible way to separate the 3+ actinides can be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and HNO as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation-exchange resin column. The Md separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column. The disadvantage of this method is that Md elutes after Fm late in the sequence.</p>\n<h3>The first \"Hooray!\"</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe data sheet, showing stylus tracing and notes, that proved the discovery of mendelevium.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>There was no direct detection, but by observation of spontaneous fission events arising from its electron-capture daughter Fm. These events were recorded during the night of February 19, 1955. The first one was identified with a \"hooray\" followed by a \"double hooray\" and a \"triple hooray\". The fourth one eventually officially proved the chemical identification of the 101st element, mendelevium. Additional analysis and further experimentation, showed the isotope to have mass 256 and to decay by electron capture with a half-life of 1.5 h.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of mendelevium</div>\n<p>Sixteen isotopes of mendelevium from mass 245 to 260 have been characterized, with the most stable being Md with a half-life of 51.5 days, Md with a half-life of 31.8 days, and Md with a half-life of 5.52 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 97 minutes, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5 minutes. This element also has 5 meta states, with the longest-lived being Md (t = 58 minutes). The isotopes of mendelevium range in atomic weight from 245.091 u (Md) to 260.104 u (Md).</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Chemistry, International Union of Pure and Applied (1955).

  "title": "Nobelium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Nobelium</b> is a synthetic element with the symbol <b>No</b> and atomic number 102. It was first correctly identified in 1966 by scientists at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna, Soviet Union. Little is known about the element but limited chemical experiments have shown that it forms a stable divalent ion in solution as well as the predicted trivalent ion that is associated with its presence as one of the actinides.</p>\n\n<h2>Discovery profile</h2>\n<p>The discovery of element 102 was first announced by physicists at the Nobel Institute in Sweden in 1957. The team reported that they created an isotope with a half-life of 10 minutes, decaying by emission of an 8.5 MeV alpha particle, after bombarding Cm with C nuclei. The activity was assigned to No or No. The scientists proposed the name <i>nobelium</i> (No) for the new element. Later they retracted their claim and associated the activity to background effects.</p>\n<p>The synthesis of element 102 was then claimed in April 1958 at the University of California, Berkeley by Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, John R. Walton and Torbjørn Sikkeland. The team used the new heavy-ion linear accelerator (HILAC) to bombard a curium target (95% Cm and 5% Cm) with C and C ions. They were unable to confirm the 8.5 MeV activity claimed by the Swedes but were instead able to detect decays from Fm, supposedly the daughter of 102, which had an apparent half-life of ~3 s. In 1959 the team continued their studies and claimed that they were able to produce an isotope that decayed predominantly by emission of an 8.3 MeV alpha particle, with a half-life of 3 s with an associated 30% spontaneous fission branch. The activity was initially assigned to No but later changed to No. The Berkeley team decided to adopt the name <i>nobelium</i> for the element.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>244\n96Cm + 12\n6C → 256\n102No* → 252\n102No + 4 1\n0n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Further work in 1961 on the attempted synthesis of element 103 produced evidence for a Z=102 alpha activity decaying by emission of an 8.2 MeV particle with a half-life of 15 s, and assigned to No.</p>\n<p>Following initial work between 1958–1964, in 1966, a team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR) reported that they had been able to detect Fm from the decay of a parent nucleus (No) with a half-life of ~50s, in contradiction to the Berkeley claim. Furthermore, they were able to show that the parent decayed by emission of 8.1 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of ~35 s.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>238\n92U + 22\n10Ne → 260\n102No* → 254\n102No + 6 1\n0n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1969, the Dubna team carried out chemical experiments on element 102 and concluded that it behaved as the heavier homologue of ytterbium. The Russian scientists proposed the name <i>joliotium</i> (Jo) for the new element.</p>\n<p>Later work in 1967 at Berkeley and 1971 at Oak Ridge fully confirmed the discovery of element 102 and clarified earlier observations.</p>\n<p>In 1992, the IUPAC-IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that only the Dubna work from 1966 correctly detected and assigned decays to Z=102 nuclei at the time. The Dubna team are therefore officially recognised as the discoverers of nobelium although it is possible that it was detected at Berkeley in 1959.</p>\n<h2>Naming</h2>\n<p>Element 102 was first named <i>nobelium</i> (No) by its claimed discoverers in 1957 by scientists at the Nobel Institute in Sweden. The name was later adopted by Berkeley scientists who claimed its discovery in 1959.</p>\n<p>The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially recognised the name <i>nobelium</i> following the Berkeley results.</p>\n<p>In 1994, and subsequently in 1997, the IUPAC ratified the name <i>nobelium</i> (No) for the element on the basis that it had become entrenched in the literature over the course of 30 years and that Alfred Nobel should be commemorated in this fashion.</p>\n<h2>Physical properties</h2>\n<p>The appearance of this element is unknown, however it is most likely silvery-white or gray and metallic. If sufficient amounts of nobelium were produced, it would pose a radiation hazard. Some sources quote a melting point of 827 °C for nobelium but this cannot be substantiated from an official source and seems implausible regarding the requirements of such a measurement. However, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd ionization energies have been measured. In addition, an electronegativity value of 1.3 is also sometimes quoted.</p>\n<h2>Experimental chemistry</h2>\n<h3>Aqueous phase chemistry</h3>\n<p>First experiments involving nobelium assumed that it predominantly formed a +III state like earlier actinoids. However, it was later found that nobelium forms a stable +II state in solution, although it can be oxidized to the +III state. The ionic radii were estimated at 110 pm for No and 90 pm for No.</p>\n<h3>Summary of compounds and (complex) ions</h3>\n\n<h2>Nucleosynthesis</h2>\n<h3>By cold fusion</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Pb(Ca,xn)No (x=1,2,3,4)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This cold fusion reaction was first studied in 1979 at the FLNR.

The latter activity was later assigned to a K-isomer in No. The reaction was reported in 2006 by Peterson et al. at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in a study of SF inNo. They detected two activities with half-lives of 3.7&nbsp;µs and 43&nbsp;µs and both assigned to No, the latter associated with a K-isomer.</p>\n<h2>By hot fusion</h2>\n<dl>\n<dt>Th(Mg,xn)No (x=4,5,6)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The cross sections for the 4-6n exit channels have been measured for this reaction at the FLNR.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>U(Ne,xn)No (x=4,5,6)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was first studied in 1964 at the FLNR.

They were also able to detect a 10 s spontaneous fission activity also tentatively assigned to 102. Further work in 1966 on the reaction examined the detection of Fm decay using chemical separation and a parent activity with a half-life of ~50 s was reported and correctly assigned to 102. They also detected a 10 s spontaneous fission activity tentatively assigned to 102. The reaction was used in 1969 to study some initial chemistry of nobelium at the FLNR. They determined eka-ytterbium properties, consistent with nobelium as the heavier homologue. In 1970, they were able to study the SF properties of No. In 2002, Patin et al. reported the synthesis of No from the 4n channel but were unable to detect No.</p>\n<p>The cross section values for the 4-6n channels have also been studied at the FLNR.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>U(Ne,xn)No</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was studied in 1964 at the FLNR.

Observations to date are summarised in the table below:</p>\n\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of nobelium</div>\n<p>Twelve radioisotopes of nobelium have been characterized, with the most stable being No with a half-life of 58 minutes. Longer half-lives are expected for the as-yet-unknown No and No. An isomeric level has been found in No and K-isomers have been found in No, No and No to date.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Chronology of isotope discovery</dt>\n</dl>\n\n<h3>Nuclear isomerism</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>No</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The study of K-isomerism was recently studied by physicists at the University of Jyväskylä physics laboratory (JYFL). They were able to confirm a previously reported K-isomer and detected a second K-isomer. They assigned spins and parities of 8 and 16 to the two K-isomers.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>No</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In the early 1970s, Bemis <i>et al.</i> determined an isomeric level decaying with a half-life of 31 µs from the decay of Rf. This was confirmed in 2003 at the GSI by also studying the decay of Rf. Further support in the same year from the FLNR appeared with a slightly higher half-life of 43.5 µs, decaying by M2 gamma emission to the ground state.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>No</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In a recent study by the GSI into K-isomerism in even-even isotopes, a K-isomer with a half-life of 110 ms was detected for No. A spin and parity of 8 was assigned to the isomer.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>No</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In 2003, scientists at the FLNR reported that they had been able to synthesise No which decayed by SF with a half-life of 54µs. Further work in 2006 by scientists at the ANL showed that the activity was actually due to a K-isomer in No. The ground state isomer was also detected with a very short half-life of 3.7 µs.</p>\n<h3>Retracted isotopes</h3>\n<p>In 2003, scientists at the FLNR claimed to have discovered the lightest known isotope of nobelium. However, subsequent work showed that the 54 µs activity was actually due to No and the isotope No was retracted.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   Lide, D. R., ed. (2003).

In the periodic table of the elements, it is a period 7 d-block element and the last element of the actinide series. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium behaves as the heavier homologue to lutetium and is chemically similar to other actinides.</p>\n<p>Lawrencium was first synthesized by the nuclear-physics team led by Albert Ghiorso on February 14, 1961, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory of the University of California. The first atoms of lawrencium were produced by bombarding a three-milligram target consisting of three isotopes of the element californium with boron-10 and boron-11 nuclei from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator.

All its isotopes except for lawrencium-260, -261 and -262 decay with a half-life of less than a minute.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n<p>Lawrencium was first synthesized by the nuclear-physics team of Albert Ghiorso, Torbjørn Sikkeland, Almon Larsh, Robert M. Latimer, and their co-workers on February 14, 1961, at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (now called the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) at the University of California. The first atoms of lawrencium were produced by bombarding a three-milligram target consisting of three isotopes of the element californium with boron-10 and boron-11 nuclei from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC). The Berkeley team reported that the isotope Lr was detected in this manner, and that it decayed by emitting an 8.6 MeV alpha particle with a half-life of about eight seconds. This identification was later corrected to be Lr.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>252\n98Cf + 11\n5B → 263–x\n103Lr → 258\n103Lr + 5 1\n0n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1967, nuclear-physics researchers in Dubna, Russia, reported that they were not able to confirm assignment of an alpha emitter with a half-life of eight seconds to Lr. This isotope was later deduced to be Lr. Instead, the Dubna team reported an isotope with a half-life of about 45 seconds as Lr.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>243\n95Am + 18\n8O → 261–x\n103Lr → 256\n103Lr + 5 1\n0n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Further experiments have demonstrated an actinide chemistry for the new element, so by 1970 it was known that lawrencium is the last actinide. In 1971, the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260.</p>\n<p>In 1992, the IUPAC Trans-fermium Working Group (TWG) officially recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium.</p>\n<h3>Naming</h3>\n<p>The origin of the name, ratified by the American Chemical Society, is in reference to the nuclear-physicist Ernest O. Lawrence, of the University of California, who invented the cyclotron particle accelerator. The symbol <b>Lw</b> was used originally, but the element was assigned the <b>Lr</b> symbol. In August 1997, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) ratified the name lawrencium and the symbol <b>Lr</b> during a meeting in Geneva.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<h3>Electronic structure</h3>\n<p>Lawrencium is element 103 in the periodic table. It is the first member of the 6d-block; in accordance with the Madelung rule, its electronic configuration should be [Rn]7s5f6d. However, results from quantum mechanical research have suggested that this configuration is incorrect, and is in fact [Rn]7s5f7p. A direct measurement of this is not possible. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the suggestion.</p>\n<p>A strict correlation between the periodic table blocks and the orbital-shell configurations for neutral atoms would classify lawrencium as a transition metal because it could be classed as a d-block element. However, lawrencium is classified as an actinide element according to the IUPAC recommendations.</p>\n<h3>Experimental chemical properties</h3>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<h4>Gaseous phase</h4>\n<p>The first gaseous-phase studies of lawrencium were reported in 1969 by a nuclear physics team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR) in the Soviet Union. They used the nuclear reaction Am+O to produce lawrencium nuclei, which they then exposed to a stream of chlorine gas, and a volatile chloride product was formed. This product was deduced to be LrCl, and this confirmed that lawrencium is a typical actinide element.</p>\n<h4>Aqueous phase</h4>\n<p>The first aqueous-phase studies of lawrencium were reported in 1970 by a nuclear physics team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. This team used the nuclear reaction Cf+B to produce lawrencium nuclei. They were able to show that lawrencium forms a trivalent ion, similar to those of the other actinide elements, but in contrast with that of nobelium. Further experiments in 1988 confirmed the formation of a trivalent lawrencium(III) ion using anion-exchange chromatography using α-hydroxy<i>iso</i>butyrate (α-HIB) complex. Comparison of the elution time with other actinides allowed a determination of 88.6 ± 0.3 picometers for the ionic radius for Lr. Attempts to reduce lawrencium in the lawrencium(III) ionization state to lawrencium(I) using the potent reducing agent hydroxylamine hydrochloride were unsuccessful.</p>\n<h2>Nucleosynthesis</h2>\n<h3>Fusion</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Tl(Ti,xn)Lr (x=2?)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was studied in a series of experiments in 1976 by Yuri Oganessian and his team at the FLNR.

The team at GANIL used the reaction in 2003 and the team at the FLNR used it between 2004 and 2006 to provide further information for the decay scheme of Lr. The work provided evidence for an isomeric level in Lr.</p>\n<h3>Hot fusion</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Am(O,xn)Lr (x=5)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was first studied in 1965 by the team at the FLNR. They were able to detect activity with a characteristic decay of 45 seconds, which was assigned to Lr or Lr. Later work suggests an assignment to Lr. Further studies in 1968 produced an 8.35–8.60 MeV alpha activity with a half-life of 35 seconds. This activity was also initially assigned to Lr or Lr and later to solely Lr.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Am(O,xn)Lr (x=4)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was studied in 1970 by the team at the FLNR. They were able to detect an 8.37 MeV alpha activity with a half-life of 22s.

It was also used to attempt to measure an electron capture (EC) branch in Rf from the 5n exit channel. After extraction of the Lr(III) component, they were able to measure the spontaneous fission of Lr with an improved half-life of 44 minutes. The production cross-section was 700 pb. On this basis, a 14% electron capture branch was calculated if this isotope was produced via the 5n channel rather than the p4n channel. A lower bombarding energy (93 MeV c.f. 97 MeV) was then used to measure the production of Lr in the p3n channel. The isotope was successfully detected and a yield of 240 pb was measured. The yield was lower than expected compared to the p4n channel. However, the results were judged to indicate that the Lr was most likely produced by a p3n channel and an upper limit of 14% for the electron capture branch of Rf was therefore suggested.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Cm(N,xn)Lr (x=3?)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was studied briefly in 1958 at the LBNL using an enriched Cm target (5% Cm).

A total of 23 alpha decays were measured for Lr, with a mean energy of 8.03 MeV and an improved half-life of 2.7 minutes. The calculated cross-section was 8.7 nb.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Cf(B,xn)Lr (x=5,7??)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was first studied in 1961 at the University of California by Albert Ghiorso by using a californium target (52% Cf). They observed three alpha activities of 8.6, 8.4 and 8.2 MeV, with half-lives of about 8 and 15 seconds, respectively. The 8.6 MeV activity was tentatively assigned to Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to Lr, resulting from the 5n exit channel. The 8.4 MeV activity was also assigned to Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to Lr. This is most likely from the 33% Cf component in the target rather than from the 7n channel. The 8.2 MeV was subsequently associated with nobelium.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Cf(B,xn)Lr (x=4,6)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was first studied in 1961 at the University of California by Albert Ghiorso by using a californium target (52% Cf). They observed three alpha activities of 8.6, 8.4 and 8.2 MeV, with half-lives of about 8 and 15 seconds, respectively. The 8.6 MeV activity was tentatively assigned to Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to Lr. The 8.4 MeV activity was also assigned to Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to Lr. The 8.2 MeV was subsequently associated with nobelium.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Cf(N,αxn)Lr (x=3)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was studied in 1971 at the LBNL. They were able to identify a 0.7 s alpha activity with two alpha lines at 8.87 and 8.82 MeV. This was assigned to Lr.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Cf(B,xn)Lr (x=4)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was first studied in 1970 at the LBNL in an attempt to study the aqueous chemistry of lawrencium. They were able to measure a Lr activity.

The reaction was repeated in 1976 at Oak Ridge and the synthesis of Lr was confirmed.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Es + Ne – transfer</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was studied in 1987 at the LLNL. They were able to detect new spontaneous fission (SF) activities assigned to Lr and Lr, resulting from transfer from the Ne nuclei to the Es target. In addition, a 5 ms SF activity was detected in delayed coincidence with nobelium K-shell X-rays and was assigned to No, resulting from the electron capture of Lr.</p>\n<h3>Decay products</h3>\n<p>Isotopes of lawrencium have also been identified in the decay of heavier elements. Observations to date are summarised in the table below:</p>\n\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of lawrencium</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Eleven isotopes of lawrencium plus one isomer have been synthesized with Lr being the longest-lived and the heaviest, with a half-life of 216 minutes.

Analysis of the data indicated the population of two isomeric levels in Lr from the decay of the corresponding isomers in Db. The ground state was assigned spin and parity of 7/2-, decaying by emission of an 8794 KeV alpha particle with a half-life of 0.57s. The isomeric level was assigned spin and parity of 1/2-, decaying by emission of an 8722 KeV alpha particle with a half-life of 1.49 s.</p>\n<p>Recent work on the spectroscopy of Lr formed in the reaction Bi(Ca,2n)Lr has provided evidence for an isomeric level.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^   Silva, p. 1641.</li>\n<li>^ Emsley, John (2001).

  "title": "Rutherfordium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Rutherfordium</b> is a chemical element with symbol <b>Rf</b> and atomic number 104, named in honor of physicist Ernest Rutherford. It is a synthetic element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, Rf, has a half-life of approximately 1.3&nbsp;hours.</p>\n<p>In the periodic table of the elements, it is a d-block element and the first of the period 4 transition elements. It is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 4 elements. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homologue to hafnium in group 4. The chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized only partly. They compare well with the chemistry of the other group 4 elements, even though some calculations had indicated that the element might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, small amounts of rutherfordium were produced in laboratories in the former Soviet Union and in California. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established rutherfordium as the official name for the element.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n<p>Rutherfordium was reportedly first detected in 1964 at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research at Dubna (then in the Soviet Union). Researchers there bombarded a plutonium-242 target with neon-22 ions and separated the reaction products by gradient thermochromatography after conversion to chlorides by interaction with ZrCl. The team identified spontaneous fission activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka-hafnium properties. Although a half-life was not accurately determined, later calculations indicated that the product was most likely rutherfordium-259 (abbreviated as Rf in standard notation):</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>242\n94Pu + 22\n10Ne → 264−x\n104Rf → 264−x\n104RfCl</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1969, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley conclusively synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with carbon-12 ions and measured the alpha decay of Rf, correlated with the daughter decay of nobelium-253:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>249\n98Cf + 12\n6C → 257\n104Rf + 4 n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The American synthesis was independently confirmed in 1973 and secured the identification of rutherfordium as the parent by the observation of K-alpha X-rays in the elemental signature of the Rf decay product, nobelium-253.</p>\n<h3>Naming controversy</h3>\n<div>Main article: Element naming controversy</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>The 104th element was eventually named after Ernest Rutherford (left side) (1871–1937), a British-New Zealand chemist and physicist who became known as the father of nuclear physics. The element was initially proposed to be named after Igor Kurchatov (right side) (1903–1960), a Soviet nuclear physicist who is remembered as \"The Father of the Soviet Atomic Bomb\".</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The Russian scientists proposed the name <i>kurchatovium</i> and the American scientists suggested the name <i>rutherfordium</i> for the new element. In 1992, the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that both teams provided contemporaneous evidence to the synthesis of element 104 and that credit should be shared between the two groups.</p>\n<p>The American group wrote a scathing response to the findings of the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that this was not the case and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (<i>rutherfordium</i>) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.</p>\n<p>As a consequence of the initial competing claims of discovery, an element naming controversy arose. Since the Soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name <i>kurchatovium</i>, Ku, in honor of Igor Kurchatov (1903–1960), former head of Soviet nuclear research. This name had been used in books of the Soviet Bloc as the official name of the element. The Americans, however, proposed <i>rutherfordium</i> (Rf) for the new element to honor Ernest Rutherford, who is known as the \"father\" of nuclear physics. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted <i>unnilquadium</i>, Unq, as a temporary, systematic element name, derived from the Latin names for digits 1, 0, and 4. In 1994, IUPAC suggested the name <i>dubnium</i> to be used since <i>rutherfordium</i> was suggested for element 106 and IUPAC felt that the Dubna team should be rightly recognized for their contributions. However, there was still a dispute over the names of elements 104–107. In 1997 the teams involved resolved the dispute and adopted the current name <i>rutherfordium</i>. The name <i>dubnium</i> was given to element 105 at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Nucleosynthesis</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of rutherfordium</div>\n<p>Super-heavy elements such as rutherfordium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induces fusion reactions. Whereas most of the isotopes of rutherfordium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers.</p>\n<p>Depending on the energies involved, the former are separated into \"hot\" and \"cold\". In hot fusion reactions, very light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets (actinides), giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40–50 MeV) that may either fission or evaporate several (3 to 5) neutrons. In cold fusion reactions, the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy (~10–20 MeV), which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the ground state, they require emission of only one or two neutrons, and thus, allows for the generation of more neutron-rich products. The latter is a distinct concept from that of where nuclear fusion claimed to be achieved at room temperature conditions (see cold fusion).</p>\n<h3>Hot fusion studies</h3>\n<p>The synthesis of rutherfordium was first attempted in 1964 by the team at Dubna using the hot fusion reaction of neon-22 projectiles with plutonium-242 targets:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>242\n94Pu + 22\n10Ne → 264-x\n104Rf + 3 or 5 n.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The first study produced evidence for a spontaneous fission with a 0.3&nbsp;second half-life and another one at 8&nbsp;seconds. While the former observation was eventually retracted, the latter eventually became associated with the Rf isotope. In 1966, the Soviet team repeated the experiment using a chemical study of volatile chloride products. They identified a volatile chloride with eka-hafnium properties that decayed fast through spontaneous fission. This gave strong evidence for the formation of RfCl, and although a half-life was not accurately measured, later evidence suggested that the product was most likely Rf. The team repeated the experiment several times over the next few years, and in 1971, they revised the spontaneous fission half time for the isotope at 4.5&nbsp;seconds.</p>\n<p>In 1969, researchers at the University of California led by Albert Ghiorso, tried to confirm the original results reported at Dubna. In a reaction of curium-248 with oxygen-16, they were unable to confirm the result of the Soviet team, but managed to observe the spontaneous fission of Rf with a very short half-life of 10–30 ms:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>248\n96Cm + 16\n8O → 260\n104Rf + 4 n.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1970, the American team also studied the same reaction with oxygen-18 and identified Rf with a half-life of 65&nbsp;seconds (later refined to 75&nbsp;seconds). Later experiments at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California also revealed the formation of a short-lived isomer of Rf (which undergoes spontaneous fission with a half-life of 47&nbsp;ms), and spontaneous fission activities with long lifetimes tentatively assigned to Rf.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nDiagram of the experimental set-up used in the discovery of isotopes Rf and Rf</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The reaction of californium-249 with carbon-13 was also investigated by the Ghiorso team, which indicated the formation of the short-lived Rf (which undergoes spontaneous fission in 11&nbsp;ms):</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>249\n98Cf + 13\n6C → 258\n104Rf + 4 n.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In trying to confirm these results by using carbon-12 instead, they also observed the first alpha decays from Rf.</p>\n<p>The reaction of berkelium-249 with nitrogen-14 was first studied in Dubna in 1977, and in 1985, researchers there confirmed the formation of the Rf isotope which quickly undergoes spontaneous fission in 28&nbsp;ms:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>249\n97Bk + 14\n7N → 260\n104Rf + 3 n.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1996 the isotope Rf was observed in LBNL from the fusion of plutonium-244 with neon-22:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>244\n94Pu + 22\n10Ne → 266-x\n104Rf + 4 or 5 n.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The team determined a half-life of 2.1&nbsp;seconds, in contrast to earlier reports of 47&nbsp;ms and suggested that the two half-lives might be due to different isomeric states of Rf. Studies on the same reaction by a team at Dubna, lead to the observation in 2000 of alpha decays from Rf and spontaneous fissions of Rf.</p>\n<p>The hot fusion reaction using a uranium target was first reported at Dubna in 2000:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>238\n92U + 26\n12Mg → 264-x\n104Rf + x n (x = 3, 4, 5, 6).</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>They observed decays from Rf and Rf, and later for Rf. In 2006, as part of their program on the study of uranium targets in hot fusion reactions, the team at LBNL also observed Rf.</p>\n<h3>Cold fusion studies</h3>\n<p>The first cold fusion experiments involving element 104 were done in 1974 at Dubna, by using light titanium-50 nuclei aimed at lead-208 isotope targets:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>208\n82Pb + 50\n22Ti → 258-x\n104Rf + x n (x = 1, 2, or 3).</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The measurement of a spontaneous fission activity was assigned to Rf, while later studies done at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung Institute (GSI), also measured decay properties for the isotopes Rf, and Rf.</p>\n<p>In 1974 researchers at Dubna investigated the reaction of lead-207 with titanium-50 to produce the isotope Rf. In a 1994 study at GSI using the lead-206 isotope, Rf as well as Rf were detected. Rf was similarly detected that year when lead-204 was used instead.</p>\n<h3>Decay studies</h3>\n<p>Most isotopes with an atomic mass below 262 have also observed as decay products of elements with a higher atomic number, allowing for refinement of their previously measured properties. Heavier isotopes of rutherfordium have only been observed as decay products. For example, a few alpha decay events terminating in Rf were observed in the decay chain of darmstadtium-279 since 2004:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>279\n110Ds → 275\n108Hs + α → 271\n106Sg + α → 267\n104Rf + α.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This further underwent spontaneous fission with a half-time of about 1.3 h.</p>\n<p>Investigations on the synthesis of the dubnium-263 isotope in 1999 at the University of Bern revealed events consistent with electron capture to form Rf. A rutherfordium fraction was separated, and several spontaneous fission events with long lifetimes of about 15 minutes were observed, as well as and alpha decays with lifetimes of about 10 minutes. Reports on the decay chain of flerovium-285 in 2010 showed five sequential alpha decays that terminate in Rf, which further undergoes spontaneous fission with a life-time of 152 seconds.</p>\n<p>Some experimental evidence was obtained in 2004 for an even heavier isotope, Rf, in the decay chain of an isotope of ununpentium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>288\n115Uup → 284\n113Uut + α → 280\n111Rg + α → 276\n109Mt + α → 272\n107Bh + α → 268\n105Db + α&nbsp;? → 268\n104Rf + ν\ne.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>However, the last step in this chain was uncertain. After observing the five alpha decay events that generate dubnium-268, spontaneous fission events were observed with a long half-time. It is unclear whether these events were due to direct spontaneous fission of Db, or Db produced electron capture events with long half-times to generate Rf. If the latter is produced and decays with a short life-time, the two possibilities cannot be distinguished. Given that the electron capture of Db cannot be detected, these spontaneous fission events may be due to Rf, in which case the half-life of this isotope cannot be extracted.</p>\n<p>According to a 2007 report on the synthesis of ununtrium, the isotope 113 was observed to undergo a similar decay to form Db, which undergoes spontaneous fission with a half-life of 22 minutes. Given that the electron capture of Db cannot be detected, these spontaneous fission events may be due to Rf, in which case the half-life of this isotope cannot be extracted.<br></p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of rutherfordium</div>\n<p>Rutherfordium has no stable or naturally-occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Fifteen different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 253 to 268 (with the exception of 264). Most of these decay predominantly through spontaneous fission pathways.</p>\n<h3>Life-times</h3>\n<p>The lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 50 μs for Rf and Rf were observed. Rf, Rf, Rf are more stable at around 10 ms, Rf, Rf, Rf, and Rf live between 1 and 5 seconds, and Rf, Rf, and Rf are more stable, at around 1, 1.5, and 10 min respectively. The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with Rf having a measured half-life of about 1.3 h.</p>\n<p>The lightest isotopes were synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is Rf; heavier isotopes have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers, of which only Rf has been confirmed. Isotopes Rf and Rf may have also been observed as decay products and are thought to have long half-lives of 10 h and 6 h, respectively—but these have been measured indirectly, through systematic studies. While the isotope Rf has yet to be observed, it is predicted to have a long half-life of 1 h. Before its discovery, Rf was predicted to have an even longer half-life of 13 h, but it has a half-life of only 2.5 min.</p>\n<p>In 1999, American scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 118. These parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted seven alpha particles to form Rf nuclei, but their claim was retracted in 2001.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear isomerism</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nCurrently suggested decay level scheme for Rf from the studies reported in 2007 by Hessberger <i>et al.</i> at GSI</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Several early studies on the synthesis of Rf have indicated that this nuclide decays primarily by spontaneous fission with a half-life of 10–20 minutes. More recently, a study of hassium isotopes allowed the synthesis of atoms of Rf decaying with a shorter half-life of 8 seconds. These two different decay modes must be associated with two isomeric states, but specific assignments are difficult due to the low number of observed events.</p>\n<p>During research on the synthesis of rutherfordium isotopes utilizing the Pu(Ne,5n)Rf reaction, the product was found to undergo exclusive 8.28 MeV alpha decay with a half-life of 78 seconds. Later studies at GSI on the synthesis of copernicium and hassium isotopes produced conflicting data, as Rf produced in the decay chain was found to undergo 8.52 MeV alpha decay with a half-life of 4 seconds. Later results indicated a predominant fission branch. These contradictions led to some doubt on the discovery of copernicium. The first isomer is currently denoted Rf (or simply Rf) whilst the second is denoted Rf (or Rf). However, it is thought that the first nucleus belongs to a high-spin ground state and the latter to a low-spin metastable state. The discovery and confirmation of Rf provided proof for the discovery of copernicium in 1996.</p>\n<p>A detailed spectroscopic study of the production of Rf nuclei using the reaction Pb(Ti,n)Rf allowed the identification of an isomeric level in Rf. The work confirmed that Rf has a complex spectrum with 15 alpha lines. A level structure diagram was calculated for both isomers. Similar isomers were reported for Rf also.</p>\n<h2>Predicted properties</h2>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<p>Rutherfordium is the first transactinide element and the second member of the 6d series of transition metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials, atomic radius, as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of hafnium and very different from that of lead. Therefore it was concluded that rutherfordium's basic properties will resemble those of other group 4 elements, below titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase experiments and aqueous chemistry. The oxidation state +4 is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable +4 state. In addition, rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable +3 state.</p>\n<p>The chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculation which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the p orbitals have a lower energy level than the d orbitals, giving it an valence electron configuration of 6d 7s 7p or even 7s 7p, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that rutherfordium behaves according to the rest of the group 4 elements.</p>\n<p>In an analogous manner to zirconium and hafnium, rutherfordium is projected to form a very stable, high melting point oxide, RfO. It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase.</p>\n<p>In the aqueous phase, the Rf ion hydrolyzes less than titanium(IV) and to a similar extent as zirconium and hafnium, thus resulting in the RfO ion. Treatment of the halides with halide ions promotes the formation of complex ions. The use of chloride and bromide ions produces the hexahalide complexes RfCl2−\n6 and RfBr2−\n6. For the fluoride complexes, zirconium and hafnium tend to form hepta- and octa- complexes. Thus, for the larger rutherfordium ion, the complexes RfF2−\n6, RfF2−\n7 and RfF4−\n8 are possible.</p>\n<h3>Physical and atomic</h3>\n<p>Rutherfordium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 23&nbsp;g/cm; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61&nbsp;g/cm. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius for rutherfordium is expected to be around 150&nbsp;pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Rf and Rf ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.</p>\n<h2>Experimental chemistry</h2>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<h3>Gas phase</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe tetrahedral structure of the RfCl molecule</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Early work on the study of the chemistry of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope Rf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl) because its bonds are more covalent.</p>\n<p>A series of experiments confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as a typical member of group 4, forming a tetravalent chloride (RfCl) and bromide (RfBr) as well as an oxychloride (RfOCl). A decreased volatility was observed for RfCl\n4 when potassium chloride is provided as the solid phase instead of gas, highly indicative of the formation of nonvolatile K\n2RfCl\n6 mixed salt.</p>\n<h3>Aqueous phase</h3>\n<p>Rutherfordium is expected to have the electron configuration [Rn]5f 6d 7s and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions.</p>\n<p>The most conclusive aqueous chemistry studies of rutherfordium have been performed by the Japanese team at Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute using the radioisotope Rf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, hafnium, zirconium, and thorium have proved a non-actinide behavior for rutherfordium. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, in a manner similar to hafnium and zirconium.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>261mRf4+ + 6 Cl− → [RfCl\n6]2−</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Very similar results were observed in hydrofluoric acid solutions. Differences in the extraction curves were interpreted as a weaker affinity for fluoride ion and the formation of the hexafluororutherfordate ion, whereas hafnium and zirconium ions complex seven or eight fluoride ions at the concentrations used:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>261mRf4+ + 6 F− → [RfF\n6]2−</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^        Chemical Data.

  "html": "\n<p><b>Dubnium</b> is a chemical element with the symbol <b>Db</b> and atomic number 105, named after the town of Dubna in Russia, where it was first produced. It is a synthetic element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, dubnium-268, has a half-life of approximately 28 hours.</p>\n<p>In the periodic table of the elements, it is a d-block element and in the transactinide elements. It is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 5 element. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that dubnium behaves as the heavier homologue to tantalum in group 5. The chemical properties of dubnium are characterized only partly. They are similar with those of other group 5 elements.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, microscopic amounts of dubnium were produced in laboratories in the former Soviet Union and in California. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established dubnium as the official name for the element.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n<p>Dubnium was reportedly first discovered in 1968 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (then in the Soviet Union). Researchers there bombarded an americium-243 target with neon-22 ions. They reported a 9.40 MeV and a 9.70 MeV alpha-activity and assigned the decays to the isotope Db or Db:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>243\n95Am + 22\n10Ne → 265−x\n105Db + x n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Two years later the Dubna team separated their reaction products by thermal gradient chromatography after conversion to chlorides by interaction with NbCl. The team identified a 2.2 second spontaneous fission activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka-tantalum properties, likely dubnium-261 pentachloride, DbCl.</p>\n<p>In the same year, a team led by Albert Ghiorso working at the University of California, Berkeley conclusively synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with nitrogen-15 ions. The team published a convincing synthesis of Db in the reaction between californium-249 target and nitrogen-15 ions and measured the alpha decay of Db with a half-life of 1.6 seconds and a decay energy of 9.10 MeV, correlated with the daughter decay of lawrencium-256:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>249\n98Cf + 15\n7N → 260\n105Db + 4 n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These results by the Berkeley scientists did not confirm the Soviet findings regarding the 9.40 MeV or 9.70 MeV alpha-decay of dubnium-260, leaving only dubnium-261 as possible produced isotope. In 1971, the Dubna team repeated their reaction using an improved set-up and were able to confirm the decay data for Db using the reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>243\n95Am + 22\n10Ne → 260\n105Db + 5 n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1976, the Dubna team continued their study of the reaction using thermal gradient chromatography and were able to identify the product as dubnium-260 pentabromide, DbBr.</p>\n<p>In 1992 the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group assessed the claims of the two groups and concluded that confidence in the discovery grew from results from both laboratories and the claim of discovery should be shared.</p>\n<h3>Naming controversy</h3>\n<div>Main article: Element naming controversy</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>The element 105 was originally proposed to be named after Niels Bohr (left side), a Danish nuclear physicist, with name <i>nielsbohrium</i> (Ns) by the Soviet/Russian team. The American team initially proposed the element to be named after Otto Hahn (right side), a German chemist, known as a pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The Soviet, later Russian, team proposed the name <i>nielsbohrium</i> (Ns) in honor of the Danish nuclear physicist Niels Bohr. The American team proposed that the new element should be named <i>hahnium</i> (Ha), in honor of the late German chemist Otto Hahn. Consequently <i>hahnium</i> was the name that most American and Western European scientists used and appears in many papers published at the time, and <i>nielsbohrium</i> was used in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries.</p>\n<p>An element naming controversy erupted between the two groups. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) thus adopted <i>unnilpentium</i> (Unp) as a temporary, systematic element name. Attempting to resolve the issue, in 1994, the IUPAC proposed the name <i>joliotium</i> (Jl), after the French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie, which was originally proposed by Soviet team for element 102, later named nobelium. The two principal claimants still disagreed about the names of elements 104-106. However, in 1997 they resolved the dispute and adopted the current name, <i>dubnium</i> (Db), after the Russian town of Dubna, the location of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. It was argued by IUPAC that the Berkeley laboratory had already been recognized several times in the naming of elements (i.e., berkelium, californium, americium) and that the acceptance of the names <i>rutherfordium</i> and <i>seaborgium</i> for elements 104 and 106 should be offset by recognizing the Russian team's contributions to the discovery of elements 104, 105 and 106.</p>\n<h2>Chemical properties</h2>\n<h3>Extrapolated properties</h3>\n<p>Element 105 is projected to be the third member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group V in the Periodic Table, below vanadium, niobium and tantalum. Because it is positioned right below tantalum, it may also be called <i>eka-tantalum</i>. All the members of the group readily portray their oxidation state of +5 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus dubnium is expected to form a stable +5 state. For this group, +4 and +3 states are also known for the heavier members and dubnium may also form these reducing oxidation states.</p>\n<p>In an extrapolation of the chemistries from niobium and tantalum, dubnium should react with oxygen to form an inert pentoxide, DbO. In alkali, the formation of an orthodubnate complex, DbO3−\n4, is expected. Reaction with the halogens should readily form the pentahalides, DbX. The pentachlorides of niobium and tantalum exist as volatile solids or monomeric trigonal bipyramidal molecules in the vapour phase. Thus, DbCl is expected to be a volatile solid. Similarly, the pentafluoride, DbF, should be even more volatile. Hydrolysis of the halides is known to readily form the oxyhalides, MOX. Thus the halides DbX should react with water to form DbOX. The reaction with fluoride ion is also well known for the lighter homologues and dubnium is expected to form a range of fluoro-complexes. In particular, reaction of the pentafluoride with HF should form a hexafluorodubnate ion, DbF−\n6. Excess fluoride should lead to DbF2−\n7 and DbOF2−\n5. If eka-tantalum properties are portrayed, higher concentrations of fluoride should ultimately form DbF3−\n8 since NbF3−\n8 is not known.</p>\n<h3>Experimental chemistry</h3>\n<p>The chemistry of dubnium has been studied for several years using gas thermochromatography. The experiments have studied the relative adsorption characteristics of isotopes of niobium, tantalum and dubnium radioisotopes. The results have indicated the formation of typical group 5 halides and oxyhalides, namely DbCl, DbBr, DbOCl and DbOBr. Reports on these early experiments usually refer to dubnium as hahnium.</p>\n\n<h2>Nucleosynthesis history</h2>\n<h3>Cold fusion</h3>\n<p><i>This section deals with the synthesis of nuclei of dubnium by so-called \"cold\" fusion reactions. These are processes which create compound nuclei at low excitation energy (~10-20 MeV, hence \"cold\"), leading to a higher probability of survival from fission. The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of one or two neutrons only.</i></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Bi(Ti,xn)Db (x=1,2,3)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The first attempts to synthesise dubnium using cold fusion reactions were performed in 1976 by the team at FLNR, Dubna using the above reaction. They were able to detect a 5 s spontaneous fission (SF) activity which they assigned to Db. This assignment was later corrected to Db. In 1981, the team at GSI studied this reaction using the improved technique of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays. They were able to positively identify Db, the product from the 1n neutron evaporation channel. In 1983, the team at Dubna revisited the reaction using the method of identification of a descendant using chemical separation. They succeeded in measuring alpha decays from known descendants of the decay chain beginning with Db. This was taken as providing some evidence for the formation of dubnium nuclei. The team at GSI revisited the reaction in 1985 and were able to detect 10 atoms of Db. After a significant upgrade of their facilities in 1993, in 2000 the team measured 120 decays of Db, 16 decays of Db and decay of Db in the measurement of the 1n, 2n and 3n excitation functions. The data gathered for Db allowed a first spectroscopic study of this isotope and identified an isomer, Db, and a first determination of a decay level structure for Db. The reaction was used in spectroscopic studies of isotopes of mendelevium and einsteinium in 2003–2004.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Bi(Ti,xn)Db (x=2?)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was studied by Yuri Oganessian and the team at Dubna in 1983. They observed a 2.6 s SF activity tentatively assigned to Db. Later results suggest a possible reassignment to Rf, resulting from the ~30% EC branch in Db.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Bi(Ti,xn)Db (x=1?)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was studied by Yuri Oganessian and the team at Dubna in 1983. They observed a 1.6 s activity with a ~80% alpha branch with a ~20% SF branch. The activity was tentatively assigned to Db. Later results suggest a reassignment to Db.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Pb(V,xn)Db (x=1,2)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in 1976 and were again able to detect the 5 s SF activity, first tentatively assigned to Db and later to Db. In 2006, the team at LBNL reinvestigated this reaction as part of their odd-Z projectile program. They were able to detect Db and Db in their measurement of the 1n and 2n neutron evaporation channels.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Pb(V,xn)Db</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in 1976 but this time they were unable to detect the 5 s SF activity, first tentatively assigned to Db and later to Db. Instead, they were able to measure a 1.5 s SF activity, tentatively assigned to Db.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Tl(Cr,xn)Db (x=1?)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in 1976 and were again able to detect the 5 s SF activity, first tentatively assigned to Db and later to Db.</p>\n<h3>Hot fusion</h3>\n<p><i>This section deals with the synthesis of nuclei of dubnium by so-called \"hot\" fusion reactions. These are processes which create compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40-50 MeV, hence \"hot\"), leading to a reduced probability of survival from fission and quasi-fission. The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of 3-5 neutrons.</i></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Th(P,xn)Db (x=5)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>There are very limited reports that this rare reaction using a P-31 beam was studied in 1989 by Andreyev et al. at the FLNR. One source suggests that no atoms were detected whilst a better source from the Russians themselves indicates that Db was synthesised in the 5n channel with a yield of 120 pb.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>U(Al,xn)Db (x=4,5)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In 2006, as part of their study of the use of uranium targets in superheavy element synthesis, the LBNL team led by Ken Gregorich studied the excitation functions for the 4n and 5n channels in this new reaction.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>U(Al,xn)Db (x=5,6)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was first studied by Andreyev et al. at the FLNR, Dubna in 1992. They were able to observe Db and Db in the 5n and 6n exit channels with yields of 450 pb and 75 pb, respectively.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Am(Ne,xn)Db (x=5)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The first attempts to synthesise dubnium were performed in 1968 by the team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR) in Dubna, Russia. They observed two alpha lines which they tentatively assigned to Db and Db. They repeated their experiment in 1970 looking for spontaneous fission. They found a 2.2 s SF activity which they assigned to Db. In 1970, the Dubna team began work on using gradient thermochromatography in order to detect dubnium in chemical experiments as a volatile chloride. In their first run they detected a volatile SF activity with similar adsorption properties to NbCl and unlike HfCl. This was taken to indicate the formation of nuclei of dvi-niobium as DbCl. In 1971, they repeated the chemistry experiment using higher sensitivity and observed alpha decays from an dvi-niobium component, taken to confirm the formation of Db. The method was repeated in 1976 using the formation of bromides and obtained almost identical results, indicating the formation of a volatile, dvi-niobium-like DbBr.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Am(Ne,xn)Db (x=4,5)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In 2000, Chinese scientists at the Institute of Modern Physics (IMP), Lanzhou, announced the discovery of the previously unknown isotope Db formed in the 4n neutron evaporation channel. They were also able to confirm the decay properties for Db.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Cm(F,xn)Db (x=4,5)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was first studied in 1999 at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in order to produce Db for chemical studies. Just 4 atoms were detected with a cross section of 260 pb. Japanese scientists at JAERI studied the reaction further in 2002 and determined yields for the isotope Db during their efforts to study the aqueous chemistry of dubnium.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Bk(O,xn)Db (x=4,5)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Following from the discovery of Db by Albert Ghiorso in 1970 at the University of California (UC), the same team continued in 1971 with the discovery of the new isotope Db. They also observed an unassigned 25 s SF activity, probably associated with the now-known SF branch of Db. In 1990, a team led by Kratz at LBNL definitively discovered the new isotope Db in the 4n neutron evaporation channel. This reaction has been used by the same team on several occasions in order to attempt to confirm an electron capture (EC) branch in Db leading to long-lived Rf (see rutherfordium).</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Bk(O,xn)Db (x=4)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Following from the discovery of Db by Albert Ghiorso in 1970 at the University of California (UC), the same team continued in 1971 with the discovery of the new isotope Db.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Cf(N,xn)Db (x=4)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Following from the discovery of Db by Ghiorso in 1970 at LBNL, the same team continued in 1971 with the discovery of the new isotope Db.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Cf(N,xn)Db (x=4)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1970, the team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) studied this reaction and identified the isotope Db in their discovery experiment. They used the modern technique of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays to confirm their assignment. In 1977, the team at Oak Ridge repeated the experiment and were able to confirm the discovery by the identification of K X-rays from the daughter lawrencium.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Es(C,xn)Db</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1988, scientists as the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) used the asymmetric hot fusion reaction with an einsteinium-254 target to search for the new nuclides Db and Db. Due to the low sensitivity of the experiment caused by the small Es-254 target,they were unable to detect any evaporation residues (ER).</p>\n<h3>Decay of heavier nuclides</h3>\n<p>Isotopes of dubnium have also been identified in the decay of heavier elements. Observations to date are summarised in the table below:</p>\n\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of dubnium</div>\n\n<h3>Isomerism</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Db</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Recent data on the decay of Rg has revealed that some decay chains continue through Db with extraordinary longer life-times than expected. These decays have been linked to an isomeric level decaying by alpha decay with a half-life of ~19 s. Further research is required to allow a definite assignment.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Db</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Evidence for an isomeric state in Db has been gathered from the study of the decay of Mt and Bh. It has been noted that those decays assigned to an electron capture (EC) branch has a significantly different half-life to those decaying by alpha emission. This has been taken to suggest the existence of an isomeric state decaying by EC with a half-life of ~20 s. Further experiments are required to confirm this assignment.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Db</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>A study of the formation and decay of Db has proved the existence of an isomeric state. Initially, Db was taken to decay by alpha emission with energies 9.16,9.07 and 8.97 MeV. A measurement of the correlations of these decays with those of Lr have shown that the 9.16 MeV decay belongs to a separate isomer. Analysis of the data in conjunction with theory have assigned this activity to a meta stable state, Db. The ground state decays by alpha emission with energies 9.07 and 8.97 MeV. Spontaneous fission of Db was not confirmed in recent experiments.</p>\n<h3>Spectroscopic decay level schemes</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Db</dt>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThis is the currently suggested decay level scheme for Db from the study performed in 2001 by Hessberger et al. at GSI</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Retracted isotopes</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Db</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1983, scientists at Dubna carried out a series of supportive experiments in their quest for the discovery of Bohrium. In two such experiments, they claimed they had detected a ~1.5 s spontaneous fission activity from the reactions Pb(V,xn) and Bi(Ti,xn). The activity was assigned to Db. Later research suggested that the assignment should be changed to Db. As such, the isotope Db is currently not recognised on the chart of radionuclides and further research is required to confirm this isotope.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^        Haire, Richard G.

  "title": "Seaborgium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Seaborgium</b> is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol <b>Sg</b> and atomic number 106, whose most stable isotope Sg has a half-life of 1.9 minutes. A more recently discovered isotope Sg has a potentially slightly longer half-life (ca. 2.1 min) based on the observation of a single decay. Chemistry experiments with seaborgium have firmly placed it in group 6 as a heavier homologue to tungsten.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n<p>Scientists working at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, USSR reported their discovery of element 106 in June 1974. Synthesis was also reported in September 1974 at the Super HILAC accelerator at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory by a joint Lawrence Berkeley/Lawrence Livermore collaboration led by Albert Ghiorso and E. Kenneth Hulet. They produced the new nuclide Sg by bombarding a target of Cf with O ions. Cf + O→Sg This nuclide decays by α emission with a half-life of 0.9 ± 0.2 sec.</p>\n<h3>Naming</h3>\n<div>Main article: Element naming controversy</div>\n<p>The Berkeley/Livermore collaboration suggested the name <i>seaborgium</i> (Sg) to honor the American chemist Glenn T. Seaborg credited as a member of the American group in recognition of his participation in the discovery of several other actinides. The name selected by the team became controversial. The IUPAC adopted <i>unnilhexium</i> (symbol <i>Unh</i>) as a temporary, systematic element name. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 106 be named <i>rutherfordium</i> and adopted a rule that no element can be named after a living person. This ruling was fiercely objected to by the American Chemical Society. Critics pointed out that a precedent had been set in the naming of einsteinium during Albert Einstein's life and a survey indicated that chemists were not concerned with the fact that Seaborg was still alive. In 1997, as part of a compromise involving elements 104 to 108, the name <i>seaborgium</i> for element 106 was recognized internationally.</p>\n<h2>Chemical properties</h2>\n<h3>Extrapolated properties</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Oxidation states</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Seaborgium is projected to be the third member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group 6 in the Periodic Table, below chromium, molybdenum and tungsten. All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +6 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus seaborgium is expected to form a stable +6 state. For this group, stable +5 and +4 states are well represented for the heavier members and the +3 state is known but reducing, except for chromium(III).</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Chemistry</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Much seaborgium chemical behavior is predicted by extrapolation from its lighter congeners molybdenum and tungsten. Molybdenum and tungsten readily form stable trioxides MO, so seaborgium should form SgO. The oxides MO are soluble in alkali with the formation of oxyanions, so seaborgium should form a seaborgate ion, SgO. In addition, WO reacts with acid, suggesting similar amphotericity for SgO. Molybdenum oxide, MoO, also reacts with moisture to form a hydroxide MoO(OH), so SgO(OH) is also feasible. The heavier homologues readily form the volatile, reactive hexahalides MX (X=Cl,F). Only tungsten forms the unstable hexabromide, WBr. Therefore, the compounds SgF and SgCl are predicted, and \"eka-tungsten character\" may show itself in increased stability of the hexabromide, SgBr. These halides are unstable to oxygen and moisture and readily form volatile oxyhalides, MOX and MOX. Therefore SgOX (X=F,Cl) and SgOX (X=F,Cl) should be possible. In aqueous solution, a variety of anionic oxyfluoro-complexes are formed with fluoride ion, examples being MOF and MOF. Similar seaborgium complexes are expected.</p>\n<h3>Experimental chemistry</h3>\n<h4>Gas phase</h4>\n<p>Initial experiments aiming at probing the chemistry of seaborgium focused on the gas thermochromatography of a volatile oxychloride. Seaborgium atoms were produced in the reaction Cm(Ne,4n)Sg, thermalised, and reacted with an O/HCl mixture. The adsorption properties of the resulting oxychloride were measured and compared with those of molybdenum and tungsten compounds. The results indicated that seaborgium formed a volatile oxychloride akin to those of the other group 6 elements:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Sg + O\n2 + 2 HCl → SgO\n2Cl\n2 + H\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In 2001, a team continued the study of the gas phase chemistry of seaborgium by reacting the element with O in a HO environment. In a manner similar to the formation of the oxychloride, the results of the experiment indicated the formation of seaborgium oxide hydroxide, a reaction well known among the lighter group 6 homologues.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Sg + 3 O\n2 → 2 SgO\n3</dd>\n<dd>SgO\n3 + H\n2O → SgO\n2(OH)\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4>Aqueous phase</h4>\n<p>In its aqueous chemistry, seaborgium has been shown to resemble its lighter homologues molybdenum and tungsten, forming a stable +6 oxidation state. Seaborgium was eluted from cation exchange resin using a HNO/HF solution, most likely as neutral SgOF or the anionic complex ion [SgOF]. In contrast, in 0.1 M HNO, seaborgium does not elute, unlike Mo and W, indicating that the hydrolysis of [Sg(HO)] only proceeds as far as the cationic complex [Sg(OH)(HO)].</p>\n<h3>Summary of investigated compounds and complex ions</h3>\n\n<h2>Nucleosynthesis</h2>\n<h3>Cold fusion experiments</h3>\n<p><i>This section deals with the synthesis of nuclei of seaborgium by so-called \"cold\" fusion reactions. These are processes which create compound nuclei at low excitation energy (~10-20 MeV, hence \"cold\"), leading to a higher probability of survival from fission. The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of one or two neutrons only.</i></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Pb(Cr,xn)Sg (x=1,2,3)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The first attempt to synthesise seaborgium in cold fusion reactions was performed in September 1974 by a Soviet team led by G. N. Flerov at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna. They reported producing a 0.48 s spontaneous fission (SF) activity which they assigned to the isotope Sg. Based on later evidence it was suggested that the team most likely measured the decay of Sg and its daughter Rf. The TWG concluded that, at the time, the results were insufficiently convincing.</p>\n<p>The Dubna team revisited this problem in 1983–1984 and were able to detect a 5 ms SF activity assigned directly to Sg.</p>\n<p>The team at GSI studied this reaction for the first time in 1985 using the improved method of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays. They were able to detect Sg (x=1) and Sg and measured a partial 1n neutron evaporation excitation function. </p>\n<p>In December 2000, the reaction was studied by a team at GANIL, France and were able to detect 10 atoms of Sg and 2 atoms of Sg to add to previous data on the reaction.</p>\n<p>After a facility upgrade, the GSI team measured the 1n excitation function in 2003 using a metallic lead target. Of significance, in May 2003, the team successfully replaced the lead-208 target with more resistant lead(II) sulfide targets (PbS) which will allow more intense beams to be used in the future. They were able to measure the 1n,2n and 3n excitation functions and performed the first detailed alpha-gamma spectroscopy on the isotope Sg. They detected ~1600 atoms of the isotope and identified new alpha lines as well as measuring a more accurate half-life and new EC and SF branchings. Furthermore, they were able to detect the K X-rays from the daughter rutherfordium element for the first time. They were also able to provide improved data for Sg, including the tentative observation of an isomeric level. The study was continued in September 2005 and March 2006. The accumulated work on Sg was published in 2007. Work in September 2005 also aimed to begin spectroscopic studies on Sg.</p>\n<p>The team at the LBNL recently restudied this reaction in an effort to look at the spectroscopy of the isotope Sg. They were able to detect a new isomer, Sg, decaying by internal conversion into the ground state. In the same experiment, they were also able to confirm a K-isomer in the daughter Rf, namely Rf.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Pb(Cr,xn)Sg (x=1,2)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in 1974 with identical results as for their first experiments with a Pb-208 target. The SF activities were first assigned to Sg and later to Sg and/or Rf. Further work in 1983–1984 also detected a 5 ms SF activity assigned to the parent Sg.</p>\n<p>The GSI team studied this reaction for the first time in 1985 using the method of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays. They were able to positively identify Sg as a product from the 2n neutron evaporation channel.</p>\n<p>The reaction was further used in March 2005 using PbS targets to begin a spectroscopic study of the even-even isotope Sg.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Pb(Cr,xn)Sg</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was studied in 1974 by the team at Dubna. It was used to assist them in their assignment of the observed SF activities in reactions using Pb-207 and Pb-208 targets. They were unable to detect any SF, indicating the formation of isotopes decaying primarily by alpha decay.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Pb(Cr,xn)Sg (x=1,2)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in their series of cold fusion reactions performed in 1974. Once again they were unable to detect any SF activities. The reaction was revisited in 2006 by the team at LBNL as part of their studies on the effect of the isospin of the projectile and hence the mass number of the compound nucleus on the yield of evaporation residues. They were able to identify Sg and Sg in their measurement of the 1n excitation function.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Bi(V,xn)Sg (x=2)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in their series of cold fusion reactions performed in 1974. Once again they were unable to detect any SF activities. In 1994, the synthesis of seaborgium was revisited using this reaction by the GSI team, in order to study the new even-even isotope Sg. Ten atoms of Sg were detected and decayed by spontaneous fission.</p>\n<h3>Hot fusion experiments</h3>\n<p><i>This section deals with the synthesis of nuclei of seaborgium by so-called \"hot\" fusion reactions. These are processes which create compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40-50 MeV, hence \"hot\"), leading to a reduced probability of survival from fission and quasi-fission. The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of 3-5 neutrons.</i></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>U(Si,xn)Sg (x=3,4,5,6)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This reaction was first studied by Japanese scientists at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) in 1998. They detected a spontaneous fission activity which they tentatively assigned to the new isotope Sg or Db, formed by EC of Sg. In 2006, the teams at GSI and LBNL both studied this reaction using the method of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays. The LBNL team measured an excitation function for the 4n,5n and 6n channels, whilst the GSI team were able to observe an additional 3n activity. Both teams were able to identify the new isotope Sg which decayed with a short lifetime by spontaneous fission.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Cm(Ne,xn)Sg (x=4?,5)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In 1993, at Dubna, Yuri Lazarev and his team announced the discovery of long-lived Sg and Sg produced in the 4n and 5n channels of this nuclear reaction following the search for seaborgium isotopes suitable for a first chemical study. It was announced that Sg decayed by 8.57 MeV alpha-particle emission with a projected half-life of ~20 s, lending strong support to the stabilising effect of the Z=108,N=162 closed shells. This reaction was studied further in 1997 by a team at GSI and the yield, decay mode and half-lives for Sg and Sg have been confirmed, although there are still some discrepancies. In the recent synthesis of Hs (see hassium), Sg was found to undergo exclusively SF with a short half-life (T = 360 ms). It is possible that this is the ground state, (Sg) and that the other activity, produced directly, belongs to a high spin K-isomer, Sg, but further results are required to confirm this.</p>\n<p>A recent re-evaluation of the decay characteristics of Sg and Sg has suggested that all decays to date in this reaction were in fact from Sg, which exists in two isomeric forms. The first, Sg has a principal alpha-line at 8.85 MeV and a calculated half-life of 8.9 s, whilst Sg has a decay energy of 8.70 MeV and a half-life of 16.2 s. Both isomeric levels are populated when produced directly. Data from the decay of Hs indicates that Sg is produced during the decay of Hs and that Sg decays into the shorter-lived Rf isotope. This means that the observation of Sg as a long-lived alpha emitter is retracted and that it does indeed undergo fission in a short time.</p>\n<p>Regardless of these assignments, the reaction has been successfully used in the recent attempts to study the chemistry of seaborgium (see below).</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Cf(O,xn)Sg (x=4)</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The synthesis of seaborgium was first realized in 1974 by the LBNL/LLNL team. In their discovery experiment, they were able to apply the new method of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays to identify the new isotope Sg. In 1975, the team at Oak Ridge were able to confirm the decay data but were unable to identify coincident X-rays in order to prove that seaborgium was produced. In 1979, the team at Dubna studied the reaction by detection of SF activities. In comparison with data from Berkeley, they calculated a 70% SF branching for Sg. The original synthesis and discovery reaction was confirmed in 1994 by a different team at LBNL.</p>\n<h3>As decay product</h3>\n<p>Isotopes of seaborgium have also been observed in the decay of heavier elements. Observations to date are summarised in the table below:</p>\n\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of seaborgium</div>\n\n<p>There are 12 known isotopes of seaborgium (excluding meta-stable and K-spin isomers). The longest-lived is currently Sg which decays through alpha decay and spontaneous fission, with a half-life of around 2.1 minutes. The shortest-lived isotope is Sg which also decays through alpha decay and spontaneous fission. It has a half-life of 2.9 ms.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear isomerism</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Sg</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Initial work identified an 8.63 MeV alpha-decaying activity with a half-life of ~21s and assigned to the ground state of Sg. Later work identified a nuclide decaying by 8.52 and 8.77 MeV alpha emission with a half-life of ~21s, which is unusual for an even-even nuclide. Recent work on the synthesis of Hs identified Sg decaying by SF with a short 360 ms half-life. The recent work on Cn and Hs has provided new information on the decay of Sg and Rf. This work suggested that the initial 8.77 MeV activity should be reassigned to Sg. Therefore the current information suggests that the SF activity is the ground state and the 8.52 MeV activity is a high spin K-isomer. Further work is required to confirm these assignments. A recent re-evaluation of the data has suggested that the 8.52 MeV activity should be associated with Sg and that Sg only undergoes fission.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Sg</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The recent direct synthesis of Sg resulted in four alpha-lines at 8.94,8.84,8.76 and 8.69 MeV with a half-life of 7.4 seconds. The observation of the decay of Sg from the decay of Cn and Hs indicated that the 8.69 MeV line may be associated with an isomeric level with an associated half-life of ~ 20 s. It is plausible that this level is causing confusion between assignments of Sg and Sg since both can decay to fissioning rutherfordium isotopes.</p>\n<p>A recent re-evaluation of the data has indicated that there are indeed two isomers, one with a principal decay energy of 8.85 MeV with a half-life of 8.9 s, and a second isomer which decays with energy 8.70 MeV with a half-life of 16.2 s.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Sg</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The discovery synthesis of Sg resulted in an alpha-line at 9.06 MeV. Observation of this nuclide by decay of Ds, Ds and Hs has confirmed an isomer decaying by 9.25 MeV alpha emission. The 9.06 MeV decay was also confirmed. The 9.06 MeV activity has been assigned to the ground state isomer with an associated half-life of 0.3 s. The 9.25 MeV activity has been assigned to an isomeric level decaying with a half-life of 0.9 s.</p>\n<p>Recent work on the synthesis of Ds was resulted in some confusing data regarding the decay of Hs. In one such decay, Hs decayed to Sg which decayed by alpha emission with a half-life of ~ 6 s. This activity has not yet been positively assigned to an isomer and further research is required.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Spectroscopic decay schemes for Sg</dt>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThis is the currently accepted decay scheme for Sg from the study by Streicher et al. at GSI in 2003–2006</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Retracted isotopes</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Sg</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In the claimed synthesis of Uuo in 1999 the isotope Sg was identified as a daughter product. It decayed by 8.74 MeV alpha emission with a half-life of 22 s. The claim was retracted in 2001. This isotope was finally created in 2010.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^       Haire, Richard G. (2006). \"Transactinides and the future elements\".

  "title": "Bohrium",
  "html": "<div>Not to be confused with Borium, Boron, or Barium.</div>\n\n<p><b>Bohrium</b> is a chemical element with symbol <b>Bh</b> and atomic number 107, named in honor of Danish physicist Niels Bohr. It is a synthetic element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, Bh, has a half-life of approximately 61&nbsp;seconds.</p>\n<p>In the periodic table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 7 elements. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier homologue to rhenium in group 7. The chemical properties of bohrium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nThe element 107 was originally proposed to be named after Niels Bohr (left side), a Danish nuclear physicist, with the name <i>nielsbohrium</i> (Ns). This name was later changed by IUPAC to <i>bohrium</i> (Bh).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Official discovery</h3>\n<p>Bohrium was first convincingly synthesized in 1981 by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt. The team bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 to produce 5 atoms of the isotope bohrium-262:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>209\n83Bi + 54\n24Cr → 262\n107Bh + n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report.</p>\n<h3>Proposed names</h3>\n<p>The German group suggested the name <i>nielsbohrium</i> with symbol <i>Ns</i> to honor the Danish physicist Niels Bohr. The Soviet scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia had suggested this name be given to element 105 (which was finally called dubnium) and the German team wished to recognise both Bohr and the fact that the Dubna team had been the first to propose the cold fusion reaction to solve the controversial problem of the naming of element 105. The Dubna team agreed with the German group's naming proposal for element 107.</p>\n<p>There was an element naming controversy as to what the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the IUPAC adopted <i>unnilseptium</i> (symbol <i>Uns</i>) as a temporary, systematic element name for this element. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named <i>bohrium</i>, not <i>nielsbohrium</i>, since there was no precedence for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element. This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with boron and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective oxyanions, <i>bohrate</i> and <i>borate</i>. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name <i>bohrium</i>, and thus the name <i>bohrium</i> for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997. The IUPAC subsequently decided that bohrium salts should be called <i>bohriates</i> instead of <i>bohrates</i>.</p>\n<h2>Nucleosynthesis</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of bohrium</div>\n<p>Super-heavy elements such as bohrium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induce fusion reactions. Whereas most of the isotopes of bohrium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers.</p>\n<p>Depending on the energies involved, the former are separated into \"hot\" and \"cold\". In hot fusion reactions, very light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets (actinides), giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40–50 MeV) that may either fission or evaporate several (3 to 5) neutrons. In cold fusion reactions, the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy (~10–20 MeV), which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the ground state, they require emission of only one or two neutrons, and thus, allows for the generation of more neutron-rich products. The latter is a distinct concept from that of where nuclear fusion claimed to be achieved at room temperature conditions (see cold fusion).</p>\n<h3>Cold fusion</h3>\n<p>Before the first successful synthesis of hassium in 1981 by the GSI team, the synthesis of bohrium was first attempted in 1976 by scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna using this cold fusion reaction. They detected two spontaneous fission activities, one with a half-life of 1-2&nbsp;ms and one with a half-life of 5&nbsp;s. Based on the results of other cold fusion reactions, they concluded that they were due to Bh and Db respectively. However, later evidence gave a much lower SF branching for Bh reducing confidence in this assignment. The assignment of the dubnium activity was later changed to Db, presuming that the decay of bohrium was missed. The 2 ms SF activity was assigned to Rf resulting from the 33% EC branch. The GSI team studied the reaction in 1981 in their discovery experiments. Five atoms of Bh were detected using the method of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays. In 1987, an internal report from Dubna indicated that the team had been able to detect the spontaneous fission of Bh directly. The GSI team further studied the reaction in 1989 and discovered the new isotope Bh during the measurement of the 1n and 2n excitation functions but were unable to detect an SF branching for Bh. They continued their study in 2003 using newly developed bismuth(III) fluoride (BiF) targets, used to provide further data on the decay data for Bh and the daughter Db. The 1n excitation function was remeasured in 2005 by the team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) after some doubt about the accuracy of previous data. They observed 18 atoms of Bh and 3 atoms of Bh and confirmed the two isomers of Bh.</p>\n<p>In 2007, the team at LBNL studied the analogous reaction with chromium-52 projectiles for the first time to search for the lightest bohrium isotope Bh:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>209\n83Bi + 52\n24Cr → 260\n107Bh + n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The team successfully detected 8 atoms of Bh decaying by alpha decay to Db, emitting alpha particles with energy 10.16&nbsp;MeV. The alpha decay energy indicates the continued stabilizing effect of the N=152 closed shell.</p>\n<p>The team at Dubna also studied the reaction between lead-208 targets and manganese-55 projectiles in 1976 as part of their newly established cold fusion approach to new elements:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>208\n82Pb + 55\n25Mn → 262\n107Bh + n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>They observed the same spontaneous fission activities as those observed in the reaction between bismuth-209 and chromium-54 and again assigned them to Bh and Db. Later evidence indicated that these should be reassigned to Db and Rf (see above). In 1983, they repeated the experiment using a new technique: measurement of alpha decay from a decay product that had been separated out chemically. The team were able to detect the alpha decay from a decay product of Bh, providing some evidence for the formation of bohrium nuclei. This reaction was later studied in detail using modern techniques by the team at LBNL. In 2005 they measured 33 decays of Bh and 2 atoms of Bh, providing an excitation function for the reaction emitting one neutron and some spectroscopic data of both Bh isomers. The excitation function for the reaction emitting two neutrons was further studied in a 2006 repeat of the reaction. The team found that the reaction emitting one neutron had a higher cross section than the corresponding reaction with a Bi target, contrary to expectations. Further research is required to understand the reasons.</p>\n<h3>Hot fusion</h3>\n<p>The reaction between uranium-238 targets and phosphorus-31 projectiles was first studied in 2006 at the LBNL as part of their systematic study of fusion reactions using uranium-238 targets:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>238\n92U + 31\n15P → 264\n107Bh + 5 n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Results have not been published but preliminary results appear to indicate the observation of spontaneous fission, possibly from Bh.</p>\n<p>Recently, the team at the Institute of Modern Physics (IMP), Lanzhou, have studied the nuclear reaction between americium-243 targets and accelerated nuclei of magnesium-26 in order to synthesise the new isotope Bh and gather more data on Bh:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>243\n95Am + 26\n12Mg → 269−x\n107Bh + x n (x = 3, 4, or 5)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In two series of experiments, the team measured partial excitation functions for the reactions emitting three, four, and five neutrons.</p>\n<p>The reaction between targets of curium-248 and accelerated nuclei of sodium-23 was studied for the first time in 2008 by the team at RIKEN, Japan, in order to study the decay properties of Bh, which is a decay product in their claimed decay chains of ununtrium:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>248\n96Cm + 23\n11Na → 271−x\n107Bh + x n (x = 4 or 5)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The decay of Bh by the emission of alpha particles with energies of 9.05-9.23&nbsp;MeV was further confirmed in 2010.</p>\n<p>The first attempts to synthesize bohrium by hot fusion pathways were performed in 1979 by the team at Dubna, using the reaction between accelerated nuclei of neon-22 and targets of berkelium-249:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>249\n97Bk + 22\n10Ne → 271−x\n107Bh + x n (x = 4 or 5)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The reaction was repeated in 1983. In both cases, they were unable to detect any spontaneous fission from nuclei of bohrium. More recently, hot fusions pathways to bohrium have been re-investigated in order to allow for the synthesis of more long-lived, neutron rich isotopes to allow a first chemical study of bohrium. In 1999, the team at LBNL claimed the discovery of long-lived Bh (5 atoms) and Bh (1 atom). Later, both of these were confirmed. The team at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Bern, Switzerland later synthesized 6 atoms of Bh in the first definitive study of the chemistry of bohrium.</p>\n<h3>As decay products</h3>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Bohrium has been detected in the decay chains of elements with a higher atomic number, such as meitnerium. Meitnerium currently has seven known isotopes; all of them undergo alpha decays to become bohrium nuclei, with mass numbers between 262 and 274. Parent meitnerium nuclei can be themselves decay products of roentgenium, ununtrium, ununpentium, or ununseptium. To date, no other elements have been known to decay to bohrium. For example, in January 2010, the Dubna team (JINR) identified bohrium-274 as a product in the decay of ununseptium via an alpha decay sequence:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>294\n117Uus → 290\n115Uup + 4\n2He</dd>\n<dd>290\n115Uup → 286\n113Uut + 4\n2He</dd>\n<dd>286\n113Uut → 282\n111Rg + 4\n2He</dd>\n<dd>282\n111Rg → 278\n109Mt + 4\n2He</dd>\n<dd>278\n109Mt → 274\n107Bh + 4\n2He</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of bohrium</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Bohrium has no stable or naturally-occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Eleven different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known metastable state. All of these decay only through alpha decay, although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission.</p>\n<h3>Stability and half-lives</h3>\n<p>The lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100&nbsp;ms for Bh, Bh, Bh, Bh, and Bh were observed. Bh, Bh, Bh, and Bh are more stable at around 1&nbsp;s, and Bh and Bh have half-lives of about 10&nbsp;s. The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with Bh and Bh having measured half-lives of about 61&nbsp;s and 54&nbsp;s respectively. The unknown isotopes Bh and Bh are predicted to have even longer half-lives of around 90&nbsp;minutes and 40&nbsp;minutes respectively. Before its discovery, Bh was also predicted to have a long half-life of 90&nbsp;minutes, but it was found to have a shorter half-life of only about 54&nbsp;seconds.</p>\n<p>The proton-rich isotopes with masses 260, 261, and 262 were directly produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 were reported in the decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium, while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets. The four most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, and 274 appear in the decay chains of 113, 115, 115, and 117 respectively. These eleven isotopes have half-lives ranging from 8&nbsp;miliseconds to 1&nbsp;minute.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear isomerism</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Bh</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The only confirmed example of isomerism in bohrium is in the isotope Bh. Direct synthesis of Bh results in two states, a ground state and an isomeric state. The ground state is confirmed to decay by alpha decay, emitting alpha particles with energies of 10.08, 9.82, and 9.76&nbsp;MeV, and has a revised half-life of 84&nbsp;ms. The excited state also decays by alpha decay, emitting alpha particles with energies of 10.37 and 10.24&nbsp;MeV, and has a revised half-life of 9.6 ms.</p>\n<h2>Chemical properties</h2>\n<h3>Extrapolated</h3>\n<p>Bohrium is projected to be the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group VII in the Periodic Table, below manganese, technetium and rhenium. All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well.</p>\n<p>The heavier members of the group are known to form volatile heptoxides MO, so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide BhO. The oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid, HBhO. Rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MOCl, so BhOCl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MOF and MOF for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds ReOF and ReF. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties.</p>\n<h3>Experimental</h3>\n<p>In 1995, the first report on attempted isolation of the element was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>In 2000, it was confirmed that although relativistic effects are important, the 107th element does behave like a typical group 7 element.</p>\n<p>In 2000, a team at the PSI conducted a chemistry reaction using atoms of Bh produced in the reaction between Bk-249 and Ne-22 ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, technetium (as Tc) and rhenium (as Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>2 Bh + 3 O\n2 + 2 HCl → 2 BhO\n3Cl + H\n2</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Johnson, E.; Fricke, B.; Jacob, T.; Dong, C.

  "title": "Hassium",
  "html": "\n<p><b>Hassium</b> is a chemical element with symbol <b>Hs</b> and atomic number 108, named in honor of the German state of Hesse. It is a synthetic element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, Hs, has a half-life of approximately 9.7&nbsp;seconds, although an unconfirmed metastable state, Hs, may have a longer half-life of about 11&nbsp;minutes. More than 100&nbsp;atoms of hassium have been synthesized to date.</p>\n<p>In the periodic table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 8 elements. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier homologue to osmium in group 8. The chemical properties of hassium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements. In bulk quantities, hassium is expected to be a silvery metal that reacts readily with oxygen in the air, forming a volatile tetroxide.</p>\n<div></div>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>See also: Discovery of the chemical elements</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nLocation of Hesse within Germany</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The synthesis of element 108 was first attempted in 1978 by a Russian research team led by Yuri Oganessian and Vladimir Utyonkov at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, using reactions that would generate the isotopes hassium-270 and hassium-264. The data was uncertain and they carried out new experiments on hassium five years later, where these two isotopes as well as hassium-263 were produced; the hassium-264 experiment was repeated again and confirmed in 1984.</p>\n<p>Hassium was officially discovered in 1984 by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt. The team bombarded a target of lead-208 with accelerated nuclei of iron-58 to produce 3&nbsp;atoms of the isotope hassium-265.</p>\n<p>Due to this issue, a controversy arose over who should be recognized as the official discoverer of The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report. They stated that the GSI collaboration was \"more detailed and, of itself, carries conviction\", and that while the combined data from Dubna and Darmstadt confirmed that hassium had been synthesized, the major credit was awarded to the GSI. This statement came in spite of the combined data also supporting the Russian 1983 discovery claim and the TWG also acknowledging that \"very probably element 108 played a role in the Dubna experiment.\"</p>\n<p>The name <i>hassium</i> was proposed by Peter Armbruster and his colleagues, the officially recognised German discoverers, in 1992, derived from the Latin name (<i>Hassia</i>) for the German state of Hesse where the institute is located. Using Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, hassium should be known as <i>eka-osmium</i> or <i>dvi-ruthenium</i>. In 1979, during the Transfermium Wars (but before the synthesis of hassium), IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called <i>unniloctium</i> (with the corresponding symbol of <i>Uno</i>), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. The recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists, who either called it \"element 108\", with the symbol of <i>(108)</i> or even simply <i>108</i>, or used the proposed name \"hassium\".</p>\n<p>In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named <i>hahnium</i> (Hn) after the German physicist Otto Hahn, after an older suggestion of <i>ottohahnium</i> (Oh) in spite of the long-standing convention to give the discoverer the right to suggest a name, so that elements named after Hahn and Lise Meitner (meitnerium) would be next to each other, honoring their joint discovery of nuclear fission. This was because they felt that Hesse did not merit an element being named after it. After protests from the German discoverers and the American Chemical Society, IUPAC relented and the name <i>hassium</i> (Hs) was adopted internationally in 1997.</p>\n<h2>Natural occurrence</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMolybdenite</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hassium is not known to occur naturally on Earth because the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that essentially none of any primordial hassium would have survived to the present day. However, this does not rule out the possibility of as yet unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some of which could, if long-lived enough, still exist in trace quantities today. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed nuclear isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not have been caused by any known natural radioisotopes, but could have been caused by superheavy elements. In 1963, Soviet scientist Victor Cherdyntsev claimed to have discovered element 108 (specifically, the Hs isotope) in natural molybdenite and suggested the name <i>sergenium</i> (symbol Sg; at the time, this symbol had not yet been taken by seaborgium) for it, after the ancient city of Serik along the Silk Road in Kazakhstan where his molybdenite samples came from.</p>\n<p>In 2006, it was hypothesized that an isomer of Hs might have a half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×10&nbsp;y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4&nbsp;MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiride. This isomer of Hs could be produced from the beta decay of Bh and Sg, which, being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since hassium is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiride if it occurred in nature. However, the decay chains of these isotopes are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with Hs are predicted to also have to have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.</p>\n<p>In 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research conducted a search for natural hassium. This was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays, but no results have been released, strongly implying that no natural hassium was found. The possible extent of primordial hassium on Earth is uncertain; it might now only exist in traces, or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the radiation damage long ago.</p>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of hassium</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Hassium has no stable or naturally-occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 263 to 277 (with the exceptions of 272, 274, and 276), four of which, hassium-265, hassium-267, hassium-269, and hassium-277, have known metastable states (although that of hassium-277 is unconfirmed). Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some also undergo spontaneous fission.</p>\n<p>The lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 1&nbsp;ms for Hs, Hs, and Hs were observed. Hs and Hs are more stable at around 2&nbsp;ms, Hs has a half-life of about 50&nbsp;ms, Hs, Hs, Hs, and Hs live between 0.1 and 1&nbsp;second, and Hs, Hs, Hs, Hs, and Hs are more stable, at between 1 and 30&nbsp;seconds. The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with Hs having a measured half-life of about 11&nbsp;minutes. The unknown isotopes Hs, Hs, and Hs are predicted to have even longer half-lives of around 40&nbsp;seconds, 1&nbsp;minute and 1&nbsp;hour respectively. Before its discovery, Hs was also predicted to have a long half-life of 40&nbsp;seconds, but it was found to have a shorter half-life of only about 4&nbsp;seconds.</p>\n<p>The lightest isotopes were synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is Hs; heavier isotopes have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers. In 1999, American scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 118. These parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted three alpha particles to form hassium-273 nuclei, which were claimed to have undergone an alpha decay, emitting alpha particles with decay energies of 9.78 and 9.47&nbsp;MeV and half-life 1.2&nbsp;s, but their claim was retracted in 2001. The isotope, however, was produced in 2010 by the same team. The new data matched the previous (fabricated) data.</p>\n<h3>Hs: prospects for a deformed doubly magic nucleus</h3>\n<p>According to calculations, 108 is a proton magic number for deformed nuclei (nuclei that are far from spherical), and 162 is a neutron magic number for deformed nuclei. This means that such nuclei are permanently deformed in their ground state but have high, narrow fission barriers to further deformation and hence relatively long life-times to spontaneous fission. The spontaneous fission half-lives in this region are typically reduced by a factor of 10 in comparison with those in the vicinity of the spherical doubly magic nucleus Fl, caused by the narrower fission barrier for such deformed nuclei. Hence, the nucleus Hs has promise as a deformed doubly magic nucleus. Experimental data from the decay of the darmstadtium (Z=110) isotopes Ds and Ds provides strong evidence for the magic nature of the N=162 sub-shell. The recent synthesis of Hs, Hs, and Hs also fully support the assignment of N=162 as a magic number. In particular, the low decay energy for Hs is in complete agreement with calculations.</p>\n<p>Evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 proton shell can be obtained from two sources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the variation in the partial spontaneous fission half-lives for isotones</li>\n<li>the large gap in the alpha Q value for isotonic nuclei of hassium and darmstadtium.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For spontaneous fission, it is necessary to measure the half-lives for the isotonic nuclei Sg, Hs and Ds. Since the isotopes Sg and Ds are not currently known, and fission of Hs has not been measured, this method cannot be used to date to confirm the stabilizing nature of the Z=108 shell. However, good evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 shell can be deemed from the large differences in the alpha decay energies measured for Hs, Ds and Ds. More conclusive evidence would come from the determination of the decay energy for the unknown nucleus Ds.</p>\n<h2>Predicted properties</h2>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nBall-and-stick model of the osmium tetroxide molecule. Hassium tetroxide should have a similar structure.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Hassium is the sixth member of the 6d series of transition metals and is expected to be in the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials, atomic radius, as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of osmium. Therefore it was concluded that hassium's basic properties will resemble those of other group 8 elements, below iron, ruthenium, and osmium. Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase chemistry experiments. The group 8 elements portray a wide variety of oxidation states, but the latter two members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +8 and this state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Ruthenium and osmium show the highest oxidation states of all the elements in their respective periods and are the only non-superheavy elements to show the +8 state, except for xenon, iridium, and plutonium (unstable). Thus hassium is expected to form a stable +8 state. Osmium also shows stable +5, +4, and +3 states with the +4 state the most stable. For ruthenium, the +6, +5, +4, and +3 states are stable with the +3 state being the most stable. Hassium is therefore expected to also show other stable lower oxidation states, such as +6, +5, +4, +3, and +2.</p>\n<p>The group 8 elements show a very distinctive oxide chemistry which allows extrapolations to be made easily for hassium. All the lighter members have known or hypothetical tetroxides, MO. The oxidising power decreases as one descends the group such that FeO is not known due to an extraordinary electron affinity which results in the formation of the well-known oxoanion ferrate(VI), FeO2−\n4. Ruthenium tetroxide, RuO, formed by oxidation of ruthenium(VI) in acid, readily undergoes reduction to ruthenate(VI), RuO2−\n4. Oxidation of ruthenium metal in air forms the dioxide, RuO. In contrast, osmium burns to form the stable tetroxide, OsO, which complexes with the hydroxide ion to form an osmium(VIII) -<i>ate</i> complex, [OsO(OH)]. Therefore, eka-osmium properties for hassium should be demonstrated by the formation of a stable, very volatile tetroxide HsO (due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule), which undergoes complexation with hydroxide to form a hassate(VIII), [HsO(OH)]. The trend of the volatilities of the group 8 tetroxides is expected to be RuO&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;OsO&nbsp;≤&nbsp;HsO, based on the calculated enthalpies of adsorption for the three compounds; this trend remains the same whether or not relativistic effects are taken into account.</p>\n<h3>Physical and atomic</h3>\n<p>Hassium is predicted to have a bulk density of 41&nbsp;g/cm, the highest of any of the 118 known elements and nearly twice the density of osmium, the most dense measured element, at 22.61&nbsp;g/cm. This results from hassium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough hassium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius of hassium is expected to be around 126&nbsp;pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Hs ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of [Rn] 5f 6d 7s, giving up a 6d electron instead of a 7s electron, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues. On the other hand, the Hs ion is expected to have an electron configuration of [Rn] 5f 6d 7s, analogous to that calculated for the Os ion.</p>\n<h2>Experimental atomic gas phase chemistry</h2>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Despite the fact that the selection of a volatile hassium compound (hassium tetroxide) for gas-phase chemical studies was clear from the beginning, the chemical characterization of hassium was considered a difficult task for a long time. Although hassium isotopes were first synthesized in 1984, it was not until 1996 that a hassium isotope long-lived enough to allow chemical studies to be performed was synthesized. Unfortunately, this hassium isotope, Hs, was then synthesized indirectly from the decay of Cn; not only are indirect synthesis methods not favourable for chemical studies, but also the reaction that produced the isotope Cn had a low yield (its cross-section was only 1&nbsp;pb), and thus did not provide enough hassium atoms for a chemical investigation. The direct synthesis of Hs and Hs in the reaction Cm(Mg,xn)Hs (x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 or 5) appeared more promising, as the cross-section for this reaction was somewhat larger, at 7&nbsp;pm. However, this yield was still around an order of magnitude lower than that for the reaction used for the chemical characterization of bohrium. New techniques for irradiation, separation, and detection had to be introduced before hassium could be successfully characterized chemically as a typical member of group 8 in early 2001.</p>\n<p>Ruthenium and osmium have very similar chemistry due to the lanthanide contraction, but iron shows some differences from them: for example, although ruthenium and osmium form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the +8 oxidation state, iron does not. Consequently, in preparation for the chemical characterization of hassium, researches focused on ruthenium and osmium rather than iron, as hassium was expected to also be similar to ruthenium and osmium due to the actinide contraction. However, in the planned experiment to study hassocene (Hs(CH)), ferrocene may also be used for comparison along with ruthenocene and osmocene.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nSchematic diagram of the IVO-COLD system, which was used to study the gas-phase properties of hassium tetroxide (HsO) and its lighter homologues ruthenium tetroxide (RuO) and osmium tetroxide (OsO).</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>In ferrocene, the cyclopentadienyl rings are in a staggered conformation.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>In ruthenocene and osmocene, the cyclopentadienyl rings are in an eclipsed conformation. Hassocene is predicted to also have this structure.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The first chemistry experiments were performed using gas thermochromatography in 2001, using Os and Os as a reference. During the experiment, 5 hassium atoms were synthesized using the reaction Cm(Mg,5n)Hs. They were then thermalized and oxidized in a mixture of helium and oxygen gas to form the tetroxide.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>269Hs + 2 O\n2 → 269HsO\n4</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The measured deposition temperature indicated that hassium(VIII) oxide is less volatile than osmium tetroxide, OsO, and places hassium firmly in group 8. However, the enthalpy of adsorption for HsO measured, (−46 ± 2) kJ/mol, was significantly lower than what was predicted, (−36.7 ± 1.5) kJ/mol, indicating that OsO was more volatile than HsO, contradicting earlier calculations, which implied that they should have very similar volatilities. For comparison, the value for OsO is (−39 ± 1) kJ/mol. It is possible that hassium tetroxide interacts differently with the different chemicals (silicon nitride and silicon dioxide) used for the detector; further research is required, including more accurate measurements of the nuclear properties of Hs and comparisons with RuO in addition to OsO.</p>\n<p>In order to further probe the chemistry of hassium, scientists decided to assess the reaction between hassium tetroxide and sodium hydroxide to form sodium hassate(VIII), a reaction well-known with osmium. In 2004, scientists announced that they had succeeded in carrying out the first acid-base reaction with a hassium compound:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>HsO\n4 + 2 NaOH → Na\n2[HsO\n4(OH)\n2]</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The team from the University of Mainz are planning to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. The current aim is to use the reaction Ra(Ca,4n)Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI are hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(CH), using the reaction Ra(Ca,xn). This compound is analogous to the lighter ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene. Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which has been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^              Emsley, John (2011).

  "title": "Meitnerium",
  "html": "<div></div>\n\n<p><b>Meitnerium</b> is a chemical element with symbol <b>Mt</b> and atomic number 109. It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element (an element not found in nature that can be created in a laboratory). The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 7.6&nbsp;seconds. The GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany, first created this element in 1982.</p>\n<p>In the periodic table, is a d-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 9 elements, although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to iridium in group 9. Meitnerium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\nMeitnerium was named after the physicist Lise Meitner, one of the discoverers of nuclear fission.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n<p>Meitnerium was first synthesized on August 29, 1982 by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt. The team bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of iron-58 and detected a single atom of the isotope meitnerium-266:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>209\n83Bi + 58\n26Fe → 266\n109Mt + n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Naming</h3>\n<p>The naming of meitnerium was discussed in the element naming controversy regarding the names of elements 104 to 109, but <i>meitnerium</i> was the only proposal and thus was never disputed. The name <i>meitnerium</i> (Mt) was suggested in honor of the Austrian physicist Lise Meitner, a co-discoverer of protactinium (with Otto Hahn), and one of the discoverers of nuclear fission. In 1994 the name was recommended by IUPAC, and was officially adopted in 1997.</p>\n<h2>Nucleosynthesis</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of meitnerium</div>\n<p>Super-heavy elements such as meitnerium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induce fusion reactions. Whereas the lightest isotope of meitnerium, meitnerium-266, can be synthesized directly this way, all the heavier meitnerium isotopes have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers.</p>\n<p>Depending on the energies involved, the former are separated into \"hot\" and \"cold\". In hot fusion reactions, very light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets (actinides), giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40–50 MeV) that may either fission or evaporate several (3 to 5) neutrons. In cold fusion reactions, the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy (~10–20 MeV), which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the ground state, they require emission of only one or two neutrons, and thus, allows for the generation of more neutron-rich products. The latter is a distinct concept from that of where nuclear fusion claimed to be achieved at room temperature conditions (see cold fusion).</p>\n<h3>Cold fusion</h3>\n<p>After the first successful synthesis of meitnerium in 1982 by the GSI team, a team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, also tried to observe the new element by bombarding bismuth-209 with iron-58. In 1985 they managed to identity alpha decays from the descendant isotope Cf indicating the formation of meitnerium. The observation of a further two atoms of Mt from the same reaction was reported in 1988 and of another 12 in 1997 by the German team at GSI.</p>\n<p>The same meitnerium isotope was also observed by the Russian team at Dubna in 1985 from the reaction:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>208\n82Pb + 59\n27Co → 266\n109Mt + n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>by detecting the alpha decay of the descendant Cf nuclei. In 2007, an American team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) confirmed the decay chain of the Mt isotope from this reaction.</p>\n<h3>Hot fusion</h3>\n<p>In 2002–2003, the team at the LBNL attempted to generate the isotope Mt to study its chemical properties by bombarding uranium-238 with chlorine-37, but without success. Another possible reaction that would form this isotope would be the fusion of berkelium-249 with magnesium-26; however, the yield for this reaction is expected to be very low due to the high radioactivity of the berkelium-249 target. Other long-lived isotopes were unsuccessfully targeted by a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1988 by bombarding einsteinium-254 with neon-22.</p>\n<h3>Decay products</h3>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>All the isotopes of meitnerium except meitnerium-266 have been detected only in the decay chains of elements with a higher atomic number, such as roentgenium. Roentgenium currently has seven known isotopes; all but one of them undergo alpha decays to become meitnerium nuclei, with mass numbers between 268 and 278. Parent roentgenium nuclei can be themselves decay products of ununtrium, ununpentium, or ununseptium. To date, no other elements have been known to decay to meitnerium. For example, in January 2010, the Dubna team (JINR) identified meitnerium-278 as a product in the decay of ununseptium via an alpha decay sequence:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>294\n117Uus → 290\n115Uup + 4\n2He</dd>\n<dd>290\n115Uup → 286\n113Uut + 4\n2He</dd>\n<dd>286\n113Uut → 282\n111Rg + 4\n2He</dd>\n<dd>282\n111Rg → 278\n109Mt + 4\n2He</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>Isotopes</h2>\n<div>Main article: Isotopes of meitnerium</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<p>Meitnerium has no stable or naturally-occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Seven different isotopes of meitnerium have been reported with atomic masses 266, 268, 270, 274–276, and 278, two of which, meitnerium-268 and meitnerium-270, have known but unconfirmed metastable states. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, although some undergo spontaneous fission.</p>\n<h3>Stability and half-lives</h3>\n<p>All meitnerium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter. The most stable known meitnerium isotope, Mt, is also the heaviest known meitnerium isotope; it has a half-life of 7.6&nbsp;seconds. A metastable nuclear isomer, Mt, has been reported to also have a half-life of over a second. The isotopes Mt and Mt have half-lives of 0.72 and 0.44&nbsp;seconds respectively. The remaining four isotopes have half-lives between 1 and 20&nbsp;milliseconds. The undiscovered isotope Mt has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; however, no known meitnerium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. Some unknown isotopes, such as Mt, Mt, Mt, Mt, and Mt, are predicted to have half-lives longer than the known isotopes. Before its discovery, Mt was also predicted to have a long half-life of 20&nbsp;seconds; however, it was later found to have a shorter half-life of only 0.44&nbsp;seconds.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear isomerism</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Mt</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Two atoms of Mt have been identified in the decay chains of Uut. The two decays have very different lifetimes and decay energies and are also produced from two apparently different isomers of Rg. The first isomer decays by emission of an alpha particle with energy 10.03&nbsp;MeV and has a lifetime of 7.16&nbsp;ms. The other alpha decays with a lifetime of 1.63&nbsp;s; the decay energy was not measured. An assignment to specific levels is not possible with the limited data available and further research is required.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Mt</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>The alpha decay spectrum for Mt appears to be complicated from the results of several experiments. Alpha particles of energies 10.28, 10.22 and 10.10&nbsp;MeV have been observed, emitted from Mt atoms with half-lives of 42&nbsp;ms, 21&nbsp;ms and 102&nbsp;ms respectively. The long-lived decay must be assigned to an isomeric level. The discrepancy between the other two half-lives has yet to be resolved. An assignment to specific levels is not possible with the data available and further research is required.</p>\n<h2>Predicted properties</h2>\n<h3>Chemical</h3>\n<p>Meitnerium is the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals. Since element 112 (copernicium) has been shown to be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would form a fourth transition metal series, with meitnerium as part of the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium, thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.</p>\n<p>Prediction of the probable chemical properties of meitnerium has not received much attention recently. Meitnerium is expected to be a noble metal. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium. Group 9 is the first group in the transition metals to show lower oxidation states than the group number, the +9 state not being known for any element. The oxidation state +9 might be possible for meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF) and the [MtO] cation, although [IrO] is expected to be more stable. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.</p>\n<h3>Physical and atomic</h3>\n<p>Meitnerium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37.4&nbsp;g/cm, which would be the second-highest of any of the 118 known elements, second only to that predicted for its neighbor hassium (41&nbsp;g/cm). In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61&nbsp;g/cm. This results from meitnerium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough meitnerium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. Meitnerium is also predicted to be paramagnetic.</p>\n<p>Theoreticians have predicted the covalent radius of meitnerium to be 6 to 10&nbsp;pm larger than that of iridium. For example, the Mt–O bond distance is expected to be around 1.9&nbsp;Å. The atomic radius of meitnerium is expected to be around 122&nbsp;pm.</p>\n<h2>Experimental chemistry</h2>\n<p>Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of meitnerium has yet to have been established due to the short half-lives of meitnerium isotopes and a limited number of likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale. One of the few meitnerium compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is meitnerium hexafluoride (MtF\n6), as its lighter homologue iridium hexafluoride (IrF\n6) is volatile above 60&nbsp;°C and therefore the analogous compound of meitnerium might also be sufficiently volatile; a volatile octafluoride (MtF\n8) might also be possible. For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1&nbsp;second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of Mt, the most stable known meitnerium isotope, is 7.6&nbsp;seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of meitnerium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the meitnerium isotopes and automated systems can then experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of meitnerium as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements; some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and hassium could be reused. However, the experimental chemistry of meitnerium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements copernicium and flerovium.</p>\n<p>The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory attempted to synthesize the isotope Mt in 2002–2003 for a possible chemical investigation of meitnerium because it was expected that it might be more stable than the isotopes around it as it has 162 neutrons, a magic number for deformed nuclei; its half-life was predicted to be a few seconds, long enough for a chemical investigation. However, no atoms of Mt were detected, and this isotope of meitnerium is currently unknown.</p>\n<p>An experiment determining the chemical properties of a transactinide would need to compare a compound of that transactinide with analogous compounds of some of its lighter homologues: for example, in the chemical characterization of hassium, hassium tetroxide (HsO) was compared with the analogous osmium compound, osmium tetroxide (OsO). In a preliminary step towards determining the chemical properties of meitnerium, the GSI attempted sublimation of the rhodium compounds rhodium(III) oxide (RhO) and rhodium(III) chloride (RhCl). However, macroscopic amounts of the oxide would not sublimate until 1000&nbsp;°C and the chloride would not until 780&nbsp;°C, and then only in the presence of carbon aerosol particles: these temperatures are far too high for such procedures to be used on meitnerium, as most of the current methods used for the investigation of the chemistry of superheavy elements do not work above 500&nbsp;°C.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>^ Emsley, John (2003).
